Welcome to _Tales from the Yawning Portal_. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.

Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.

- A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.
- A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.
- A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.

These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.

The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.

## Using This Book

Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adventures taken from across D&D's history.

The introduction of each adventure provides ideas on adapting it to a variety of D&D settings. Use that information to place it in your campaign or to give you an idea of how to adapt it.

These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as _Storm King's Thunder_, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.

### About the Adventures

#### The Sunless Citadel

_The Sunless Citadel,_ written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.

Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.

#### The Forge of Fury

_The Forge of Fury,_ written by Richard Baker, was published in 2000 shortly after The Sunless Citadel. Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.

Like its predecessor, _The Forge of Fury_ is tailored to provide increasingly tougher threats as the characters make their way through the fortress. Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th level—seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.

#### The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan

_The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,_ written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title _Lost Tamoachan_ at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.

The updated version of the adventure presented herein is designed for a group of four or five 5th-level player characters.

#### White Plume Mountain

Lawrence Schick, the author of _White Plume Mountain_, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but _White Plume_ became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.

The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.

#### Dead in Thay

_Dead in Thay,_ written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was created when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to _Tomb of Horrors, Ruins of Undermountain_, and other "killer dungeons" throughout the history of the game.

The version of _Dead in Thay_ presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.

#### Against the Giants

The three linked adventures that make up _Against the Giants_ were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the _Player's Handbook_ for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.

The compilation of _Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl_, and _Hall of the Fire Giant King_ was published in 1981 as _Against the Giants_. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.

#### Tomb of Horrors

Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&D game, there was the _Tomb of Horrors_.

The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of _Tomb of Horrors_, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.

As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime

### Running the Adventures

To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edition _Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide_, and _Monster Manual_. Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared before the action starts.

> Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.

The _Monster Manual_ contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment mentioned in the book are described in the _Player's Handbook_. Magic items are described in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_, unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description in appendix A.

### Creating a Campaign

While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign-over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest-they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.

Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.

The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.

## The Yawning Portal

Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.

In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.

For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.

All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.

Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.

Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.

### The Green Dragon Inn

The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.

### Features of the Yawning Portal

The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The "well" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.

Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.

#### Entering the Well

Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to "ride the rope") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.

#### Oddities on Display

A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.

#### A Typical Evening

On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.

Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.

### Starting the Story

Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern). This approach is a cliché, but it is an effective one. Use the following two tables to generate a couple of details, then tailor the particulars of the quest and the quest giver to suit the adventure you plan to run.

#### Mysterious Stranger Quest

| <span class="text-center block">d8</span> | Objective |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1</span> | Recover a particular item |
| <span class="text-center block">2</span> | Find and return with an NPC or monster |
| <span class="text-center block">3</span> | Slay a terrible monster or NPC |
| <span class="text-center block">4</span> | Guard a person while they perform a ritual |
| <span class="text-center block">5</span> | Create an accurate map of part of the dungeon |
| <span class="text-center block">6</span> | Discover secret lore hidden in the dungeon |
| <span class="text-center block">7</span> | Destroy an object |
| <span class="text-center block">8</span> | Sanctify part of the dungeon to a god of good |

#### Mysterious Stranger Secret

#### Durnan

The proprietor of the Yawning Portal is something of an enigma. Blessed with a seemingly limitless life span by treasures he brought back from his expedition nearly two centuries ago, he is as much a fixture in the tap room as the well.

Durnan is a man of few words. He expects to be paid for his time, and will offer insight and rumors only in return for hard cash. "We know the odds and take our chances," he says, whether he is breaking up a card game that has turned violent or refusing the pleas of adventurers trapped at the bottom of the well who are unable to pay for a ride up. Despite his stony heart, he is an excellent source of information about Undermountain and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.

![Durnan](adventure/TftYP/AtGDurnan.jpg)

##### Personality Trait: Isolation

It's a cruel world. All people have to fend for themselves. Self-sufficiency is the only path to success.

##### Ideal: Independence

Someone who can stand alone can stand against anything.

##### Bond: The Yawning Portal

This place is my only home. My friends and family are long gone. I love this place, but I try not to get attached to the people here. I'll outlive them all. Lucky me.

##### Flaw: Heartless

If you want sympathy, the Temple of Ilmater is in the Sea Ward. No matter how bad things are, you'll be gone in a blink of an eye.

#### Other Denizens

The Yawning Portal is host to a variety of regular visitors, most of whom offer services to adventurers. Chapter 4 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ provides plenty of resources for generating nonplayer characters. The following table provides some possibilities for why an individual is visiting the Yawning Portal.

##### Denizens

| <span class="text-center block">d10</span> | Denizen |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1</span> | Devotee of Tymora, encourages adventures to seek out quests, can cast bless |
| <span class="text-center block">2</span> | Bored, retired adventurer, claims to have explored dungeon of note and can describe first few areas (20 percent chance of an accurate description) |
| <span class="text-center block">3</span> | Heckler, mocks cowards and makes bets that adventurers won't return from an expedition |
| <span class="text-center block">4</span> | Con artist, selling fake treasure maps (but a 10 percent chance that a map is genuine) |
| <span class="text-center block">5</span> | Wizard's apprentice, carefully making exact sketches of various curios at her master's command |
| <span class="text-center block">6</span> | Spouse of a slain adventurer, who pays the toll for anyone wanting to exit Undermountain and plots against Durnan |
| <span class="text-center block">7</span> | Zhentarim agent, seeks rumors of treasure, tails any folk who return from Undermountain and notes their home base for future robbery |
| <span class="text-center block">8</span> | Agent of the Xanathar, ordered to "steal the hat worn by the eighth person to enter the taproom this night" |
| <span class="text-center block">9</span> | Magically preserved corpse in a coffin leaning against the bar; if asked about it, Durnan says, "He's waiting for someone," and nothing more |
| <span class="text-center block">10</span> | Elminster, incognito; 10 percent chance he is on an errand of cosmic importance; otherwise, he's pressing Durnan for gossip |

## Against the Giants

Giants have been raiding civilized lands in bands, with giants of different sorts in these marauding groups. Death and destruction have been laid heavily upon every place these monsters have visited. This has caused great anger in high places, for life and property loss means failure of the vows of noble rulers to protect the life and goods of each and every subject-and possible lean times for the rulers as well as the ruled. Therefore, a party of the bravest and most powerful adventurers has been assembled and given the charge to punish the miscreant giants. Characters whose homes lay in the devastated land probably need little more motivation to face their oppressors.

The first stage of the characters' mission is an infiltration and assault of the Steading of the Hill Giant Chief. From there, if they succeed, the adventurers can advance to test their mettle against the even more formidable giants of frost and fire, but that is of no concern right now-the steading awaits, and its perils are plentiful.

### Running the Adventures

This is a series of three linked adventures. It is designed for a group of four or five player characters of 11th level. If the characters persevere, they are likely to advance in level at the end of each section of the story. Only strong and experienced characters should adventure into these giants' areas if the party consists of no more than four characters. The characters should have magic items to help them overcome the challenges they face. For a small party, the most important qualities are experience and caution. A group of four well-played characters can expect a reasonable chance of survival if they use their knowledge and cunning to best advantage.

These adventures were designed for strategic play, so some areas of the giant settlements are very dangerous even for characters of the recommended level. Further, adventurers who call too much attention to themselves are likely to be doomed. It takes only one or two extra giants in an encounter to turn a manageable situation into a very deadly one.

Therefore, be free with information the players need to make informed decisions. For example, any seasoned adventurer can see that the giants in the great hall of the steading represent an overwhelming challenge. So, the question becomes how to accomplish punishing the giants and discovering what is influencing them without having to face so many at once. The adventure contains some possible answers.

Keep track of the fate of important giants and their allies or captives. Escaping adversaries will generally flee to the next higher-ranking stronghold (from the steading to the rift and from the rift to Snurre's hall); freed captives may join forces with their rescuers (this is a good way to introduce replacement player characters). This assumes survival of the individuals, of course, as well as opportunity for them to act. Some provision for the movement of surviving giants is given in the latter scenarios, but you will have to modify these according to the outcome of previous adventuring by your group.

#### Placing the Adventures

The preferred habitats of hill giants, frost giants, and fire giants exist in virtually every D&D setting, so it's not too difficult to find locations for the strongholds and the events in Against the Giants.

##### Dragonlance

On Krynn, the alliance of giants could center on the Kharolis Mountains, bringing Abanasinia, Qualinesti, Thorbardin, Kharolis, and Tarsis into the conflict. The ultimate villains in the Dragonlance setting would have to be dark exiles of an even more unexpected sort than those described in this adventure.

##### Eberron

The giant conspiracy could have its roots in faraway Xen'drik, with an outpost in Breland serving as the hill giant steading. Or the giants could be from Droaam, perhaps acting against the wishes of the Daughters of Sora Kell due to another sinister influence.

##### Forgotten Realms

In Faerûn, the giants could be raiding the Sword Coast after emerging from the Sword Mountains or the Sunset Mountains or the Spine of the World. They might be preparing to move on Damara from out of the Galena Mountains, or to descend upon the Dalelands and Cormyr from the Stormhorns or the Thunder Peaks.

##### Greyhawk

The giants might threaten Geoff, Sterich, or other nearby realms from out of the Crystalmists, the Jotens, or even the infamous Barrier Peaks.

### Customizing the Giants

If you want to add some variability to the encounters in these adventures, a good way to do this is by modifying the armor and weapons the giants use. In particular, the servants and the young that are found among the giants might not be outfitted with the gear described in the statistics used for them. Servants could use improvised weapons, such as giant-sized tools and utensils they have available. If you decide to change any giant's melee weapon to some other giant-sized weapon, adjust its damage accordingly: Huge giants deal three times normal weapon damage, and Large giants, such as ogres, deal twice normal weapon damage.

When a giant uses the statistics of an ogre, that creature might use throwing rocks for ranged attacks (assuming any are on hand) rather than the ogre's standard weaponry. If projectiles are available, throwing rocks is always a giant's best (and preferred) ranged attack.

#### Giant's Bags

Many opportunities arise throughout these adventures for the characters to search miscellaneous bags and chests that belong to giants. The contents of these containers can be determined randomly by using the following table. Roll 3d4 to determine the number of different items among the contents, then roll d100 for each item and refer to the table to determine its nature. Either apply the result of the roll or use it as inspiration for something along the same lines.

##### Giant's Bag Contents
