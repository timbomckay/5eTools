Just as the trail led from the Steading of the Hill Giant Chief to the frozen wastes wherein was found the Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, so the adventure in the latter place has led (or transported) the intrepid party to what they hope will be their last challenge. They are about to venture into the hot and smoking barrens which are in effect Muspelheim, the home of the fire giants. In the vast rocky halls of the fire giants' doughty liege lord, the dread King Snurre Iron Belly, they hope to find not only great treasure but the answer to the question of what or who is behind the strange alliance of many different types of giants. Surely here in the stronghold of the fire giants will be encountered the evil genius or geniuses controlling the uprising and planning the well-executed attacks, for Snurre is said to be far stronger than smart.

It is a sad fact that the characters can expect all encounters here to be worse than those the party has faced elsewhere, for fire giants are ferocious opponents, and their associates and helpers will undoubtedly be proportionately stronger and more fearsome than those of the lesser hill and frost giants-a sobering thought indeed! Surely the rewards for success cannot fail to be greater, for the fire giants-and their masters, perhaps-have more loot for the taking.

If the party (or one or more members thereof) has been to the other two places, the characters will know that there is a charge upon them to report definite information to the rulers who have sent them forth to inflict punishment on the rapacious giant raiders. Their mission: to slay fire giants and all who associate with them. Failure means death, not from the nobles, but from the monsters the party must face. Success means the right to keep all the loot they find, plus the possibility of reward from the rulers of the lands being ravaged by the giant bands.

And now the adventurers stand before the black and smoking slag hill that holds the Hall of the Fire Giant King. They have penetrated near the heart of the matter-into a fell realm where even the strongest need beware!

### Running the Adventure

As with the previous adventures in this series, it is up to you to add to the considerable detail given herein, filling in any needed information to color the whole and bring it to life. You, as Dungeon Master, must continue to improvise and create, for your players will certainly desire more specifics, seek to do things not provided for herein, and generally defy expectation. The script is here, but you will direct the whole, rewrite parts, and sit in final judgment on characters' actions.

If you have already taken your players through the first two adventures, be particularly mindful of how their behavior there will have altered what is described here. Use the parameters given to design your own epic. Be disinterested, and be just. This is a very difficult scenario, and the players might rue thoughtless actions, but do not allow this reaction to temper what you have before you. Likewise, do not set about to entrap the characters in a hopeless situation-allow their actions to dictate their fate.

Remember also that these giants are not only the toughest so far encountered but also have the best advice immediately available to them. As soon as the party strikes and then retires, the attack will be assessed and countermeasures taken. Even when the party first enters the hall, you will have to gauge the reaction of the giants if and when they learn that intruders are within. How will they react? From whence will they call in guards? Where will Snurre go? Most assuredly, he will not remain seated upon his throne when an attack is in progress! You have not ceased being a Dungeon Master by using this prepared scenario; you have simply had some details handled for you so that you can better script the more important material.

When the party retires from the hall to rest, the fire giants will lay whatever traps and ambushes they are able to prepare under the circumstances. Lights will be smothered, sentries posted, and so forth. In the original playtest, the giants who survived the first foray by the (exceptionally strong and well-played) party set several ambushes, each surprise being timed to allow them to retreat quickly behind a turn in a passage or through a set of doors, gradually falling back to the corridor to the lower level. While the characters offered no quarter and slew every giant or other creature encountered with absolute ruthlessness, their opponents fought with reckless abandon and self-sacrifice.

How you manage this conflict in your game must be based on knowledge that only you can have. The upshot of this whole series of adventures is a fight to the finish. Only the leaders and those they take with them will normally seek to move to a place of safety; the rest will stand fast and battle to the end.

### Adventure Start

The party might have arrived before the huge obsidian valves that bar entrance to the hall by means of the transporter found in the lair of the frost giant jarl. In this case, they will have to search to find a place of safety to rest and recover their strength between forays into the hall.

If the group journeyed hence by some other method, they will have noted such a place of refuge about two miles distant from Snurre's sooty palace. This hidden site should initially prove to be safe from detection as long as the characters leave no plain trail to it and as long as they are not followed to it. There is a limit, though, to how far they can push their luck. Each time they venture forth from their refuge to raid the fire giant hall, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that the hidey-hole will be found by the giants (a 10 percent chance after the first raid, 20 percent following the second, and so forth).

A nearby ravine leads directly from the safe cave to the spiny, broken heap of slag indicated on the characters' map as the site of the hall. A wide, well-trod path winds its way across the barren land up to two great slabs of black stone-the obsidian portals that give access to Snurre's hall. Each valve is 29 feet tall, 10 feet wide, and no less than 3 feet thick. Normal human strength cannot even budge them; for Medium or smaller creatures to open them requires at least two characters working together to make a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. On the second and any successive raids upon the place, there is a 50 percent likelihood that the gates will be ajar, and some guard will be watching for attackers in order to alert the hall.

The plain around the stronghold is most evil and drab in appearance. The sky is gray and filled with sooty clouds. A distant volcano can be seen, and far to the south a glowing river of molten lava moves sluggishly down a slope and out of sight. The air is hot and smells of heated rock and metal. The ground is covered with cinders and sharp rocks that make walking cross-country difficult (and noisy). The area is lit by night with dim red light, both from flaming gases that shoot forth out of the bowels of the earth and from the glow of molten rock.

The pile of lava, slag, and jutting black rock that houses the Hall of Snurre is a steeply rising hill about 300 feet high at its summit. It is difficult to scale. Smoking vents are everywhere, and some of these holes spurt out jets of flame from time to time. The characters will never locate any entrance into the place other than by the main gate, and there is a 33 percent chance that any member investigating a vent hole will be struck by flaming gases for 7 (2d6) fire damage.

## Entrance Level: General Features

Map 6.5 shows the layout of the uppermost level of the fire giant stronghold. The floors, walls, and ceilings throughout the place are of black, reddish-black, dark gray, and dull brown rock. In some places the stone has been hewn, but in others it appears to have been fused by heat.

### Ceilings

Passageways in the hall have vaulted ceilings 30 feet high. Caves, chambers, and rooms are 40 to 60 feet high.

### Doors

All doors are made of iron plates. A Medium or smaller creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to open any of the doors in this place due to their great size and weight. Doors stay open if left that way.

### Illumination

The upper level of Snurre's hall is lit by torches, braziers, and natural gas jets.

### Locks

The hall contains numerous well-made locks. Someone using thieves' tools can pick a lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

### Secret Doors

Secret doors in the hall are precisely crafted. Unless otherwise noted, it requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door.

### Random Encounters

On the entrance level of the fire giant stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d12. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- One fire giant guard
- One fire giant with 12 gnoll workers
- Four young fire giants (use the ogre statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) with two hell hounds
- One cloud giant, one frost giant, or one stone giant, a visitor looking around

![Fire L1 2-Players](adventure/TftYP/AtGFire-L1-2-Players.jpg)

![Fire L1 3-Players](adventure/TftYP/AtGFire-L1-3-Players.jpg)

## 1. Entry Passage

The floor here is polished obsidian, and great wall hangings can be seen by the characters as soon as they enter. The tapestries displayed between the torches are rendered in bloody colors and show victorious fire giants. The door guard is hidden in the alcove (**area 1A**).

![Fire L1 1-Players](adventure/TftYP/AtGFire-L1-1-Players.jpg)

## 1A. Alcove

The tapestry that covers the opening to this guard post is of loose weave, allowing the fire giant guard in the dark recess to clearly see whoever enters the corridor. If intruders are spotted, he sounds his great bronze horn to warn the hall (see **area 2**). The giant has four rocks for throwing.

If the characters are returning after severely defeating the giants, a ballista (from the arsenal at 10A) will be set up at the far end of the hallway in anticipation of a second raid. This weapon is triggered by a nearly invisible tripwire set 30 feet inside the entrance, and someone must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find the wire. Once the wire is found, it can be avoided, but cutting it sets off the ballista. The ballista fires an array of bolts down the length of the hall, so each creature in it is subjected to one attack at a +6 bonus to hit, dealing 11 (2d10) piercing damage on a hit.

## 2. Grand Hall

Two ettin are always in the hall that runs east-west off the entry passage, using their four heads to watch in all directions. If the guard at the gate sounds the alarm, these creatures move to hold the mouth of the entryway until help arrives from **area 3**, **area 18**, or areas 21-25.

### Links

The floor of the grand hall is of reddish-black, highly polished stone. The pillars are carved into the shapes of dwarves, each straining to hold up the figure atop it. Light flickers weirdly from burning gases that spurt from the walls. One of the tapestries on the south wall screens the entrance to the royal apartment (areas 4-7).

## 3. Throne Room and Audience Chamber

Two steps of white-veined black marble lead up to an area where the floor is of deep red polished stone, Between two pillars of polished obsidian sits a massive throne made of jet and black-and-white-banded onyx, the whole inlaid with various large gems. The walls are inlaid with colored stone laid out to show various scenes of victory by King Snurre over his foes. On the wall directly behind the throne is depicted the flaming skull which is Snurre's own device, flanked by fire giants with clubs over their shoulders. The northern one of these inlaid giant-images conceals a secret door hidden in the wall; a cresset to the left of it, when pulled down, causes the portal to swing inward.

![King Snurre](adventure/TftYP/AtGKing-Snurre.jpg)

King Snurre is seated on the black seat of the throne. Over 19 feet tall, he is hugely muscled and extraordinarily ugly-very broad, with bandy legs. His teeth are tusk-like and protruding, his side whiskers and beard bright orange and full. Snurre is clad in black iron plate armor, and he wields a huge greatsword that displays flames running along its blade when it is swung. The king wears a necklace of coral skulls and has a broad girdle set with small gems. Around his shoulders is a cape made of white dragon hide.

When he sits on the throne, he wears his jewel-studded crown of iron. Otherwise the crown is in his bag and his bald pate covered by an iron helmet.

King Snurre is a fire giant with the following changes, which increase his challenge rating to 11 (7,200 XP):

- He has 187 (15d12+90) hit points.
- He has resistance to cold damage.
- He can speak Common and Giant.
- His greatsword deals an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage on a hit.

Two fire giant guard the king at all times; their positions are indicated by the circled numbers 1 and 2. Each giant has a carved stone to throw. Crouching at positions 3 and 4 are a pair of hell hound, the king's constant companions.

### Treasure

Snurre's crown is set with six rubies (worth 500 gp each), six diamonds (500 gp each), and a huge jacinth (1,000 gp). His necklace has a value of 1,000 gp, and his girdle is decorated with sixty-six garnets (worth 10 gp each). His magic cape grants resistance to cold damage.

The gems embedded in Snurre's throne include twelve pieces of sard (worth 100 gp each), twelve fire opals (worth 250 gp each), and twelve rubies (500 gp each).

## 4. Chamber of the Queen's Servants

The walls of the grand hall are covered with hide rugs and wall hangings, one of which screens the entrance to the queen's private chamber.

Inside this entryway are torches on the walls, and six chairs and three small tables along the hallway. At the end of the route westward is a chamber that holds four beds, four chests, two wardrobes, and four stools.

Three fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) are present here, one waiting outside the queen's chamber and two more in the end chamber. Each fights fiercely to protect the queen, with those at the end chamber rushing to aid the other. The servants wield longswords that deal 18 (3d8+5) slashing damage on a hit.

### Treasure

Each of the servants wears three pieces of jewelry worth 250 gp apiece. Amid the eighty-one hides, pelts, skins, and furs in the end chamber are five of value-the seventeenth, twenty-fourth, fortieth, fifty-ninth, and seventy-seventh items that the characters examine are worth 200 gp each.

## 5. Queen's Chamber

The floors and walls in the chamber north of the servants' quarters are covered with rich rugs and tapestries of no great value. The place is well lit by torches and a large brazier, and this makes it very hot indeed (just right for fire giants!).

Queen Frupy, who resides here, is a veritable harridan, a sly and cunning fire giant. She is, if anything, uglier than Snurre. Topped by a huge mass of yellow-orange hair that looks like a fright wig, Queen Frupy's face is a mass of jowls and wrinkles set in the middle of a very large head that seems to grow directly out of her shoulders without the benefit of any neck. Her body is lumpy and gross, her skin covered with bristles the color of her hair. Her little pig eyes, however, are bright, suggesting intelligence unusual in a giant.

Her chamber contains a giant-sized bed covered with furs, a table and two chairs, a stool, and a dressing table with a huge mirror of seeing (weighing 100 pounds) that functions similarly to a gem of seeing, so that even unseen creatures and objects are reflected in it. (Frupy uses it if she suspects invisible creatures are about.) Also here are an ebony and mother-of-pearl wardrobe (filled with her clothing), an iron strongbox, a chest of twelve drawers, four small coffers of copper on the table, and two bronze caskets. Each bronze casket has a poisonous snake inside, which must be dealt with before the contents can be accessed (see "Treasure").

The queen wears garments of black dragon hide set with iron studs (giving her an AC equivalent to that of plate armor). She wields an iron scepter as a weapon (treat as a maul with the same statistics as a fire giant's greatsword, except that it deals bludgeoning damage). Out of sight under the bed are Frupy's two pets, a pair of giant weasel that obey her every command If intruders enter the place, Queen Frupy will command them to kneel in her august presence and state their business, so that she may fairly address their humble requests. Any who are so foolish as to do so will be sorry, as Frupy will call forth her pets and herself strike at the intruder who appears to be the most powerful. (A kneeling character is considered to be prone in this situation.) She will then bellow for her servants to come to her aid.

### Treasure

One of the bronze caskets holds 400 cp, and the other one has 300 pp concealed beneath a layer of 100 cp.

If the lid of the strongbox is opened by anyone but Frupy, a <wc-fetch type="spell">glyph of warding</wc-fetch> inside is triggered, producing a _firebal_ l spell centered on the chest (save DC 15). The strongbox itself holds nothing of value, but it has a trick panel in the side, which requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.

The panel, if opened, allows access to a jade box (worth 500 gp). This box has a false bottom, found with another successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, that contains spell scrolls of two random 7th-level spells of a particular class (DM's choice).

All but one of the copper coffers contain unguents and the like; the third coffer examined contains four pieces of gem-set gold jewelry worth 750 gp each.

The drawers in the chest hold worthless personal articles, except for the fifth drawer from the bottom, where under some underthings Queen Frupy has concealed three potions: <wc-fetch type="item">potion of fire resistance</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">potion of mind control (beast)</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="item">potion of mind control (monster)</wc-fetch>, the latter of which she plans to use on the king.

Finally, Frupy wears six pieces of gem-set jewelry worth 500 gp each.

## 6. Chamber of the King's Guards

Beyond the doors that lead north, along the east and west walls of the short hallway, are a total of twelve throwing rocks lined up ready for use. Two fire giant, off-duty guards, relax in the adjoining chamber. Each has a carved throwing rock and a greatsword nearby.

A table and two benches sit in the center of the room. The table has several platters and flagons on it, along with a small cask of wine and a wheel of cheese covered with mold. Two wooden lockers are tucked under the table.

### Treasure

Hidden inside the cheese in a hollowed-out space are five 100 gp gems. (This is the repository for the wealth of the on-duty guards.)

Each of the lockers contains ordinary clothing and 150 gp. Each guard carries three gems worth 100 gp each in a belt pouch.

## 7. King Snurre's Private Quarters

The great iron doors to this place bear the blazon of the flaming skull also found in the throne room. The doors open into an outer hall where six hell hound roam.

The walls in the outer hall are set with torches in cressets and draped with crude tapestries. Six chairs and two benches lie along the walls, along with three tables-each with a keg of ale, beer, or mead and drinking vessels of horn or leather at hand. A small step up on either side of a natural stone column of reddish stone marks the end of the outer hall and the entry to the king's private chamber.

The bedchamber of the king is lit in an eerie manner by flaming jets of gas and a huge iron brazier full of glowing coals. The room contains a huge, fur-covered bed, a table, a small throne of ebony and three lesser chairs, a tall cabinet, four trunks, an iron chest at the foot of the bed, and a bench near the entry. The floor is covered with pelts, and the walls are hung with tapestries and trophies: two shields, an axe, four swords, a flail, and a hammer. All these items are sized for giants. A ledge on the south wall 9 feet above the floor holds thirty-nine skulls (human, dwarf, elf, giant, and other various and sundry creatures), eight helmets and helms, and five sets of armor (chain mail, splint, or plate as you desire).

The containers in the room hold the personal gear of King Snurre, consisting of clothing, footwear, and bits of armor. Arrayed on the table are several small items including pieces of carved ivory, animal teeth, bits of wood, and stones. Together these items, the king believes, can be made to serve as a divination device.

### Treasure

Aside from all the mundane armor and weapons, the only item of value to be had here is one of the stones on the table, which is an uncarved piece of carnelian worth 100 gp.

### Secret Exit

A stone projects out of the wall to the left of the secret door, 12 feet above the floor. Pushing the stone in causes the portal to pivot, revealing an opening 10 feet wide and 10 feet high.

## 8. Hydra Cave

A hydra lurks in either the north or the south alcove of this area if it hears any creature coming up the steps toward its lair. The creature is very vicious, as the king beats it and torments it for fun, and it hopes to take revenge on virtually any other living thing.

## 9. King Snurre's Treasure Cave

The chamber to the west of the hydra's lair is filled with stuff, much of which is valueless or nearly so-a pile of 2,800 cp, three mounds of 4d4 worthless tapestries and furs, several dozen bales of valueless cloth, scores of various vessels and containers, and urns and vases of pewter and brass and bronze, plus ten urns of silver (worth 50 gp each) and two of gold (worth 500 gp each).

A chimney in the southeastern part of the cave leads up through the roof.

### Treasure

The real wealth in the room is held inside nearly twenty different containers-eight iron trunks, six smaller chests, and five even smaller coffers. As the characters investigate and attempt to open them, they discover features and contents as follows. Opening a locked one requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

**Trunk 1** is locked. It contains 7,200 sp.

**Trunk 2** is locked. It contains nothing.

**Trunk 3** is unlocked and has no defenses. At the bottom is s sack holding ten pieces of jewelry (worth 500 gp each). It is buried under a heap of 6,000 cp.

**Trunk 4** is locked and trapped. It contains 3 cubic feet of silk, worth 300 gp per cubic foot. If the trunk is opened without the key, a blade springs from the lid and chops down at one target, with a +11 bonus to hit and dealing 13 (3d8) slashing damage on a hit. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot alterations to the lock and hinges that are part of the trap mechanism. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check by someone using thieves' tools can be used to disable the hinge mechanism. If the trap goes off but the blade misses, it chops through 2 cubic feet of the silk, ruining it.

**Trunk 5** is locked. It contains eight pieces of rare wood, each the size of a mace and inlaid with mother-of-pearl (worth 100 gp apiece).

**Trunk 6** is unlocked and has no defenses. It contains 1,300 ep.

**Trunk 7** is locked. It contains ten fine ivory tusks each weighing 5 pounds and worth 150 gp.

**Trunk 8** is unlocked. When it is opened, it initially appears empty because all of its contents are invisible. The chest holds six pieces of jewelry worth 250 gp each as well as nine poisonous snakes.

**Chest 1** is unlocked and trapped. If its lid is lifted, poisonous gas billows forth and spreads out to fill a 10-foot-radius area around it. Those within the cloud when it erupts must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until they finish a short or long rest. The chest is empty.

**Chest 2** is locked. It contains worthless rocks.

**Chest 3** is unlocked and trapped. If its lid is lifted before the trap is disabled, acid sprays out from small holes in the sides, splattering anyone within 10 feet of the chest. Those in the affected area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character discovers that the hinges are connected to a valve, disguised as a decoration, that pressurizes the acid in the chest walls. The trap can be disabled by someone who uses thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check.

To determine the contents of the chest, consult chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Roll four times on Magic Item Table A, two times on Table B, two times on Table C, once on Table D, and once on Table E. Any result that is not a potion or a scroll should be disregarded but not rerolled.

**Chest 4** is unlocked and trapped. It contains 1,600 gp. If its lid is lifted before the trap is disabled, numerous spikes shoot forward, backward, and to each side. Each spike has a range of 15 feet and a +11 bonus to hit, dealing 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a hit. Anyone within 15 feet of the chest might be hit. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices that the hinges are connected to four valves, disguised as decorations, that pressurize the spikes in the chest walls. Thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check can be used to disable the valves.

**Chest 5** is locked. It contains nothing.

**Chest 6** is locked and trapped. It contains a cloak of elvenkind and a pair of boots of elvenkind. The lock and the chest's handles are coated with oil of taggit (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_). With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character spots the oil. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check, or any character who has proficiency with a poisoner's kit, knows that the oil can be wiped off with alcohol, although doing so without wearing protective clothing is risky, requiring a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. On a failed check, the character is exposed to the poison.

**Coffer 1** is unlocked and trapped. It contains thirty gold rings, one of which is a ring of protection. The others are ordinary rings worth 50 gp each. If the treasure is touched before the trap is disabled, a poison needle shoots from the inner side of the coffer, hitting the extremity that was extended. The needle deals 1 piercing damage and delivers a dose of purple worm poison (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the _Dungeon Master's Guid_ e). With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character discovers the recess in the coffer wall that holds the needle. A character can remove the needle, thereby disabling the trap, by using thieves' tools and making a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

**Coffer 2** is locked. It contains 200 pp concealed beneath a layer of 500 cp.

**Coffer 3** is locked. It holds packets of leaves and seeds and husks-various hot spices worth a total of 100 gp.

**Coffer 4** is unlocked. It contains six small, highly crafted, carved statues of unknown mineral and workmanship. All register as desecrated objects to the scrutiny of Divine Sense or a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect evil and good</wc-fetch> spell. Each idol is associated with a different ability score. While one is carried, its bearer has disadvantage on all d20 rolls involving that particular ability score.

**Coffer 5** is locked. It holds sixteen gems (worth 250 gp each) concealed beneath a layer of two hundred gems worth 10 gp each, further topped by five hundred gems of good size and fine appearance but worth only 1 gp each.

## 10. Arsenal Complex

A fire giant is always at the ready inside the entrance to this storage area. If summoned or attacked, the guard fetches the chimera from **area 11**. The guard has three throwing rocks at hand. Torches provide light, and a bench offers a place to sit down.

### 10A. West Arsenal

The western wing contains fifteen huge swords, a ballista, twenty spears, three maces, five greataxes, and a quantity of giant-sized throwing rocks.

### Treasure

Hidden in the far southwestern corner under the spears are a <wc-fetch type="item">+1 longbow</wc-fetch> and a quiver of twenty <wc-fetch type="item">+1 Arrow</wc-fetch>.

### 10B. East Arsenal

The eastern wing has another supply of throwing rocks, five massive clubs, nine fire giant helmets, two chain shirts, eight shields, and eight studded leather jacks-all giant-sized. Eight big barrels of oil are stored along the east side of the area.

### Treasure

One of the giant-sized shields is actually a shield of missile attraction.

## 11. Chimera Pen

The fire giants keep a chimera here. This creature attacks intruders on sight, since it hates everyone except fire giants.

## 12. Advisor's Quarters

A corridor heads westward from the pillared hallway. The corridor and the chamber beyond contain furnishings of various sizes. The smallest of them are a table, a plush chair with a footstool, and a couch. Other items are more or less human-sized, including a long table, two benches, two chairs, and twelve chests. Finally, there are four huge chairs, a table, and a footstool sized for giants. Rugs on the floor, tapestries on the walls, and bronze cressets with flaming torches complete the decor.

Eight gnoll servants/bodyguards are lounging in this area, awaiting orders. They obey only the commands of King Snurre, Queen Frupy, or the Advisor-who is is a grossly fat but very strong and quite fast renegade mountain dwarf named Obmi (see **area 12A**).

### Treasure

The chests contain the treasure of each gnoll (amounting to 50 gp each) plus the gnolls' personal gear. The third, eighth, tenth, and twelfth chests that the characters examine are locked; they contain bottles of wine and spirits.

## 12A. Obmi's Study

The door to this study appears to be locked from the outside, suggesting that the place is vacant (Obmi is very clever). He can see through the door by means of a peephole, and if he sees intruders who are battling the gnolls and winning he will yell for them to help him, claiming to be a victim and a prisoner of the giants.

In fact, at first sight, this chamber appears to be a cell rather than a truly comfortable study. Obmi is at work in the room, poring over several scrolls atop his plain wooden desk, searching for solutions for the problems besetting his King. The dwarf has been Snurre's advisor for twenty-five years, having spent five years as a slave before that. A case against the north wall contains various maps, scrolls, and papers, all written in Giant or Dwarvish.

![Obmi](adventure/TftYP/AtGObmi.jpg)

If he finds himself at a disadvantage, Obmi (use the assassin statistics, with 16 Strength and Charisma and the ability to make three melee attacks using Multiattack) tells the characters that the giants have held him-a prince of his people-captive for ten years, trying to trick information out of him or to subvert his loyalty to dwarfdom when torture failed. He further claims that several humans in black robes aid the giants in their questioning. Finally, he asks to be allowed his armor and weapons in order to gain sweet revenge upon Snurre, and he claims to know exactly where the king will be.

While in his study, Obmi has only a studded leather jacket and a long knife (the equivalent of a shortsword, coated with one dose of the poison noted in the assassin statistics). If worst comes to worst, he bolts for room 12B and bars the door once he is inside.

### Treasure

Obmi uses a plain wooden box as a footstool. It seemingly holds only old clothes of his-but beneath a false bottom, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, some gems are hidden: two worth 500 gp each, eight worth 100 gp each, twenty-three worth 50 gp each, forty-one worth 10 gp each, and eighteen worth 5 gp each.

## 12B. Obmi's Bedchamber

In a larger chamber adjacent to his study, the renegade dwarf has a soft bed, a small stand, a table and chair, a cabinet, two iron chests, and an arming rack. His <wc-fetch type="item">dwarven plate</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type="item">+1 shield</wc-fetch> (AC 20, or AC 23 with his shield) are laid on the rack near the door, and his <wc-fetch type="item">+1 battleaxe</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type="item">+1 warhammer</wc-fetch> (each deals 1d8+4 damage in Obmi's hands) hang on the wall above. Underneath the armor are his <wc-fetch type="item">gauntlets of ogre power</wc-fetch> (giving him an additional +1 to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons). His <wc-fetch type="item">ring of invisibility</wc-fetch> is on a small stand near his bed.

Upon entering the room Obmi will palm the ring, don the armor, put on the gauntlets, thong the axe to his belt, heft the hammer, and grab the shield. At the first good opportunity he will attack the party and raise a cry for help, but he will do so only when he knows help will be able to come. He knows a bit about the drow, and he will bargain with that information, or anything else, to save his life. If offered no quarter, he will fight to the very end.

### Treasure

In addition to Obmi's magical gear, both of the iron chests contain valuables. One chest holds 900 gp. The other holds 100 pp and a bejeweled silver ewer and silver bowl (each item worth 500 gp).

## 13. Council Room

The king and his council meet in this large chamber, but the place is now empty. A long table near the center of the room has five great chairs around it. Hides cover parts of the polished black floor. Rude tapestries adorn the walls and are also hung across the openings around the perimeter of the room. There are several torches in the place, but none are lit.

## 13A. West Alcove

Within the alcove to the west is a table with a flat chest on it, locked and full of stones (weighing 200 pounds). If the chest is lifted or moved, a pressure plate underneath it shifts, causing six poisoned arrows to shoot out from the north wall. Each arrow has a range of 100 feet and a +11 bonus to hit; it deals 5 (1d10) piercing damage on a hit, and the target struck must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The arrows strike the south wall and shatter if they miss interposing creatures.

The holes for the arrows are sealed with a thin crust of mortar. A character who examines the wall spots them with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Someone who looks carefully at the base of the chest can spot the pressure plate with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The holes can be blocked by hammering iron pitons or similar objects into them. The pressure plate can be wedged in place with the use of at least two such objects. In either case, a character attempting to disarm the trap must succeed on a DC 10 Strength check. On a failed check, the trap operates anyway when the attempt to block it fails.

### Treasure

A map of the area around the stronghold hangs on the western wall. Two locked chests rest against the north and south walls-the northern one filled with 850 sp, the southern one holding 500 gp and six bone batons with Dwarvish runes upon them.

Each of the batons is a token of free passage whose runes read, in Giant, "Official Business on Behalf of King Snurre the Fearsome." Any individuals or groups that display one of these items are safe from attacks by the giants or the giants' allies as long as they take no aggressive action.

## 13B. South Alcove

Four extra chairs for the council table are stored in the alcove to the south, and a huge cabinet holds eighty-three scrolls and three hundred sixty-seven pieces of paper or parchment.

Most of the cabinet's contents are worthless and of no import, but the sixty-eighth scroll tube contains instructions for King Snurre, telling him to gather forces of hill, stone, frost, and fire giants, along with whatever strength he can raise in ogres, oni, cloud giants, and any other creatures for an all-out attack on humankind. The message further promises powerful help from the dark elves. It is signed "Eclavdra."

The papers are copies of messages to and replies from various types of giants and giant-kin. One, in Dwarvish, reads, "The fire giant of stone left and left elbow."

## 14. Door Guard

A fire giant stands guard at all times outside the doors to the council chambers.

## 15. Kitchen

Benches, counters, a table, several stools, three cupboards, various bins and barrels, and miscellaneous kitchen gear are scattered around the kitchen. The area to the west is a natural firepit, where flaming gases are used to roast whole creatures.

The place is typically occupied by busy workers: a fire giant matron, two fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage), and seven gnoll thralls. The servants and the gnolls fight only under the direction of the matron, fleeing or surrendering if she falls.

### Slippery Exit

The chute to the northwest goes down to the lava pool on the second level (**area 6**). Six feet in diameter, it is slippery and greasy from garbage and empties out 2 feet above the lava.

## 16. Storage Chamber

The room near the kitchen is jammed full of barrels of ale and mead, boxes, sacks, hampers, and wheels of cheese. Overhead hang smoked sides of meat, smoked fish, strings of sausages, and the like. There are smaller boxes of salt, and a screw-top copper container filled with spices (wonderfully hot peppers). Tuns of wine and casks of beer are kept handy near the door. The most common item, heaps of hard bread, is everywhere.

## 17. Guest Chamber

The doors to this room are closed on the outside by a great bar, because King Snurre does not fully trust his guest, a rakshasa, that resides herein. Naturally, most adventurers will assume a creature thus imprisoned might become a trusted associate-an attitude the rakshasa will encourage by taking some benign form (such as that of a fellow adventurer, a kindred soul, who has been deprived of equipment) to gain the characters' confidence before it attacks.

Inside are four beds, a table and two chairs, two stools, and other furnishings including three chests and a footstool (in reality a treasure chest). Rugs and tapestries adorn the floor and walls, and flaming torches in sconces provide light.

### Treasure

The rakshasa carries 50 gp and two gems (worth 100 gp each). The disguised chest holds a jeweled scepter worth 1,000 gp, three potions (<wc-fetch type="item">potion of superior healing</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">potion of mind reading</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="spell">invulnerability</wc-fetch>), and five spell scrolls (<wc-fetch type="spell">zone of truth</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">true seeing</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">darkness</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">cure wounds</wc-fetch> cast at 4th level, and <wc-fetch type="spell">symbol</wc-fetch>).

## 18. Barracks

Currently two fire giant and two fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) are housed here. They typically lounge around sharpening weapons and telling lies about their amatory prowess.

The room has eight cots, four stools, and four hampers. Each cot is heaped with skins. The hampers contain the giants' personal gear. Pegs on the walls hold their bags and cloaks. There are five clubs, three axes, six spears, and eight shields scattered about, mostly along the north wall. The place is lit by flaming gas jets.

### Treasure

One of the clubs, noticeably lighter than the others, has been hollowed out to serve as a treasure cache. It holds 15 pp, 30 gp, 15 ep, 25 sp, 184 cp, and three 100 gp gems.

## 19. Servants' Quarters

This room currently holds four fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage). The others that live here are presently at work in the kitchen (**area 15**). This torch-lit chamber has seven cots, various pieces of smaller furniture, and pegs on the walls that hold garments and the like.

### Treasure

Each servant has a piece of silver jewelry worth 100 gp.

## 20. Communal Quarters

Three fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) care for six young fire giants (use the ogre statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) in this vast chamber. All have weapons (kids' toys for the youngsters) and will fight with enthusiasm.

There are three beds and six cots along the walls. In each wing is a bench, three chairs, six stools, a long table, and various boxes, hampers, and cupboards.

### Treasure

Each servant has a piece of silver jewelry worth 100 gp.

## 21. Entry Hall of the Kennels

Four hell hound scuffle and play just inside the doors. They are part of the pack at **area 22** and will flee thereto by the safest route if threatened.

## 22. Kennel Chamber

Four hell hound are here. If those in **area 21** are attacked and yelp for assistance, these beasts split into pairs and station themselves in the north and south ends of the open area, from where they spring to the aid of the others. The hell hounds love their handler at **area 23** and come to his rescue if he whistles.

The kennel contains no treasure, other than the hounds' prized bones (of interest only to other hell hounds).

## 23. Kennel Keeper's Quarters

Herein dwell the Keeper and his mate, two fire giant who will rush to the aid of their charges if they hear a commotion outside. Their chamber contains a large bed, a table, two chairs, a bench, a chest, a cabinet, three barrels (beer, mead, and ale), two buckets (his and hers), and a crate (holding dried meat for the hounds). Burning torches light the place. Pegs on the walls hold wearing apparel and the giants' bags. A shield, a battleaxe, and a javelin lean against the wall to the north. Hides and pelts decorate the floor and walls, and a number of skins and furs are heaped on the bed and the bench.

### Treasure

The second bucket has a false bottom, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. Beneath it are stored 20 pp and eight gems (worth 100 gp each).

The javelin leaning against the wall is actually a <wc-fetch type="item">javelin of lightning</wc-fetch>.

One of the six cloaks on the bench is a <wc-fetch type="item">hell hound cloak</wc-fetch>. Wrapped inside this cursed cloak is a <wc-fetch type="item">sword of vengeance</wc-fetch>. There are three other hell hound hides in the chamber (those of beloved departed pets), all quite normal.

## 24. Guardpost

A fire giant is on duty here at all times with four throwing rocks nearby. An iron cylinder hanging near the north wall is a gong to be sounded if intruders are seen.

## 25. Barracks

Two fire giant warriors and two fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) are lounging among the cots, chests, and other furniture that fill this place. Several pegs here and there hold cloaks, capes, shields, and four giants' bags. There are only worthless giant-sized items in the chests and other containers.

One warrior has a greatsword, and the other one fights with a human-sized <wc-fetch type="item">+2 greataxe</wc-fetch>. The weapon gives the giant a +13 bonus to hit and deals 22 (3d8+9) slashing damage. The room also has twenty-one throwing rocks, which all the giants will use if the opportunity presents itself.

### Treasure

The easternmost of the three pillars has a secret hatch (equivalent to a secret door) concealing a hollowed-out space that contains 800 gp and three pieces of gem-studded jewelry (worth 500 gp each).

## Second Level: General Features

The map shows the layout of the second level of the fire giant stronghold. The floors, walls, and ceilings throughout the area are of black, reddish-black, dark gray, and dull brown rock. In some places the stone has been hewn, but in others it appears to have been fused by heat.

### Ceilings

Passageways have vaulted ceilings 30 feet high. Caves, chambers, and rooms are 40 to 60 feet high.

### Doors

All doors are made of iron plates. A Medium or smaller creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to open any of the doors in this place due to their great size and weight. Doors stay open if left that way.

### Illumination

Light is provided by torches, braziers, natural gas jets, and molten lava.

### Locks

The hall contains numerous well-made locks. Someone using thieves' tools can pick a lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

### Secret Doors

Secret doors on this level are precisely crafted. Unless otherwise noted, it requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door.

### Random Encounters

On the second level of the fire giant stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d12. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- One fire giant and one fire giant servant (use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage)
- One troll escorting one hill giant, one stone giant, or one frost giant
- One troll with ten gnolls
- One drow mage with five wererats

![Fire L2 2-Players](adventure/TftYP/AtGFire-L2-2-Players.jpg)

## 1. Hall of the Dead

This dark hall contains twenty huge sarcophagi standing upright against the walls, and four even larger ones lying on the floor in the center of the chamber. Those four are made of stone, and the northern two have likeness of fire giants carved into their lids, while the southern two are blank.

Of the sarcophagi that line the walls, half are made of stone, six are crafted from bronze, two are brass, and two are iron. All of them bear likenesses of fire giant kings and queens.

Examination will reveal that each of these burial vaults contains only the remains of a king or a queen, moldering garments, a few corroded weapons, and similar worthless items (wererat grave robbers stole anything of value long ago).

### Secret Exit

The tunnel behind the secret door in the southeast corner is about 5 feet in diameter. It twists and turns so that any person using it will lose all sense of direction before exiting at **area 2** on map 6.7.

## 2. Ettin Guards' Chamber

Four ettin reside here when they are not on duty near the main entrance to the grand hall (level 1, **area 2**). Two are asleep, their weapons within easy reach, while the other two quite alert. The chamber has a rude table, a bench, two stools, and four cots. Torches light the place. Nine pegs on the walls hold clothing and six giants' bags.

### Treasure

In the northwest corner is a hamper with six sacks, each holding 600 cp (which is the ettins' accumulated pay).

## 3. Visitors' Chamber

The doors to the north open into a room that houses two stone giant who have been working for King Snurre as engineers. The room, lit by torches, contains four cots, a large table, other furnishings, and pegs that hold clothing and two giants' bags. Eleven throwing rocks are scattered on the floor. A haunch of meat rests on the table along with mugs and platters of tin.

### Treasure

Each giant has 250 gp and a gem (worth 100 gp).

## 4. Storage Room

This room, illuminated by four torches set in wall cressets, has been cleaned out to serve as quarters for four hill giant. If they survived or escaped the assault on the steading, Chief Nosnra and his wife are among the occupants.

If only ordinary hill giants are here, the room contains nothing more than four heaps of skins for bedding, a table, and two chests.

If Nosnra and Grutha are present, the place has two cots, two heaps of skins, a trunk, a chain, a table, and two chests.

### Treasure

Ordinary hill giants carry 100 gp each but have no other treasure. The chief, if present, will have brought along whatever of his valuables he could salvage and carry here.

## 5. Community Quarters

In this large area are housed a fire giant warrior, three fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage), and four young fire giants (use the ogre statistics, plus immunity to fire damage). All are armed with various weapons, even the young, and there are twenty throwing rocks in the chamber.

The place holds several beds, two large cabinets, two tables, miscellaneous smaller furniture, a crate, and three small boxes. Lit torches are set along on the walls, as well as pegs that hold clothing and four giants' bags. Bits of gear, eating utensils, and odds and ends are scattered about the place too.

### Treasure

The fire giant warrior has 200 gp in his bag, and the other three adults have 100 gp each hidden in their personal effects.

## 6. Smithy

As the characters approach the natural cavern on the west side of the stronghold, they hear an intermittent hammering sound, made by a metallic object, coming from the other side of the opening. The hall outside this place is tinged a bloody red by the light emitted from the lava pool and the flaming gas jets that are found inside.

A knotty-limbed, burly fire giant, King Snurre's weaponsmith, is working here. He uses the molten lava to heat the items he works. With him are two troll that serve as his assistants. Currently in his forge, in various stages of completion, are three giant-sized swords, some pieces of armor, and several axe and spear heads.

### Treasure

The weaponsmith has in his possession a special <wc-fetch type="item">+2 mace</wc-fetch>, made of strange black metal, that he is doing some repair work on. If he is attacked and the fight goes against him, there is a 33 percent chance per round that he uses his action to toss the mace into the lava and destroy it, rather than let it fall into the hands of his enemies.

## 7. Torture Chamber

At the midpoint of the east-west corridor, steps lead down to the south, ending at a cluttered room with a 50-foot-high ceiling (which enables even very tall victims to be suspended on chains well above the floor). The stairway and the chamber are lit by torches, but the area is lightly obscured due to steam and murk.

The gloomy chamber contains a large (giant-sized) rack, a smaller (human-sized) one, an iron maiden (at the location marked A), and a stone-rimmed well (at the location marked B). Various chains, bats, irons, whips, ropes, wires, and the like are strewn about the place. A table, two chairs, a stool, and a large barrel of ale complete the picture.

Two fire giant, the King's Torturer and the Royal Headsman, are crouched in the center of the room, playing knucklebones on the floor with stakes of jewelry gems scattered in front of them. The headsman has his gigantic <wc-fetch type="item">+2 greataxe</wc-fetch> at hand-a weapon that can be employed only by a creature at least as strong and massive as he is. He has a +13 bonus to hit with the weapon, and it deals 28 (3d12+9) slashing damage on a hit. His friend the torturer has a greatsword nearby.

If the torturer is engaged in melee, he grapples his opponent and attempts to carry or throw the character into the iron maiden and slam it shut, dealing 55 (10d10) piercing damage to the unlucky victim. A victim can't open the iron maiden from within.

If the headsman is closely pressed, he grapples his opponent and tosses the character headfirst down the well. Anyone flung into the well falls 90 feet into an underground pool of water.

After the torturer uses the iron maiden, he begins tossing as many characters as possible down the well until the room is cleared of opponents. The headsman, by contrast, uses his axe after tossing one victim down the well.

### Treasure

The stakes of the game include six pieces of jewelry (worth 250 gp each) and ten gems (worth 50 gp each).

## Cell Complex

A number of small chambers are clustered around the center of this level of the stronghold. These rooms, labeled 1C through 14C, are cells meant to hold prisoners. In addition, the guardroom for the cell complex is marked with a G. Each cell has a thick wooden door with a high, barred window (about 15 feet up, too high for the average human to peek through without some climbing). Inside these rooms are rings set in the walls, chains attached to the rings, buckets, heaps of straw, and precious little else.

The occupants and other contents of the cells and the guardroom are as follows.

### Cell 1C

The female elf in this cell is destined for sacrifice in the Temple. She is a noble, and she promises that if she is rescued, she will send her rescuers a reward of 1,000 gp, twenty <wc-fetch type="item">+1 Arrow</wc-fetch>, an <wc-fetch type="item">arrow of slaying</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="item">cloak of elvenkind</wc-fetch>, and a pair of <wc-fetch type="item">boots of elvenkind</wc-fetch>. The reward will come to the characters a month or two after she is able to leave the stronghold and return home.

### Cell 2C

Eight male elf commoner are awaiting sacrifice in the Temple. They have no treasure, but they promise to sing their rescuers' praises.

### Cell 3C

A merchant is being held for ransom. He is a human commoner whose goods have all been seized by the giants, and thus he can pay his rescuers only with eternal gratitude.

### Cell 4C

The cell is empty. On the west wall is a secret door that opens only with a key held by the drow high priestess at **area 12**.

### Cell 5C

Two **noble centaurs** imprisoned here are bound for torture and execution. They offer help to any who free them.

### Cell 6C

The cell is empty.

### Cell 7C

Three gnoll being punished for insubordination were thrown in here. One is already dead from the after effects of torture; the other two will serve any rescuer who can tolerate their habits.

### Cell 8C

The cell is empty.

### Cell 9C

In this cell sits a troll that is used for torture practice from time to time. It is mindless and enraged, so it will attack instantly if given a chance. Otherwise, it remains motionless.

### Cell 10C

Seven gnoll caught stealing gold await their fate in this cell. They run away as fast as possible.

### Cell 11C

Two human skeletons lie on the floor, twined in each other's arms.

### Cell 12C

A female human assassin is chained to the wall. She cheerfully admits to being a thief who was caught trying to find the king's treasure room ("Know where it is?") and volunteers to aid the party faithfully in exchange for a chance to escape. Thereafter, if the opportunity presents itself, she will heist as much in gems and magic as she can and then slip away-but until then she will help the characters to the best of her ability (both to better her own chances of staying alive in this awful place and to win their trust). During this time she will be casing the characters to learn what they carry.

### Cell 13C

The king's chief lieutenant, a fire giant named Boldo, hangs in chains as punishment for failing to be properly deferential to Snurre. He will do anything to get back into Snurre's favor. Thus, he will happily lie to the party and tell them he is here because he tried to prevent Snurre from taking his current hostile course. If freed, he tells the characters, he can get several other fire giants to aid them in overthrowing the king and restoring the peace. In fact, Boldo will betray the party at his earliest opportunity. He is quite bright, and he will not be rash.

### Cell 14C

Chained in the cell next to the guardroom is an empyrean (of chaotic good alignment). It has been drugged and is effectively unconscious. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check can identify the effects of exposure to a virulent form of oil of taggit (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Magic, such as protection from poison or lesser restoration, can remove the poison from the empyrean's system. Otherwise, he recovers naturally in 12 hours. If awakened, he helps any party destroy the inhabitants of this place, although he would not mind seeing evil characters in the party die also.

### Guardroom (G)

One fire giant guard and three wererat in human form (appearing as female humans in tattered clothing) are conversing here by torchlight. The giant has two rocks nearby. In the room are a table, a chair, a stool, a bench, three kegs on the floor, and a small, covered jar on the table. The first keg holds small beer, the second one water, and the third one mead. The jar contains oil of taggit; anyone who opens the jar is exposed to the poison and has disadvantage on the saving throw. On the walls are pegs holding a giant's bag, a cape, a shield, keys to the cells, and a shirt.

If the guard is subdued and interrogated, he knows nothing of the secret tunnel to **area 8** (and thus does not volunteer that information). If the disguised wererats are conversed with, they claim to be captives forced to labor for the giants as scullions. If they are attacked, the wererats assume the form of giant rats and escape through a drain hole in the northwest corner of the room, traveling from there to alert the drow of intruders.

The secret door to the east opens into a passage about 2 feet wide and 1½ feet high. It is rough, and a human in armor could not hope to pass along its length; even a halfling would have to struggle to get through it.

### Treasure

A loose stone in the floor to the east of the door hides a cache of 30 ep, 60 gp, and 21 pp. The guard wears a gemmed brooch (worth 100 gp) on his cloak.

## 8. Secret Room

This place, pitch dark, is the lair of seven wererat. If the encounter is going badly for them, survivors flee down the northeast passageway to **area 15** on the third level (map 6.7) and warn the drow.

Aside from stolen cloaks piled here and there like nests, the chief features in this secret room are three heavy iron chests. All are locked, and each key is on a different wererat. The chests are also trapped with poison needles (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_). The poison on these needles is oil of taggit (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_).

The third chest the characters investigate is additionally trapped so that two poisoned darts fire upward from the inside when the lid is opened. Each dart has a range of 30 feet and a +8 bonus to hit. It deals 2 (1d4) piercing damage on a hit and subjects its victim to exposure to drow poison (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_). The mechanism for this trap is inside the chest, thus it cannot be detected from the outside. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check while beginning to open the lid notices that it opens stiffly, with resistance from the inside. Those near the chest have a brief moment of warning before the lid springs fully open and the darts shoot forth; anyone who ducks down or lunges away from the chest can avoid being hit.

### Treasure

The first chest holds six pieces of jewelry worth 250 gp each, eight pieces worth 500 gp each, and three large pouches stuffed with 100 gp each.

The second chest contains a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of poison</wc-fetch>, 800 gp (loose), and a cursed _scroll of protection_ (lycanthropes). Someone who reads the scroll must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become afflicted with wererat lycanthropy.

The third chest is empty, but a permanent invisibility spell covers writing on the inside of the lid. If the invisibility is dispelled, the information tells where a stone in the wall along the stairs down can be removed to reveal a <wc-fetch type="item">ring of shooting stars</wc-fetch>, a spell scroll of seven cleric spells (DM's choice), and a metal case holding six potions (<wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">potion of diminution</wc-fetch>, plus four more of the DM's choice).

A secret compartment in the lid of the box that contains the potions holds <wc-fetch type="item">pipes of the sewers</wc-fetch>. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check while examining the box finds the compartment.

## Temple of the Eye (Areas 9-11)

![Fire L1 2-Players](adventure/TftYP/AtGFire-L1-2-Players.jpg)

Illusionary walls (represented by dashed lines on the map) screen the temple area from discovery. Making physical contact with these images reveals their illusory nature. Someone who examines either image without touching it can determine that it is an illusion by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a successful check, the illusions fade for that character, becoming transparent enough to see through.

Beyond the illusions, the whole place is illuminated by a strange, swirling light that seems to be part of the very air. Eddies of luminosity drift here and there, causing the whole scene to be difficult to perceive. Distances and dimensions are tricky to determine in the shifting light of rusty purple motes and lavender rays. Globs of mauve and violet seem to seep and slide around. The ceiling of the temple is out of visual range, 50 feet high at its lowest point and well over 65 feet where it vaults upward in the center.

### 9. Giants' Worship Area

Each pillar radiates a sense of unease and insecurity in a 5-foot radius (simulate this by making players uneasy in whatever way you find best). The wall to the west is a mural showing giants bowing before a black cairn, offering sacrifices and giving gifts. The floor in the western half of the area is of porphyry, and the pillars are made of serpentine. Their well-polished surfaces reflect the strange light that permeates the place. The scenes on the west wall grow more gruesome as the viewer proceeds north, culminating in scenes showing human and giant sacrifice near the end closest to the altar (**area 11**).

### 10. Servants' and Thralls' Worship Area

The polished floor of red and black hornblende seems to flow between the thin pillars of obsidian that border this area. Each of these pillars radiates an aura of mild fear in a 2-foot radius, and if one is touched the creature who comes into contact with it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by a fear spell with the pillar as the object of its fear. Passing between two pillars causes a creature to take 5 (2d4) lightning damage, or double that if it is wearing metal armor.

The wall to the east shows a scene of various creatures submitting to a trio of huge, vaguely squid-like creatures, each with ten hairy tentacles and mottled in various shades and tints of purple and violet. In the forefront of this mass self-sacrifice are elves and humans, but there are also dwarves, gnolls, orcs, trolls, halflings, ogres, goblins, and other creatures among the crowd. Those near the front of the line are being torn apart and the bloody gobbets eaten as dainty morsels.

### 11. Priests' Area

The northern end of the temple is tiered, with three low steps that lead up toward the center of the north wall. This wall, made of cloudy purple stone, displays an inlay of a huge inverted triangle with a Y shape enclosed in it and touching the triangle's sides. Hanging beneath this symbol, suspended on chains from the ceiling, is a black metal triangle and cylinder.

The floor of the first tier is black stone shot through with veins of violet. A great drum of blackened skin and chitinous material rests on the western side of the first tier. On the eastern side is a rack from which hang nine silver cylinders, apparently a set of chimes. (these chime tubes are hollow and are worth 100 gp each).

The large pillar to the east on the first tier is made of malachite and is covered with graven signs and sigils. A casting of detect magic reveals that the glyphs radiate an aura of conjuration magic. If the correct pair of gylphs are touched, the creature touching them will be transported to **area 18** on the third level. You should devise the twenty-four glyphs upon this pillar and select which two are the trigger mechanism.

The second tier is dark gray stone, with specks of lilac and orange and purple. It holds a huge stone altar block of dull, porous-looking, somewhat rust-colored black mineral. To either side of the altar are large bronze braziers whose corroded green coloration is particularly nauseating in this setting. Flanking the braziers, in the form of triangles pointing downward, are two sets of candelabra, each candelabrum having three branches. These are made of bronze that is green with age, and each branch holds a fat black candle that burns with a flame of leaping lavender and deep glowing purple but never grows shorter.

The third tier is dull black stone with whorls of plum and lavender and splotches of red. The metal triangle stands upon the third tier. If the altar stone is touched by living flesh or hit by a weapon (or any object), it begins to fade in color, and in 3 rounds becomes a translucent amethyst color with a black, amorphous center. A creature that touches or strikes the altar when it is in this form must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 hour.

If the drum on the first tier is beaten, the chimes are rung, and the triangle is struck while the altar is in this translucent state, a glowing golden eye swims into view in the stone's writhing center. For each creature that sees the eye, roll a d12 and consult the following table. The creature is affected as if by a symbol spell of the indicated type (save DC 15).

### Glowing Eye

| <span class="text-center block">d12</span> | Symbol Spell Effect |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1</span> | Death |
| <span class="text-center block">2</span> | Discord |
| <span class="text-center block">5</span> | Insanity |
| <span class="text-center block">4</span> | Hopelessness |
| <span class="text-center block">3</span> | Fear |
| <span class="text-center block">6-12</span> | Looked away in Time |

Except for the death effect, these effects are curses and can be removed only as such.

If the three tentacle rods from **area 12** are in the characters' possession when the eye appears, and the braziers remain lit, then the altar becomes a means of summoning an Elder Elemental God-it turns a transparent heliotrope in color, the black mass at the center grows larger and shows swollen veins of purple, and the eye is a fiery red-orange. Then a tentacle comes out of the altar and grabs the nearest living creature. The tentacle has a reach of 20 feet and a +11 bonus to hit. A creature hit by the tentacle is drawn into the stone-totally gone, destroyed.

If a creature is drawn into the altar, the altar returns to its dormant state, and atop it will be the thing most wished for by the party-or something that will enable the characters to attain the end or state they most desire.

If a second summoning of this Elder Elemental God is attempted within the same day, roll a d12 and apply the indicated result from the table below.

### Tentacle

| <span class="text-center block">d12</span> | Horrible thing |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1</span> | Tentacles try to seize and devour 1d4 more creatures within the minute, but entity does not grant any additional desires. |
| <span class="text-center block">4-12</span> | Entity ignores the whole thing. |
| <span class="text-center block">3</span> | Entity raises one ability score of each character present by 1 point and takes no sacrifice. |
| <span class="text-center block">2</span> | Entity strikes everyone present permanently blind and does not grant any additional desires. |

### Treasure

The only items of value in the temple that can be salvaged are the silver chimes. Each hollow silver cylinder is worth 100 gp.

## 12. Drow Clerics' Area

The entrance to this chamber is protected by a wall of tentacles (not depicted on the map). It appears as rough brown-purple stone. This magic wall is like two ropers combined into one creature, giving it two bite attacks and eight tendrils that it can employ every round (though the tendrils have a range of only 20 feet). The wall has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. A casting of dispel magic deals the wall 50 damage, and disintegrate deals it 100 damage.

Drow can freely pass through the wall. If any other creature touches it, the wall attacks and emits a hissing and champing noise to alert the occupants of the chamber beyond it. If its current hit points drop to half its hit point maximum or lower, the wall casts <wc-fetch type="spell">darkness</wc-fetch> on itself (affecting only the outside of the wall, not its inner surface).

The chamber south of the wall is lit by the same everburning black candles that are found in the temple (**area 11**), so the illumination is eerie and dim. The walls are hung with purple cloth, and the floor is thickly carpeted in black. The inner room to the east is screened off from the outer room by a brocaded hanging of black with orange, gold, lilac, and mauve.

### Outer Chamber

The antechamber is the quarters of a drow elite warrior and a drow mage who assist their priestess, Eclavdra. Each has a tentacle rod in addition to its usual gear and weaponry.

A smoldering copper brazier near the door gives off an incense-like smoke that is sweet, cloying, decayed-smelling, disgusting, alluring, and euphoric all at once. In the candlelit room are two low black couches, each inlaid with silver. To one side sit a round table and two armchairs. At the foot of each couch is a low table with a basin and ewer made of jasper. Small stools and enameled coffers provide a bit of decoration.

### Treasure

The jasper basins and ewers are worth 300 gp per set. The first coffer examined holds a spell scroll of <wc-fetch type="spell">word of recall</wc-fetch> and three bars of adamantine, each weighing 5 pounds and worth 500 gp each. The second coffer contains 100 cp, 100 sp, 10 ep, 20 gp, and 10 pp, each type of coin in its own black leather pouch, as well as a pouch of ten gems (worth 50 gp each).

### Inner Chamber

The inner room, lavishly furnished and decorated, is the sanctuary of Eclavdra, the drow priestess of Lolth who has fomented all the trouble with the giants. Like her assistants, she also carries a tentacle rod in addition to her other equipment.

![Drow Priestess](adventure/TftYP/AtGDrow-Priestess.jpg)

Here the light from candles is supplemented by two small braziers of black and silver. Tapestries of a suggestive nature adorn the walls. The furnishings include a large bed, two small tables, three coffers, a buffet, a cabinet, a large wardrobe, two divans with a low chest between them, a dressing table and chair, a large mirror, two hampers, and two chests. All furnishings are of ebony or black stone, and most have silver inlay. The wardrobe holds feminine clothing and the priestess's vestments of mauve, black, and plum, stitched with gold.

A small screen of ebony inlaid with amber (weighing 10 pounds and worth 150 gp) sets off a dressing area in the southeast corner near the wardrobe, where a lowbacked chair stands with a gown thrown over it. This screen effectively hides the location of the secret door, which enables the priestess to slip in and out unseen.

### Treasure

Many of the items in Eclavdra's chamber are of significant value.

The priestess's ceremonial garment is set with ten violet garnets (worth 50 gp each), ten topazes (50 gp each), ten black opals (100 gp each), and ten amethysts (100 gp each); it is covered with a plain black wrapper to protect it from dust and damage.

A coffer on the low chest between the divans has a glyph of warding on the inside of the lid, so if anyone other than Eclavdra opens it, the glyph casts insect plague (spell save DC 14). The container holds three spell scrolls (<wc-fetch type="spell">gate</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">divine word</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="spell">greater restoration</wc-fetch>).

A coffer near her bed contains six potions: <wc-fetch type="item">potion of poison</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">potion of mind control (monster)</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">potion of growth</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">potion of heroism</wc-fetch>, and two <wc-fetch type="item">philter of love</wc-fetch>.

On the dressing table are two combs, a brush, four pins, and ten jars that hold unguents and cosmetics. These items are of onyx and silver, set with tiny gems. Each is worth 50 gp.

Beside her bed on a small table are a basin, a ewer, and a goblet made from lapis lazuli (each is worth 500 gp). The ebony-and-amber screen around the dressing area weighs 10 pounds and is worth 150 gp. The large mirror of silver is worth 50 gp

## 13. Guest Chamber

If Jarl Grugnur and his lady, Estia, survived the assault on the glacial rift, they will be sequestered in this chamber, accompanied by a frost giant that serves as a door guard. If the jarl and his lady are not present, the room contains two frost giants, recently arrived messengers.

The place is dimly lit by a few torches. It holds eight cots, a long table, two benches, two chairs, three stools, two buckets, six chests, a large box, and a cabinet. Hides on the floors and pelts on the cots help to make this place more comfortable and familiar for frost giant guests. Pegs hold clothing and three giants' bags.

### Treasure

Each giant carries 100 gp. In addition, the jarl and his lady will have whatever loot they managed to salvage from their stronghold.

## 14. Guest Chamber

Two cloud giant, a noble and his traveling companion, have come to hear from King Snurre why his warfare will profit them and make them more powerful. The giants have two lions serving as watch-animals at the door. The noble has a chain mail coat (AC 16), and both have their great morningstars and throwing rocks nearby.

The chamber contains two very large beds, two wardrobes, two small tables, a large table, two chairs, two stools, two buckets, a cabinet, a bench, and four chests. The place is illuminated by torchlight, and there are tapestries on the walls, rugs and hides on the floor, and furs on the beds.

### Treasure

On the small table near the bed to the south is a platinum box set with moonstones and sunstones (worth 1,000 gp) that holds ten gems (worth 100 gp each), which are a present to the visitors from the king.

## 15. Trolls' Chamber

Six troll guards nest in this room. Two of them keep watch in the northern passage (within the area marked by Xs) and two others do the same in the southern passage. The other two monsters are in the central chamber. Dozens of various polearms, morningstars, and swords lie heaped in the middle of the room. (These are used to arm the gnolls currently penned in areas 16 and 17.)

### Treasure

Each troll has a nest of sticks, bones, hide and skin scraps, and other nauseating material in which is hidden 50 gp.

## 16. Thrall Pen

Sixteen unarmed gnoll dwell here. Each has nothing but a heap of straw and a hide coverlet. Although these creatures are slaves of the giants, they identify with their masters' cause and will never help humans for any reason-in fact, they will gladly take up arms to fight intruders if given the chance.

## 17. Thrall Pen

Ten unarmed gnoll dwell here. They will behave in all respects like their kin in **area 16**.

## Third Level: General Features

The map shows the layout of the lowest level of the fire giant stronghold. This place is entirely natural, the tunnels and caverns showing no marks of being hollowed out, except for the entranceway to the level from above and around the exit beyond the River of Lava. As is usual with natural areas, do not worry overmuch about describing direction of passages and walls of caves and caverns, let alone size and shape. Primitive mapping techniques under stress conditions would develop just about the same sort of chart as your players will when their characters explore this level... wretched, but sufficient to get from place to place. If they have made it this far, they do not need any help from the DM!

### Ceilings

All passages are at least 20 feet high, small caves being 25 feet or so from floor to ceiling vault and large caverns anywhere from 25 to 75 feet high (areas 7, 19, and 20 are among the highest).

### Illumination

Most areas here are dark and still; only a few are lit, such as the lava cavern (areas 19 and 20) and the giants' final refuge in a crisis (**area 5**). If you like, add a few patches of phosphorescent growth as dungeon dressing-the light making it possible to see movement across it but not sufficient to illuminate an area.

### Sounds

If the characters were to remain still, they might hear water dripping, and perhaps once and once only a far distant echoing of stone striking stone.

### Random Encounters

On the third level of the fire giant stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d12. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- Two wandering trolls
- A fire giant patrolling with two hell hounds
- One drow elite warrior and three drow that use stealth to remain undetected and avoid confrontation

### Locations on the Third Level

#### Maps

![Fire Level Three DM](adventure/TftYP/AtGFire-Level-Three-DM.jpg)

![Fire L3 Players](adventure/TftYP/AtGFire-L3-Players.jpg)

## 1. Cavern

This cavern is fairly colorful, having many reddish, pale yellow, and shining blue-gray rock formations that glisten in the light of torches or lanterns. Three roper dwell here and conceal themselves among the natural stalagmite formations. They wait until prey approaches the center of the area before attacking.

### Treasure

Each roper has one gem (worth 100 gp) in its internal digestive organ.

## 2. Glowing Cave

This small offshoot of the larger cavern that runs north and south is filled with luminous plant growth and contains twelve hungry giant fire beetle. Some will be on the ceiling and drop upon any creatures entering their lair. These creatures served as a source of gifts for the frost giants in the past. They have no treasure.

## 3. Cavern End

The long cavern hooks eastward and terminates. Near the dead-end wall is an abandoned subterranean lizard's nest that contains several dozen shiny rocks (but none of value).

## 4. Cave

Four hell hound are on guard here, immediately giving voice if they detect any intruders.

## 5. Cavern

Two fire giant are stationed here as a reserve on Snurre's order (acting on instructions from the drow, of course). One rests in the northeast end while the other keeps watch, patrolling between the spots marked G. Each has several rocks nearby for throwing. They have a typical giant's bag apiece, and the room also has piles of hides for bedding, a hamper or two, and some personal gear.

In a crisis situation, this is where King Snurre, Queen Frupy, Obmi, and other important fire giants and guests will retreat to, along with whatever valuables they can salvage.

## 6. Great Vaulted Cavern

In the middle of this place is a permanent illusion of a huge red dragon dozing atop a mound of treasure (appearing like **area 7**, below). What is actually in that spot is a gorgon that obeys drow and has been instructed to ignore the presence of such creatures as hell hounds and fire giants and trolls. If any other kind of creature speaks to it from a distance in Common or Draconic, it has been instructed to stand quietly but then to breathe upon intruders as soon as they are within range. The illusion disappears once the gorgon attacks.

## 7. Treasure Trove Cave

This room is actually an extradimensional space, ten times larger than shown on the map. Anyone entering will notice first the enormous pile of treasure that fills the central part of the area and second the adult red dragon sleeping upon it.

Brazzemal is the dragon's name. If the boulder across the entrance is moved, requiring the strength of a fire giant, he will certainly awaken. He will not immediately reveal that he is aware of intruders, preferring to wait until they are at the edge of his breath weapon's range before addressing them.

Brazzemal is persuasive and deceitful, and his real desire will be to slay and devour the party and take their treasures to add to his already considerable hoard. Few adventurers ever face a dragon of his size in battle and live to tell about it; make sure that players and characters are well aware that they face a truly terrifying foe. Characters who are suitably flattering and ransom themselves by handing over the bulk of their wealth and magic items may be allowed to withdraw.

If the dragon is cornered and in desperate straits, he will swear to anything in order to save his life, but his information is not to be trusted (although he will word things in such a way as to avoid uttering any magically detectable lie).

### Treasure

Brazzemal's hoard is an enormous heap, most of its volume consisting of loose coins. All the best treasures are buried, and a thorough search through the pile will take a very long time. It contains:

- 69,830 cp
- 34,600 sp
- 1,870 ep
- 9,240 gp
- 200 pp in a malachite box that is itself worth 100 gp
- Twenty-three loose gems worth 10 gp each
- Five gems worth 100 gp each in a gold-chased silver egg (the two halves unscrew) that is itself worth 100 gp
- Twelve pieces of assorted jewelry worth 100 gp each
- Five jeweled weapons, human-sized, worth 200 gp each
- Two silver mirrors worth 50 gp each)
- A ten-piece gold service worth 150 gp per piece
- Ten ivory statues with inlays of gems and precious metals worth 200 gp each
- Four jade carvings and figurines worth 500 gp each inside a small chest
- An idol carved of bloodstone worth 200 gp
- Seven spell scrolls of wizard spells (DM's choice) in a crystal casket worth 500 gp
- A <wc-fetch type="item">dragon slayer</wc-fetch> (DM's choice of sword type) in a jeweled scabbard worth 500 gp
- A <wc-fetch type="item">brazier of commanding fire elementals</wc-fetch>
- Four _potions of resistance_ (fire) in a coffer
- Eight jars of rare unguents and perfumes worth 100 gp each
- A suit of <wc-fetch type="item">+2 armor</wc-fetch>, sized for a human (DM's choice of armor type)

In addition, Brazzemal has six hundred sixty-six gems (worth 1 gp each) pressed into his stomach to protect it. Destructive magical attacks against the dragon will certainly destroy from 60 percent to 90 percent of these gems as well as wreaking havoc with the hoard as a whole.

## 8. Cave

This is a drow guardroom, currently housing three drow elite warrior and six drow. All are clothed in black capes, shod with soft boots of black hide, and wear hoods over their helmets. Two sentries are on duty at all times near the entrance. The room holds only bedrolls and some miscellaneous gear.

### Treasure

Each elite warrior carries 40 pp, and each other drow carries 5 pp.

## 9. Wide Passage

Twelve piercer make their home in a cul de sac, where they patiently await unwary prey. The floor of the place is strewn with shattered skulls and bones.

### Treasure

Amid the gleaming white remains lies a gold necklace set with five gems (worth 250 gp in total).

## 10. Singing Chamber

This small place has excellent acoustics, and the drops of water falling into the pool along the southern portion of the wall make a faint, pleasant musical sound that can be heard for 120 feet in silence (or from 60 feet away in normal conditions). The pool's edge is lined by a huge patch of gray ooze, and another lies along a ledge 11 feet high in the southeast of the place.

## Stinking Caverns (Areas 11-13)

The large spaces along the southern side of this level are inhabited by troll servants of King Snurre. The stink that comes from these creatures, their nests, and the offal and remnants of rotted meat they leave about is noticeable from as far away as the head of the corridor that leads southwest from near **area 9**.

These caverns are very dangerous. If the trolls hear suspicious noises, or if any of them are assaulted, they split up to use the multiple passages in these areas to surprise and surround their attackers, leaping out of the darkness to tear them to shreds. An assault from nine trolls is nothing to sneeze at, even for a high-level party.

### Treasure

Each troll's nest holds about 1,000 gp worth of mixed coins. The nest of the large troll in area 13 also contains fifteen gems worth 100 gp each and a jeweled mace worth 500 gp.

### 11. Troll Annex

Three troll lounge herein, each with the typical messy mound of sticks and bones and other noisome things.

### 12. Troll Central

Two troll. This room, and its inhabitants, are much the same as those in area 11.

### 13. Troll Heaven

Four troll, including a dominant one that is particularly large (120 hit points), reside here. Conditions are similar to those in areas 11 and 12, except even more noisome.

## 14. Narrow Cavern

The corridor leading north from the troll dens is striated with layers of blue and green and greenish-blue deposits and streaks. Patches of **green slime** (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_) grow on the roof of the passage and in the pool of water at its end. The slime on the ceiling covers an area about 40 feet wide just south of the pool. The pool holds thirty-six agates (worth 10 gp each), which sparkle in the presence of any light-source. Any creature that reaches in to get these stones is 50 percent likely to blunder into the slime in the pool, which blends in with the greenish rock.

## 15. Gray Cavern

This dark-walled place is the drow strong point, and a drow watches each of the six routes that meet at this cavern. Four more drow are stationed in the chamber itself, for a total of ten.

In addition, the eastern alcove serves as a field headquarters for two drow elite warrior (the female is in command) and a drow mage. Near this alcove, a narrow passage leads east and then south, ending at a set of rough-hewn stairs that ascend to the second level, emerging near **area 8**.

### Treasure

The warriors and the mage carry 40 pp apiece, and each drow has 5 pp.

## 16. Small Cavern

The arrows to the north of the entry passage on the map mark the location of a trap. A character must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a tripwire made of fine spidersilk that is stretched across the entrance of the cavern. If an intruder steps on the wire, the act triggers a torrent of small iron spheres, each ¼ inch in diameter, that pour out of hidden containers on the eastern wall. These little spheres coat the floor in the final 40 feet of the passageway and the first 20 feet of the cavern itself.

If they fall, the iron balls make a loud noise, and any creature moving across the affected area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that moves through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.

There are nine female drow in the place. Five are normal drow, and three others are drow elite warrior. These eight guards protect Nedylene, a drow priestess of Lolth who is opposed to anything Eclavdra attempts. She is here to check up on her rival, and she will be suspicious of any creature entering her current abode. On the other hand, she will not be averse to seeing her rival's plans go wrong, so negotiation is a possibility.

Nedylene wields a <wc-fetch type="item">+2 whip</wc-fetch> and carries a <wc-fetch type="item">staff of swarming insects</wc-fetch> in addition to her other gear

## 17. Jeweled Cavern

If light strikes the walls of this cavern, mineral deposits make the place glitter and sparkle as if it were sown with jewels. This breathtakingly beautiful place is the current lair of two mind flayer who have decided to see what is going on with their friendly enemies, the drow. They plan to observe events, and the dark elves ignore them.

### Treasure

Each mind flayer carries 250 gp (bribe money), and they have a <wc-fetch type="item">tome of clear thought</wc-fetch> in a black metal box that can be opened only by a creature that has Intelligence 18 or higher.

## 18. Small Cavern

The cave at the end of the passage to the northeast is another drow guardroom, with occupants and contents identical to **area 8**: three drow elite warrior and six drow, two of which are on duty at all times near the entrance.

### Treasure

Each elite warrior carries 40 pp, and each other drow carries 5 pp.

## 19. Salamander Central

The huge cavern in the northwest corner of this level is lit up in reddish light from the bubbling, steaming river of molten lava that flows through the place. The cavern stinks of sulfur and heated rock, and the temperature here is very hot, although a strong draft cools it somewhat. The roof is no less than 60 feet high.

A rope bridge is suspended about 15 feet above the lava river, offering safe access to the northern chamber (**area 20**). The ropes have been specially treated to keep them from bursting into flame. A creature that comes within 10 feet of the lava for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn within 10 feet of the lava, takes 11 (2d10) fire damage. A creature that enters or touches the lava for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn in the lava, takes 33 (6d10) fire damage.

Amid this vaporous inferno in the area to the southeast are two salamander enjoying a change of clime. The flames and smoke render the area lightly obscured. The salamanders are totally indifferent with respect to whom they attack, although they know and respect the drow.

## 20. Council Chamber and Drow HQ

The secluded section of the cavern to the north serves as the meeting place and council chamber for Eclavdra and her minions. If things have gone badly for the drow and Eclavdra has escaped, she will be here with any surviving followers.

A constant watch is kept on the east entry to the cavern-if intruders come, the dark elves will know of it. If threatened by powerful characters, the drow will cut the rope bridge, then flee to safety back along the passage to the north-northwest (at the location marked A), descending deep into the Underdark.

Currently in this place (at the least) are six drow and four drow elite warrior, one of which is a female commander who has 110 hit points. The commander has a <wc-fetch type="item">+2 shortsword</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="item">+1 hand crossbow</wc-fetch>, and three magic bolts, as follows:

- A _bolt of holding_, which casts <wc-fetch type="spell">hold person</wc-fetch> on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets within 30 feet of that target
- A _bolt of blinding_, which casts <wc-fetch type="spell">blindness/deafness</wc-fetch> to blind on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets within 30 feet of that target
- A _bolt of vapors_, which casts <wc-fetch type="spell">stinking cloud</wc-fetch> centered on the point it hits

Each of these effects has a spell save DC of 15 and a duration of 1 minute.

### Treasure

In addition to bedding and a small amount of personal gear, a chest holding 200 pp and ten gems worth 100 gp each is hidden behind a rock formation in the far northeastern corner of the place. (Anyone who looks there will find the chest.)

The commander has a small coffer that contains two <wc-fetch type="item">potion of speed</wc-fetch> and two <wc-fetch type="item">potion of superior healing</wc-fetch>. These will be used by the drow if necessary (and if she is able to dispense them).

## Pursuing the Drow

A pair of hoists-derrick-like machines with straps strong enough to hold cargo of any sort (even giants!)- are tucked into nooks on either side of the river of lava. If any of the dark elves escape and the characters want to follow them, they can use these hoists to transport their possessions over the lava. It will take several hours to set the devices into working position, but thereafter characters will be able to move supplies and pack animals across the river and begin their pursuit of the drow.

If the characters choose not to chase the dark elves, assume that the drow collapse the tunnel behind them, sealing off the Underdark and ending the threat of coordinated giant attacks thereafter. In any case, surviving characters are to be congratulated on the success of their mission.
