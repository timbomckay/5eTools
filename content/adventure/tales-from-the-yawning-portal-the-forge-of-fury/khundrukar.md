}

Once the party enters Khundrukar, start at the appropriate area on map, the Mountain Door, or map, the Glitterhame.

### Khundrukar: General Features

The following aspects of Khundrukar are true unless otherwise noted in a particular area description.

#### Doors

Most doors are made of wood or stone. Characters can attempt various tasks before trying to open a door, including listening for sounds from the other side and checking for traps. If characters elect to listen at a door, check the description of the room beyond to determine if any creatures inhabit that area. If no instructions are otherwise provided, a character who listens at a door and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear sounds of activity through the door; increase the DC to 15 for quieter sounds.

#### Light

Within the confines of Khundrukar, all areas are dark unless a room's description says otherwise.

#### Ventilation

All keyed areas contain an adequate air supply. The air is renewed through vents that lead to the surface. These vents are individually too small for any but Tiny creatures to navigate.

### The Mountain Door

The uppermost level of Khundrukar, called the Mountain Door, is a natural cavern that was expanded and improved upon by Durgeddin's folk, who created a series of halls and guard chambers that protect the entrance to their realm. The place is still well fortified, even to this day.

This former dwarven strongpoint is now occupied by a band of orc raiders, led by a fierce ogre who calls himself Great Ulfe. These raiders emerge from the Mountain Door to hunt and pillage in the surrounding area. To keep their lair secure, the orcs have blocked access to the lower levels of Khundrukar, and they rarely encounter the other denizens of the cave system.

## 1. End of the Trail

The old dwarven path ascends to a cleft in the hillside and ends at the front door of Khundrukar.

![Mountain Door DM](adventure/TftYP/TFoFMountain-Door-DM.jpg)

![Mountain Door Players West](adventure/TftYP/TFoFMountain-Door-Players-West.jpg)

> The path climbs up one last steep switchback toward a bare shoulder of rock. The hillside rises steeply on your right and drops away precipitously on your left. Debris and rubbish lie scattered over the last hundred yards or so-discarded water skins, bits of charred bone, and splintered casks or kegs. Up ahead, the path opens onto a wide ledge and then doubles back sharply into the mountainside.
> 
> Two bestial humanoids in hide armor stand watch on the ledge. They appear inattentive and bored.

### Creatures

Two orc stand guard along the northern edge of the ledge, though they aren't paying as much attention to their duties as they should. The characters (or their advance scout) can spot them from as far as 60 feet away. The sentries, Wark and Thark, are grumbling in the Orc language about someone named Ulfe. Apply a -2 penalty to the orcs' passive Perception scores.

### Arrow Slits

When the characters move around the corner into the eastern part of the ledge, they might discover a row of hidden arrow slits in the rocky wall to the east about 15 feet above the floor. By examining the wall and making a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices the slits.

### Developments

If they are attacked or confronted by more than one character, Wark and Thark call out a warning that's heard by the orc in **area 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations** and then attempt to flee to **area 3**. See the "Mountain Door Defenses" sidebar.

If the archers are alerted to the party's presence, they open fire on intruders on the ledge and in **area 2**. See **area 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations** for more information.

## 2. The Dwarf-Door

Moving eastward from the ledge, the trail turns south and rises steeply through a cleft in the rock toward a grand entrance.

> Shallow steps lead up through a steep fissure to the south and turn east into the mountainside. Here, a broad entranceway has been carved out of the stone. Marble steps cracked with age and veined with green moss lead up to a strong double door of carved stone, eight feet wide and almost ten feet tall. Arrow slits high on the north and south walls command this area.

If the characters quietly dealt with the orcs in **area 1** using stealth or disguise, the door is open. Otherwise, the orcs have been alerted to intruders, and the door is shut and barred from the inside. Forcing open the barred door is very difficult, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check.

### Creatures

If the orcs have been alerted, the orcs in areas **4** and **4a** fire arrows until the characters either retreat or succeed in bypassing the door.

### Development

If the characters are repelled, they must deal with additional reinforcements if they try this approach again. Two orcs from area **11** stand watch at the doors on the west side of area **3**, while the orc Eye of Gruumsh from area **9** backs up the orcs in area **4** or **4a**.

### Mountain Door Defenses

The orcs are well prepared for a frontal assault on the Mountain Door. They follow the sequence of activity described below to the best of their ability unless prevented or interrupted by the player characters.

#### Round 1

After sounding the alarm, the sentries in **area 1** (Wark and Thark) flee south to **area 2**.

#### Round 2

The orcs in **area 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations** fire at any exposed characters in **area 1** if they have been alerted by the sentries. Wark and Thark flee through the door into **area 3**.

#### Round 3

Wark and Thark cross the rope bridge in **area 3**. The orcs in **area 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations** continue to fire at characters in areas 1 and 2. One orc from **area 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations** moves through the secret door leading to **area 3**, intending to close and bar the double doors leading to **area 2**.

#### Round 4

Wark and Thark slip through to **area 5** to spread the alarm, alerting the orcs in areas 11 and 14.

#### Round 5

The orc that shut the double doors in **area 3** moves to **area 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations** or 4a while the other archers continue to fire at exposed characters. The orcs in the eastern half of **area 3** cut the rope bridge and prepare to defend the doors that lead to **area 5**.

#### Round 8

The orcs in **area 14** arrive in **area 5**.

#### Round 12

Great Ulfe and the orcs from **area 11** move to **area 5** to ready a counterattack.

## 3. The Rift Hall

> The great door opens into a large hall. A narrow ledge overlooks a deep, dark crevasse that cuts the room in two. A dangerous-looking rope bridge, frayed and thin, spans the gap. Water gurgles and rushes somewhere far below. Two copper braziers burn brightly on either side of the door, illuminating the western half of the room. Another ledge is barely visible on the other side of the chasm.

The hall beyond the doors, and the great crevasse that runs through it, once served as the last line of defense for Khundrukar's dwarves.

![Rope Bridge](adventure/TftYP/TFoFRope-Bridge.jpg)

### Creatures

Two orc guard the eastern side of the room. They do everything in their power to prevent the characters from getting across the bridge. If any of the party members have darkvision or a means of illuminating the far side, read:

> Two brutish humanoids stand watch on the other side of the crevasse. They snarl a challenge, revealing yellowed tusks, and prepare to hurl javelins at you!

### Rope Bridge

The bridge is safe structurally, despite its appearance. Crossing under fire is difficult enough to require DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. On a successful check, a character can move at half speed. On a failed check, a character makes no progress. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character must make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the character plummets almost 200 feet to the underground river below and is swept away. The characters can prevent falls by roping themselves to a stable attachment point before crossing.

### Secret Doors

Two secret doors on the north and south walls lead to areas 4 and 4a. The doors are well made, each requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to discover. A door can be opened by simultaneously pushing in two concealed stone plates in the wall about 1 foot above it. The plates can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

### Developments

The orcs use the rock outcroppings on their side for shelter from attacks, gaining half cover. They throw their javelins at characters trying to cross the bridge, or at those who hang back to cast spells or make ranged attacks. A character on the bridge who is hit by an attack must make a saving throw to avoid a fall, just as if the character's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to move along the bridge had failed by 5 or more.

If an intruder gets at least two-thirds of the way across the bridge, one orc breaks cover to move through the double doors into **area 5** and get help. The other tries to hinder the characters by chopping at the bridge's support ropes with its greataxe. Each rope has 8 hit points and AC 11. If one support rope is cut, the DC of the Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cross the bridge increases to 12, and characters on the bridge must immediately make a saving throw to avoid falling as described above. If both ropes are cut, the east end of the bridge drops into the crevasse and slams into the cliff wall on the west side. Any characters on the bridge take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the impact with the wall and must make successful DC 12 Strength or Dexterity saving throws to avoid losing their grip and falling if they aren't otherwise secured.

### Development

If the orcs destroy the bridge but repel the invaders in doing so, Great Ulfe's followers rebuild it within three days. Any orcs killed here are replaced by orcs from **area 11**.

## 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations

The dwarves carved out chambers on either side of the entryway so they could rain arrows down on attackers that approached the front door of their stronghold. The arrow slits are 15 feet or more above the floor of areas 1 and 2 and are impassible for creatures larger than Tiny. They grant three-quarters cover to the orcs stationed behind them.

The secret doors in **area 3** provide access to these locations.

> The door slides aside to reveal a narrow passage that descends a flight of stairs into a small chamber. Light from outside slants into the room through a series of narrow embrasures.
> 
> The area is littered with well-gnawed bones, cobwebs, and rat droppings. Poorly cured hide blankets are carelessly scattered over the floor.

### Secret Door

In the north end of area 4, a secret door connects to **area 14**. A character can find the door by succeeding on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. The orcs are unaware of this passage and don't use it.

### Creatures

Four orc, three in area 4a and one in area 4, overlook the stairs leading up to **area 2**. These orcs aren't particularly vigilant, but they do start shooting if the sentries in **area 1** call for help. The orcs are armed with longbows instead of javelins: +3 to hit (range 150/600 ft.); 5 (1d8+1) piercing damage on a hit.

When the characters turn the corner into **area 2**, the archer in area 4a joins the attack while one of the archers from area 4 circles around through the secret door in an attempt to shut the double doors to **area 3** (see "Mountain Door Defenses," **area 3**).

If the heroes attack by coming through the secret doors that lead to these areas, the archers fire at characters descending the stairs, then switch to greataxes and move up to block the stairways.

### Development

If the characters dispose of the sentries in **area 1** quietly, the orcs in area 4 might not notice them. Characters can attempt to sneak past the row of arrow slits by comparing their Dexterity (Stealth) checks to the orcs' passive Perception scores. If the characters successfully sneak past the sentries, they reach **area 2** without alerting the archers.

If the characters defeat these orcs but withdraw from the dungeon before overcoming the rest of them, the archers are replaced by orcs from **area 14** and reinforced by the orc eye of Gruumsh from **area 9**.

## 5. Orc Cave

> The walls and floor of this natural cave have been carefully smoothed. You can discern at least four routes leading off into darkness. Red coals glow from within the southeastern passageway, and a crude wooden cage door closes off the southern exit. The floor is covered with sleeping furs, crates, sacks, and rubbish.

![Mountain Door Players East](adventure/TftYP/TFoFMountain-Door-Players-East.jpg)

The second orc raiding party normally lairs in the open area east of the doors. These orcs are currently out of the dungeon unless the party spent several days observing the hillside (see "Wait and Watch,") before entering.

### Cage Door

The cage door to the south leads to **area 6**, where two prisoners languish under the orcs' indifferent care. The prisoners leap to their feet and rush to the cage door to cry for help when the characters enter **area 5**.

### Treasure

The crates and sacks in this room contain mundane supplies looted from the countryside-flour, grain, nails, and so on. The total value is about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material. Additionally, if characters are held captive in **area 6**, their equipment is stored here.

### Development

When the second orc raiding party returns (five days after the characters arrive at the Stone Tooth), they take up residence here. Add four orcs to this room after their return.

## 6. Prisoner Cave

The orcs occasionally capture miners, settlers, and merchants traveling through the forests north of Blasingdell. They keep their captives in a small pen until they put them to death or ransom them.

> A row of rough-hewn sapling trunks forms a crude but serviceable barrier across the mouth of this small cave. A door locked with an iron padlock secures the room. Inside, you see two filthy prisoners dressed in tattered rags, crowding close to the door. "Thank Yondalla!" one cries out. "We're rescued!"

### Creatures

The prisoners are a pair of human commoner named Geradil and Courana. They hail from a small settlement a few miles from Blasingdell, and the orcs have held them captive for almost a month now. Neither one's family could raise the ransom demanded by their captors, so both await a terrible death at the orcs' hands.

Opening the cage door requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, the key from Old Yarrack's pocket (see **area 14**), or a sharp axe and a little time. (The padlock has AC 19 and 5 hit points.) Geradil and Courana are extremely grateful for their rescue, but they will not join the characters in their quest-neither is skilled at fighting, and they just want to go home.

### Treasure

The characters can free the prisoners and escort them back to their homes (about a day's travel away). The grateful families reward them with two <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>. Taking the time to see Geradil and Courana to safety, however, gives the orcs a chance to prepare for the next assault.

### Development

Any characters captured by the orcs eventually wind up in the cage, unless they demonstrate that they're too much trouble to be left alive. Their gear is stored among the other supplies in **area 5**. New characters joining the party might also be introduced as prisoners here.

## 7. Fire in the Hole

The irregular chamber southeast of the main cave holds the main cooking fire of the tribe. A crevice in its ceiling winds up through the rock to the natural chimney on the hilltop above (see "The Stone Tooth,").

![Mountain Door Players East](adventure/TftYP/TFoFMountain-Door-Players-East.jpg)

> A large, smoky fire crackles in the center of this room. Battered pots and kettles are stacked all over; clearly, this space serves as a crude kitchen. You feel a distinct draft drawing the smoke up through a rough hole in the ceiling.

The characters might attempt to descend into the area through the chimney. The shaft is about 80 feet long; its walls are irregular and rough but slippery, requiring successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to climb. Anchoring a rope at the top of the shaft reduces the check DC to 5. A careful climber can easily avoid the fire on the way down.

If a character's check fails by 5 or more, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall the rest of the way down the chimney. In addition to falling damage, the character takes an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage from the hot coals and makes enough noise to alert any orcs in **area 5**.

## 8. Orc Commons

> Haphazard stacks of crates, barrels, sacks, and bundles crowd this long cavern. To the north, two finished stone passageways open to the east and west; a narrower opening leads south. In the southeast corner is an old well full of murky water.

The cavern is full of plunder from the orcs' raids through the surrounding area: foodstuffs, ale, blankets, tools, timber, pitch, nails, wool, and similar goods.

### Iron Gate

The passage leading east is blocked about 10 feet in by tightly packed crates and sacks of flour. Removing this material allows travel for another 20 feet to the east, where the tunnel ends at an iron gate stuffed with blankets and straw pallets. The orcs created these barricades to prevent the stirges in **area 10** from getting out.

The iron gate's lock is rusted shut; it can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves' tools or forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

### Secret Doors

The passage to the south branches in a Y shape. The southwest branch connects to **area 5**, and the southeast one leads to a secret door cleverly constructed to blend into the natural rock of the cave. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers the door.

On the other side, a worked passage continues up to what appears to be a blank wall, marked with hexes and curses in Orc. The markings conceal another secret door, which requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.

### Treasure

The mundane supplies have a total value of about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material.

With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character finds a loose stone. Behind it is hidden a small locked strongbox containing 180 gp and a flask of holy water. This is the personal treasure of Old Yarrack (see **area 11**).

## 9. Shaman's Lair

> The secret door pivots open to reveal a chamber of finished stonework. The room is cluttered with crude furnishings, and the air is hazy with the smoke of a small cooking fire. Dozens of yellowed skulls are suspended from the ceiling by fraying ropes strung through holes punched in the bone. An orc in a ragged black robe looks up from her work, her face twisted in an expression of rage.

### Creatures

Burdug the shaman, an Orc Eye of Gruumsh, has commandeered a chamber as her private domain. She lives here with her two followers, female orc, separate from the rest of the tribe.

The door to **area 10** is locked, but the key is inserted in the keyhole on this side. Burdug keeps the door closed because she wants to confine the stirges on the other side. (She calls the stirges her "little stingies" and occasionally captures one to use in her potions and brews.)

Burdug orders her two followers to engage intruders while she attempts to neutralize a dangerous-looking combatant with a command spell. Then she casts <wc-fetch type="spell">bless</wc-fetch> on herself and the others, and finally casts <wc-fetch type="spell">spiritual weapon</wc-fetch> before joining battle.

If the fight goes poorly, Burdug throws alchemist's fire (she has three flasks) and opens the door to **area 10**, releasing the stirges. She takes advantage of the confusion, using more alchemist's fire if necessary, to escape and seek help.

### Treasure

A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds two leather sacks among the clutter, each containing 160 sp. If Burdug is defeated, the characters can recover any of her three flasks of alchemist's fire that weren't used.

### Secret Exit

A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to find the secret door on the west wall. It connects to the passage leading toward **area 8**; the secret door farther along the passage to the west isn't concealed from this side.

## 10. The Grand Stair

> The ceiling soars thirty feet high in the center of this impressive chamber, and the walls are carved with images of dwarves at their forges. Two large stone doors exit to the north and south. Several old skeletons lie scattered near the northern door. A gate of wrought iron stands in the western wall.
> 
> In the center of the floor, a natural rift descends sharply. Dozens of stone steps lead down into darkness. You can hear the distant sound of running water and a curious buzzing coming from far below.

The easternmost chamber in the Mountain Door complex formerly served as the main entrance to the Glitterhame, which occupies the great natural caverns deeper in the hillside.

### Creatures

If the characters aren't trying to be quiet, four hungry stirge attack.

> The buzzing grows louder, and then four things resembling insectoid bats emerge from the stairwell and fly toward you!

Large quantities of smoke discourage the stirges, and they don't move closer than 5 feet from a source of fire (including characters set alight by the trap described below). Sated stirges flap off to digest their meal down in **area 15a** of the Glitterhame.

The iron gate blocks entry from **area 8** (see it for more information). The stairs in the rift lead down to the northwest end of **area 15** in the Glitterhame.

The door to the south connects to **area 9** and is locked from the other side. The lock can be picked from this side by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, but doing so pushes the key out on the other side and warns Burdug the shaman that someone's coming.

### Fire Trap

The door to the north is carved in the image of a glowering dwarf's face. Hinges are visible. On either side of the door, eight small spouts are carefully worked into the stonework about 10 feet above the floor.

The skeletons near the door are those of orcs killed by the trap long ago; their remains show signs of severe scorching. Rusted axe heads lie near the bodies, with no sign of the weapons' hafts.

If the door is pulled open before the trap is disabled, a counterweight drops and pumps a flammable substance resembling alchemist's fire from the spouts. Each creature within 15 feet of the door takes 10 (4d4) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. At the start of each of its turns thereafter, an affected creature takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. A creature can fight the flames around itself by making a successful DC 10 Dexterity check as an action; a successful check reduces the fire damage it takes at the start of each of its turns to 2 (1d4). Making another successful Dexterity check as an action quenches the flames around the creature entirely.

After the door is opened, the counterweight pulls it shut again in 2 rounds, resetting the trap. The characters can prevent this from happening by jamming the door open. If the trap resets, it can be activated only once more before its fiery substance is depleted.

The spouts on the wall can be detected by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check afterward, a character deduces that they form part of a trap mechanism. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or someone who tightly plugs the holes with durable material, renders the trap inactive. Someone who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check while examining the door identifies the counterweight mechanism that activates the trap; it can be deactivated afterward by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

### Development

Inspecting the small room behind the door reveals the full extent of the trap's counterweight mechanism, as well as a system of pipes that connect the spouts to two 20-gallon copper drums (containing the substance for the fire trap).

A character who is proficient in the use of <wc-fetch type="item">alchemist's supplies</wc-fetch> might be able to craft alchemist's fire from the dregs of the tanks. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check after the character finishes a long rest. On a successful check, the character salvages 1d4 flasks of alchemist's fire. On a failed check, the reagents are mixed improperly, spoiling the batch; no further attempt to use these reagents can be made. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character is affected as though hit by alchemist's fire.

## 11. Orc Quarters

> Barrels, crates, and sacks line the walls of this chamber. Among the loot, four oversized straw pallets and other simple furnishings show that it now serves as a bunk room. Four bestial humanoids with feral eyes are cleaning their weapons and mending their gear; they spring to their feet and roar in challenge.

### Creatures

Four orc live in an old guardroom. These orcs fight dirty. They team up into pairs, each focusing on one character. One orc in the pair attempts to shove the character, then the other attacks, hoping for a prone target.

### Treasure

The supplies stockpiled here are the same as those in areas 5 and 8: trade goods and staples raided from travelers and nearby settlements.

The orcs have 210 gp stashed in an old iron cauldron under vermin-infested bedding. A small pouch in another orc's bedding contains a topaz worth 200 gp and two onyx stones worth 50 gp each. This loot isn't well hidden; anyone searching the room can uncover it.

### Development

If the characters leave the complex before they have defeated Great Ulfe, two of these orcs move to reinforce **area 2** (reducing the number in this room to two) before the characters return.

## 12. Great Ulfe

> A short flight of stairs leads up to a large, iron-bound door. A bloodstained human skull is fixed to the center of the door by an iron spike.

![Mountain Door Players West](adventure/TftYP/TFoFMountain-Door-Players-West.jpg)

The door isn't locked, but it is heavy and hard to move; a successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to force it open.

> Beyond the door lies a small chamber covered in poorly cured animal hides and illuminated by smoking torches in bronze sconces. The smell is indescribable. A monstrous creature about ten feet in height steps forward, a massive axe in one hand. Two huge wolves strain at chains held closely in its other hand. "You think to challenge the Great Ulfe?" the creature booms. "Vak! Thrag! At them!"
> 
> It drops the chains and, as the wolves spring forward, it charges at you with a roar of rage.

![Great Ulfe](adventure/TftYP/TFoFGreat-Ulfe.jpg)

### Creatures

Great Ulfe is a fierce ogre who leads the orcs of the Mountain Door. The chamber he claims as his own once belonged to the dwarf watch-captain.

If the characters fail to open the door on the first attempt, Great Ulfe is alerted to their presence. He releases his two dire wolf, Vak and Thrag, and takes the Ready action to attack the first enemy who enters the room. He is armed with a greataxe instead of a greatclub: +6 to hit; 17 (2d12+4) slashing damage on a hit.

Great Ulfe neither asks nor gives quarter, but if the ogre falls, the wolves attempt to flee.

### Development

If the characters defeat Great Ulfe but leave any orcs alive, one of the surviving orcs claims leadership of the tribe. If at least half the orcs in the tribe are slain in addition to Ulfe, any survivors abandon the dungeon after the party leaves. They become roving bands of raiders that the adventurers might have to deal with later.

### Treasure

Great Ulfe keeps his hoard in two large wooden chests against the south wall: 440 gp, 1,600 sp, a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of climbing</wc-fetch>, and a <wc-fetch type="item">+1 rapier</wc-fetch>. (The ogre would never stoop to wielding the delicate blade like some prancing bard.)

## 13. Dwarven Statue

> At the end of the passage stands a statue of a fierce-look ing dwarf in heavy mail armor. The stone warrior holds a sword in one hand and a smith's hammer in the other. The statue is about seven feet tall and stands on a large stone pedestal.

The statue is part of another trap designed to thwart invaders of the citadel. All the denizens of the Mountain Door know about the trap and avoid triggering it.

If any character approaches within 5 feet of the statue without disarming the trap, read:

> Suddenly, you feel a small click from the floor beneath your feet. The statue's bearded face slides open, like an oversized nutcracker, and greenish gas billows forth.

### Poison Gas Trap

A pressure plate is set into the floor about 5 feet in front of the statue. When at least 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, it depresses into the floor, opening the statue's face to reveal a nozzle from which poison gas sprays out in a 15-foot cone. Each affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the creature finishes a short rest.

Someone who examines the proper location and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the pressure plate. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves' tools disarms the trap; the pressure plate can also be deactivated by physically jamming it so that it can't move.

If the trap isn't deactivated, it resets automatically after 1 minute.

## 14. Bunk Room

A large chamber, once the principal bunk room for dwarf guards posted in this part of the dungeon, has been appropriated by Great Ulfe's orcs. Up to eleven of the creatures live here, but at the moment a group of them are out raiding the countryside nearby, and three others are on duty in **area 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations**.

> This chamber is filled with rough-hewn bunks, tables, and chairs, and the floor is strewn with filthy pelts. At first glance it appears that a dozen or so humanoids might use this area as a sleeping quarters.

### Creatures

Only Old Yarrack the orog and four orc are at home when the characters enter the chamber. They enter combat as soon as they're aware of intruders.

If the battle goes poorly for the orcs, Old Yarrack orders an orc to break off and summon help from **area 9**. If things get desperate, he sends for help from the orcs in **area 11**. If the orcs here fall, Yarrack attempts to join Great Ulfe's forces in **area 12**. The orog carries a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch> and drinks it if his current hit points drop to one-fourth his hit point maximum or lower.

### Secret Door

The orcs don't know about the secret door in the western wall, but a character who searches the spot can discover it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

### Development

Two days after the characters arrive, the first raiding party returns and reinforces this room with four more orcs. Thus, the party might encounter as many as nine creatures in this room.

Any orcs slain in **area 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations** are replaced by orcs from this room, if any survive.

### Treasure

A successful DC 10 Wisdom check reveals a loose stone on the south wall, concealing a sack that holds 250 sp and 40 gp. Aside from his <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>, Old Yarrack keeps his personal treasure in **area 8**.

Old Yarrack carries the key to the cage door in **area 6**.
