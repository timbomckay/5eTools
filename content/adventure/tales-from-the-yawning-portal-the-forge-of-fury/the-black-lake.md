The darkest and most remote corner of the Glitterhame's cavern system, the Black Lake is a large, winding cavern filled with water that drains from the Dark Mere through a submerged siphon. From the lake, the subterranean river flows west through the Sinkhole, across the bottom of the chasm in **area 3** of the Mountain Door, and onward for about 5 miles until it emerges at the surface.

The dwarves of Khundrukar never settled these caverns, although Durgeddin had his followers begin work on an escape route through the depths.

The Black Lake is now the domain of Nightscale, a young black dragon. Here she has built her hoard, having slowly collected most of the remaining loot from Khundrukar. From the lake, Nightscale can swim to the Sinkhole, climb up to the Glitterhame, or fly up to the Foundry through the chasm there. The troglodytes fear and worship the dragon. The duergar have negotiated an uneasy truce with Nightscale, paying her a modest tribute to leave them alone.

## 50. The Cascade

The stream in **area 38** flows over the edge of the chasm and pours down into a turbulent pool.

> A thundering spray of water fills this chamber, pooling and flowing out to join a larger river to the north. The air is damp, and the roar of the waterfall is deafening. A broad ledge heads north toward the river and then turns out of sight to the east. The muddy bank of the pool looks disturbed by tracks of some kind.

A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies the tracks as those of a Large reptilian creature with four feet and a long tail. The tracks lead away from the hard stone of the ledge to the north (where they can't be seen) and into the water.

## 51. Dwarven Bridges

Durgeddin's followers built two stone bridges when they started work on the escape route through this level. The chain ladder that drops from the north ledge of **area 38a** ends just above the ground in the area south of the western bridge.

If the characters reached this area by using the chain ladder or otherwise descending through the chasm, read or paraphrase the following text. Adjust the information as needed if they arrive here by a different route.

> A fast-moving underground river roars from east to west under a stone bridge. The bottom of the chain ladder is near the south bank of the river. On the north side of the bridge, a ledge continues to the east.

If the characters go north and cross the bridge, read:

> After a short distance, the ledge leading east bends to the south, and a second bridge surmounts the river.

The western bridge is safe, but the bridge to the east is not. It has settled considerably, some of its stone blocks leaning precariously. Also, the stone has a curiously pitted appearance (which was caused by Nightscale's acid breath). A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check can determine that the stone was affected by acid, although the source of the acid isn't apparent.

### Hazard

The weakened bridge can't take much weight before it collapses. If more than one Small or larger creature is on the bridge at one time, or if a character in heavy armor steps onto it, the arch fails. Any creature on the span must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to catch itself on the ledge. On a failed save, a creature falls, takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from falling timbers and stones, and is caught in the river's current (see "Fast-Flowing Water."

## 52. Nightscale's Lair

When the characters first approach the southeastern shore of the lake, Nightscale is dozing on her hoard on the island (**area 53**). The dragon is immediately alerted to their presence if the characters make noise, carry light sources, or trigger the collapse of the bridge. Otherwise, the characters don't draw the dragon's attention unless they move all the way to the ledge directly south of **area 53**.

> The dilapidated bridge leads to another ledge that winds southeast alongside a very large lake, apparently the source of the underground river. The cavern is quite large; the lake's far shore is lost in shadow, and the echoes of water seem to indicate a very sizable cave.

![Nightscale](adventure/TftYP/TFoFNightscale.jpg)

### Creature

When Nightscale becomes aware of intruders, the young black dragon slips into the water, quietly swimming to a point near the three stepping stones shown on the map. Any character watching the lake can make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the dragon's Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a successful check, the character catches a glimpse of a serpentine form moving in the darkness.

The dragon takes full advantage of her aquatic environment and never offers an easy target to enemies. She begins combat at a range of 20 to 30 feet, raising only her head and part of her neck above the water (granting her three-quarters cover) and breathing acid. Then she submerges and waits for her breath weapon to recharge. Nightscale doesn't resort to melee combat unless she is confronted underwater. If the dragon is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, she tries to escape through the passage in **area 54**.

### Negotiation

Nightscale isn't inclined to parley with the characters unless they surrender, give her all of their treasure, and throw their arms and armor in the lake. If the characters seriously injure her, Nightscale might bargain to buy time so she can later move her hoard. Only when she is near death does she abandon her treasure.

## 53. Nightscale's Hoard

When the characters come into view of the island for the first time, read:

> A short distance offshore sits a small isle thirty or forty feet across. Stalagmites thrust up at the ceiling above, and the dark waters lap quietly at its shores. Several spots on its surface glimmer even in the gloom, suggesting the promise of treasure to be had.

Nightscale keeps her treasure on the small island in the lake, and she spends most of her time resting here. If the characters have avoided attracting her attention so far and want to approach the island, they can do so quietly if every character's Dexterity (Stealth) check meets or exceeds the dragon's passive Perception score.

### Treasure

Nightscale has accumulated considerable wealth from her plunder of Khundrukar. Her hoard contains 6,200 sp, 1,430 gp, two garnets worth 20 gp each, a black pearl worth 50 gp, a <wc-fetch type="item">wand of magic missiles</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="item">+2 greataxe</wc-fetch> bearing Durgeddin's smith-mark, a <wc-fetch type="item">+1 shield</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>, and a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of flying</wc-fetch>.

## 54. The Dragon's Passage

Beneath the surface of a small pool is an underwater passage that links the Black Lake to the Dark Mere on the east side of the Stone Tooth. The submerged passage is about 700 feet long.

### Aftermath

The characters have overcome Khundrukar's dangerous inhabitants and looted the dragon's lair. What next?

#### Resolving the Character Hooks

If the characters return to Blasingdell, their fame as adventurers spreads. Townsfolk hail them on the street, and some might approach them with problems that can lead to further adventures. The characters can continue to use the town as a base of operations. Other developments depend on what got them here, and how they leave.

##### Follow the Map

While the characters are exploring the stronghold, they might find another map, perhaps ion the body of an adventurer from the previous expedition, or in the library in **area 49**. It could lead to a different dungeon, a city in some land far away, or an as-yet-unknown location rumored to hide fabulous treasure

##### Track the Broken Blade

If the characters were sent to retrieve weapons for Baron Althon, they can bring him the <wc-fetch type="item">+1 longsword</wc-fetch> from **area 22**, the <wc-fetch type="item">+2 greataxe</wc-fetch> in **area 53**, the <wc-fetch type="item">handaxe</wc-fetch> from are 14, and the <wc-fetch type="item">warhammer</wc-fetch> from are 23. All bear Durgeddin's smith-mark; Baron Althon pays 500 gp above the market price for each mundane weapon, 1,000 gp for the <wc-fetch type="item">+1 longsword</wc-fetch>, and 6,000 gp for the <wc-fetch type="item">+2 greataxe</wc-fetch>, if the characters are willing to sell.

##### Vanquish the Orc Raiders

The characters can return to Blasingdell at any time to collect the bounty for orcs they kill or capture. If the characters eliminate all the orcs in the stronghold, the mayor honors them with a celebration attended by the eminent citizens of the town. The characters have established valuable contacts who can aid them in their later endeavors

#### Further Adventures

You can build an entire campaign around the duergar that occupy the Foundry. Perhaps they came here from a hidden city in even deeper caverns beneath the Sinkhole and the Black Lake. Your answers to the following questions form the basis for further adventures:

- How did the duergar get into the complex?
- What is the mysterious project they are working on?
- Did Durgeddin know of the duergar's existance?
- Do the duergar have some of Durgeddin's items? If so, are they guarding them or using them?

You can also use this adventure to sow the seeds of the characters' next activity. Perhaps the party encounters a legend of a magical treasure from Khundrukar's fall, buried in the tomb of an evil knight. Maybe Great Ulfe's ogre clan is terrorizing a nearby area, or an orc war chief wields a legendary weapon that was crafted by Durgeddin.
