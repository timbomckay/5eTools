The stream that flows through the Glitterhame descends through the chasm in **area 25** to an even lower level of caverns-the Sinkhole. Here it joins a subterranean river that traverses dark caverns and forgotten storerooms before connecting with the Black Lake.

None of the monsters that inhabit the complex regularly visit this place. The black dragon Nightscale sometimes swims through its submerged areas, using the river as a back door to its lair.

A narrow staircase winds down along the chasm walls until reaching bottom, where it offers access to **area 28** (Waterfall Cavern).

## 28. Waterfall Cavern

> A loud waterfall spills down the northwest wall of this cavern into a deep pool. The rocky walls glisten with spray, and a weird array of colorful minerals and strange lichens lend an unearthly beauty to this spot. A fast-moving stream runs south from the pool at the base of the falls, and a nearby natural passage heads in the same direction. A set of narrow stairs cut into the rock wind up to the north, and two old wooden doors stand in a wall of dressed stone to the east.

The stream flowing from **area 25** in the Glitterhame pours down into the chamber.

The pool is populated by harmless blind fish and white crustaceans but contains nothing dangerous. The outflowing stream drains into the river in **area 29**. Any characters who fell into the pool are carried by the current toward the outflow at about 20 feet per round. A character who ends up in the river might be swept away; see "Fast-Flowing Water."

## 29. River Cavern

> This long, narrow cavern is half-filled with an underground river, flowing along at a rapid pace. A narrow ledge on the north side overlooks the river. A bridge of stone spans the river, leading to a larger ledge on the south side that follows the course of the river to the east.

The underground river flows swiftly from east to west. The bridge is sturdy and sound; there's no danger in crossing it.

### Watery Peril

At the west end of the cavern, the ceiling lowers to meet the surface of the river. Any creature swept past this point by the current is trapped in a long, airless underground channel and is likely to drown (see "Suffocating" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). In addition, the creature must make a successful DC 12 Strength saving throw each round or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage as it is battered by rocks. Even creatures that can breathe water aren't likely to survive for long.

The stream runs underground for about 5 miles before emerging on a hillside to the west of the Stone Tooth.

## 30. Old Storeroom

The northern door in **area 28** has swollen shut from dampness. A successful DC 10 Strength check is required to force it open. Durgeddin's folk formerly used the large chamber beyond as a storeroom.

> The door gives way grudgingly, revealing a low chamber of dressed stone. This chamber is filled with what appears to be rotten food-barrels of salted meat gone bad, sacks of flour or grain covered in russet-colored mold, tuns of cider turned to vinegar.
> 
> Two open archways in the east wall lead to a similar room, and two more openings are dimly visible beyond. The floor just past the first archway gleams wetly.

### Creature

None of the supplies are salvageable. While searching, the characters might blunder into a gray ooze that occupies the middle chamber of the three.

While motionless, the ooze is indistinguishable from a patch of wet stone. It is alerted when characters force open the door, and it strikes at the first character who enters the middle chamber, attacking with surprise.

> What appeared to be a wet patch on the floor suddenly twists like a snake and lunges toward you!

## 31. Empty Storeroom

The southern door in **area 28** is swollen shut and requires a successful DC 10 Strength check to open. The chamber on the other side of the door resembles **area 30**, but it is empty. The orcs broke in and carried off most of its contents during the fall of Khundrukar.

## 32. Flooded Storeroom

A year or so ago, a season of heavy rains on the surface raised the level of the subterranean river to create a minor flood. Water still stands at the bottom of the stairs.

> A short flight of stone steps leads down to a wooden door that stands half-open. Dark, stagnant water pools in the small landing at the base of the steps and in the doorway, presumably filling the room beyond as well. The area smells of rot.

### Diseased Pool

The water is about 5 feet deep and is tainted by disease. Anyone who drinks the water or wades into it is exposed and must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid infection. Symptoms manifest one day after exposure and include high fever, muscle spasms, and eventual paralysis.

An infected creature suffers one level of <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> when it finishes the first long rest it takes after being exposed. Whenever it finishes a long rest thereafter, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers another level of <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch>. On a successful save, its <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> level is reduced by one. If its <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> level reaches 5, the infected creature becomes paralyzed until the disease is cured or the effect is removed with a <wc-fetch type="spell">lesser restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> level to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.

### Treasure

Submerged in the corner of the eastern vault is the skeleton of an orc killed a century ago. The skeleton rests atop a rotted leather pouch that contains a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of water breathing</wc-fetch> and a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of invisibility</wc-fetch>.

## 33. Roper's Cavern

> The rock stairs climb steeply, turn north, and then descend toward the east into a cavern very much like the one you just left, but smaller. A ledge along the river continues east to a door on the north wall, and the rushing river separates you from a ledge on the southern side.
> 
> A large, strange-looking stalagmite stands in the middle of the southern ledge. A cave fish flops helplessly on the bank nearby.

![Roper Fight](adventure/TftYP/TFoFRoper-Fight.jpg)

### Creature

The southern ledge is the home of a ravenous roper that has been feeding on fish from the stream. Unsatisfied with this diet, the roper is eager for larger prey.

Even characters who look closely at the roper can't tell that it's anything other than a stalagmite unless it moves. The roper is difficult to sneak up on. If a character manages to approach without alerting it, continue:

> A strand extends from the stalagmite, with the thrashing cave fish in its grasp. It pulls the fish toward the rock formation-and then, suddenly, a fang-filled maw gapes open in the stalagmite and devours the fish in one bite.

The roper attacks when any character gets at least 20 feet into the cave, gaining surprise if its presence hasn't been revealed. It can target up to four characters with its tendrils, possibly pulling those it has grappled into the rushing river. Characters in the water have advantage on checks to escape the grapple due to the force of the current. The river poses a severe hazard in itself, though; see "Fast-Flowing Water."

### Development

The roper is satisfied, ending the attack, after it devours one Small or larger creature. It can't speak or understand languages, but it has a bestial intelligence and might be persuaded to accept a substitute meal. As long as the food is alive, the roper isn't picky.

### Treasure

Cutting open the roper's stony gizzard reveals a <wc-fetch type="item">ring of spell storing</wc-fetch> and six gemstones: a ruby worth 1,000 gp, two emeralds worth 400 gp each, and three serpentines worth 60 gp apiece.

## 34. Prison

If the characters get past the roper in **area 33**, they can explore an area that was used as a prison in Durgeddin's day.

> A sturdy door of iron plate stands open in the north wall of the cavern. Inside you see a short passageway with three small iron doors set into the west wall. The first two are open, but the door at the end of the hall is closed.

The door to the northern cell is locked. With a search of the grimy floor and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Pereption) check, a character discovers an old jailer's key that fits the lock. Otherwise, the lock can be picked by some one who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

The first two cells are empty. The locked cell holds the skeletal remains of a dwarf in rusted plate armor. This individual was one of Durgeddin's chief lieutenants; the orcs captured her during the final battle and threw her in this cell for interrogation later. Afterward, the unfortunate warrior was forgotten and left to starve.

### Treasure

The suit of plate is too corroded to be of any use, but a search of the corpse produces a small silk purse containing 8 pp and a key that opens the iron door in **area 27**.
