Chult is a land filled with untold wonders and lost treasures. Adventurers will discover this for themselves as they explore the peninsula's uncharted wilderness.

## Flora and Fauna

This section describes unusual wildlife native to Chult. Any character with proficiency in the Nature skill recognizes one of these plants or creatures on sight, and can recall its properties with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. If the character is a native of Chult, this check is made with advantage.

The wildlife described here can be bought and sold in Port Nyanzaru and other settlements for the amounts listed in the Flora and Fauna table.

Some of these things inflict the poisoned condition on a creature for an hour or more. Remember that <wc-fetch type="spell">lesser restoration</wc-fetch> and similar magic can end that condition.

### Dancing Monkey Fruit

This rare magical fruit produces enough juice to fill a vial. Any humanoid that eats a dancing monkey fruit or drinks its juice must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or begin a comic dance that lasts for 1 minute. Humanoids that can't be poisoned are immune to this magical effect.

The dancer must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. Each time it takes damage, the dancer can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. When the dancing effect ends, the humanoid suffers the poisoned condition for 1 hour.

### Menga Leaves

The dried leaves of a menga bush can be ground, dissolved in a liquid, heated, and ingested. A creature that ingests 1 ounce of menga leaves in this fashion regains 1 hit point. A creature that ingests more than 5 ounces of menga leaves in a 24-hour period gains no additional benefit and must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 hour. The unconscious creature awakens if it takes at least 5 damage on one turn.

A healthy menga bush usually has 2d6 ounces of leaves. Once picked, the leaves require 1 day to dry out before they can confer any benefit.

### Ryath Root

Any creature that ingests a ryath root gains 2d4 temporary hit points. A creature that consumes more than one ryath root in a 24-hour period must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the poisoned condition for 1 hour.

### Sinda Berries

These berries are dark brown and bitter. A full-grown sinda berry bush has 4d6 berries growing on it. A bush plucked of all its berries grows new berries in 1d4 months. Picked berries lose their freshness and efficacy after 24 hours.

Fresh sinda berries can be eaten raw or crushed and added to a drink to dull the bitterness. A creature that consumes at least ten fresh sinda berries gains advantage on saving throws against disease and poison for the next 24 hours.

### Wildroot

Introducing the juice of a wildroot into a poisoned creature's bloodstream (for example, by rubbing it on an open wound) rids the creature of the poisoned condition. Once used in this way, a wildroot loses this property.

### Wukka Nuts

These fist-sized nuts grow on wukka trees, which are popular haunts for jaculi, su-monsters, and zorbos. A wukka nut rattles when shaken, causing its shell to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. This magical light fades after 1 minute, but shaking the nut again causes the light to reappear. If the shell of the nut is cracked open, it loses its magic.

### Yahcha

A yahcha (pronounced YAH-chah) is a harmless, meaty beetle about the size of a human hand, which feeds on worms and maggots. It moves slowly (walking speed 10 feet) and is easy to catch. A creature with mad monkey fever that eats a raw or cooked yahcha can immediately make a saving throw with advantage against that disease (see _"Diseases,"_).

### Zabou

Zabou mushrooms feed on offal and the rotting wood of dead trees. If handled carefully, a zabou can be picked or uprooted without causing it to release its spores. If crushed or struck, a zabou releases its spores in a 10-foot-radius sphere. A zabou can also be hurled up to 30 feet away or dropped like a grenade, releasing its cloud of spores on impact. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature's skin itches for the duration. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
