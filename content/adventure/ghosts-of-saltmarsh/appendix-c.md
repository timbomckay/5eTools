This appendix details creatures and nonplayer characters that are mentioned in this book and that don't appear in the Monster Manual. That book's introduction explains how to interpret a stat block.

Some of these creatures are also described in Tomb of Annihilation, Volo's Guide to Monsters, and Princes of the Apocalypse but are reproduced here for your convenience.

The creatures are presented in alphabetical order.

### Amphisbaena

Found in Danger at Dunwater, these strange reptiles have a head at either end of their serpentine bodies, each one equipped with venomous fangs. To move, an amphisbaena uses one head to grip the neck of its other head, forming a hoop that rolls over the ground.

### Assassin Vine

An assassin vine is an ambulatory plant that collects its fertilizer by grabbing and crushing prey and depositing the carcasses near its roots. It usually stays put unless it needs to seek out prey. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch from the main vine every 6 inches. In late summer, the secondary vines produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor.

A subterranean variant grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of heat. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.

### Bard

bard are gifted poets, storytellers, and entertainers who travel far and wide, but are commonly found in taverns or in the company of jolly bands of adventurers, rough-and-tumble mercenaries, and wealthy patrons.

### Bodak

A bodak numbers among the numerous undead guardians in Isle of the Abbey. These soulless terrors, each one risen from the remains of someone who revered Orcus, Lord of the Undead, exist only to spread further suffering and death.

### Bullywug Croaker

Some bullywug croaker are born with the ability to weave magic into their songs. These rare specimens are raised in protected enclaves where they are taught to use their magic to both heal and harm. As demonstrated in Danger at Dunwater, they are among the most pompous of bullywugs.

### Bullywug Royal

The largest and most intelligent bullywug royal invariably end up leading their kind. These sneering specimens dress in robes made from leather, rough cloth, and bits of marsh plants. As seen in Danger at Dunwater, a bullywug royal is often accompanied by and mounted astride a giant toad.

### Deep Scion

Deep scion began life as people who were stolen from shore or saved from sinking ships and offered a terrible bargain by an undersea power: surrender, body and soul, or drown. Those who submit are subjected to an ancient ritual widespread among evil aquatic creatures. Its methods are painful and the result never certain, but when it works, the magic transforms an air-breathing person into a shapechanger that can take a form that is fully at home beneath the waves.

### Drowned Ascetic

Dressed in tattered robes, its fists wrapped in long ribbons of rotting cloth, the drowned ascetic moves with alarming speed for an undead creature. This martial artist, rising from the ocean in Tammeraut's Fate, retains its fighting reflexes despite its rotting flesh.

> #### Bluerot
> 
> This disease targets humanoids. While afflicted with bluerot, a victim grows grotesque blue boils on their face and back. This disease is carried by undead (including the drowned ones in Tammeraut's Fate), and victims most often acquire it through wounds caused by infected creatures.
> 
>  The disease's boils manifest in <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> hours, causing the victim's Constitution and Charisma scores to decrease by <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> each, to a minimum of 3. This is quickly followed by a fever and tingling in the extremities. An infected creature is vulnerable to radiant damage and gains the ability to breathe underwater.
> 
>  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the victim regains 1 point of Constitution and 1 point of Charisma lost to the disease. If the infected creature regains all the points lost to the disease, it is cured. Other effects that raise the victim's ability scores do not cure the disease. On a failed saving throw, the victim takes 18 (<wc-roll>4d8</wc-roll>) necrotic damage as the boils burst and spread. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage cannot regain hit points until the disease is cured, though it can be stabilized as normal.

### Drowned Assassin

The drowned assassin stalks and kills in a grim pantomime of its former occupation. Sneaking from shadow to shadow, and appearing in the undead assault of Tammeraut's Fate, it aims its barnacle-encrusted hand crossbow with deadly precision. Hidden behind a simple driftwood mask, this creature's face causes terror in mortal hearts when exposed.

### Drowned Blade

Assaulting the hermitage in Tammeraut's Fate, this barnacle-encrusted undead warrior fights with surprising cunning. Starfish cling to its wispy beard, and its evil rage is visible the drowned blade bloated gray eyes.

### Drowned Master

This waterlogged undead, bound to the Pit of Hatred in Tammeraut's Fate, hovers menacingly over the bones of its victims. Its torso, arms, and head retain their former shapes, but its legs have split into shadowy tentacles. The drowned master is tethered to a source of powerful magic that prevents it from traveling far. It commands other drowned ones, compelling them to serve as agents in its dark plots.

### Fathomer

Fathomer are cultists who have sealed a pact with Olhydra, elemental Princess of Evil Water. In addition to their spellcasting abilities, fathomers have the ability to transform their bodies into water, taking serpent-like shapes. In their water serpent forms, fathomers gain many of the resistances that elemental creatures possess, as well as the ability to grapple and crush their enemies with their watery bodies.

### Giant Coral Snake

Comfortable on land or in water, these brilliantly Giant Coral Snake are renowned for their potent and hallucinogenic venom. They are most often found in coastal caves. In the abandoned chambers of the hermitage in Tammeraut's Fate, these giant serpents feed on any creature that crosses their path.

### Giant Sea Eel

Snaking predators lurking in the dark waters of the ocean, these Giant Sea Eel serve as guards and mounts for the locathah (including those found in Danger at Dunwater).

### Harpy Matriarch

Happy to watch its flock squabble over carrion in Tammeraut's Fate, this gray-feathered Harpy Matriarch is surrounded by a cloud of magical spirits resembling skeletal seabirds.

### Juvenile Kraken

Hidden in a deep, dark underwater pit near the Styes, this Juvenile Kraken bears the mark of the dark god Tharizdun's madness. Becoming more independent every day, it dreams of freeing itself from its aboleth tenders and wreaking its own foul will upon the seas.

### Koalinth Sergeant

These fierce koalinths lead special missions for their people, such as the diplomatic envoy encountered in Danger at Dunwater. A koalinth sergeant focuses its ire on the most significant threats on the battlefield, then eliminates those threats one by one.

### Kraken Priest

A kraken can seem godlike to folk who have witnessed its fury. Those who believe that its might comes from being a divine entity and those who seek to appease the monster through its veneration sometimes find themselves infused with special abilities, to serve thereafter as kraken priest.

### Kysh (Triton)

A prisoner of the sahuagin in The Final Enemy, Kysh is a defender of the deep sea realms who is ready to join the party in their struggle. Tritons are folk of the Elemental Plane of Water who journeyed to the Material Plane to watch over the dark places of the ocean depths. They stand guard over portals, deep sea chasms, and other places where foul monsters might emerge. When such threats appear, the tritons take up arms to drive them from the world.

The lizardfolk subchief (seen in Danger at Dunwater) is a devout priest of Semuanya, pursuing the worship of its god in a manner similar to a cleric. It wields a dagger crafted of a massive crocodile tooth blessed by Semuanya, representing the subchief's prowess in both battle and piety.

### Locathah

These resilient and proud Locathah (found in Danger at Dunwater) have endured war, slavery, and mistreatment at the hands of other aquatic creatures. They dwell in submerged tribal communities along seacoasts, and hunt both above and below the water.

### Locathah Hunter

The far-ranging locathah hunter is trained in tracking and stalking prey on land and in water. They often serve as leaders to small bands of locathah or emissaries for their people (such as the hunter found in Danger at Dunwater). Their colorful, <wc-fetch type="condition">poisoned</wc-fetch>, and fast-loading crossbows rarely miss a target.

### Maw Demon

A quartet of squat fiends—all mouth and malice—turn their bottomless hunger to Lolth's servants in Salvage Operation. Infamous for their ceaseless hunger for carnage and mortal flesh, these fiends devour all in their paths. After a maw demon rests for 8 hours, anything it has devoured is transported to the Abyss for further digestion of a different sort.

### Maw of Sekolah

Summoned from the shadowy depths of the ocean through ritual and tidal magic, the Maw of Sekolah appears in The Final Enemy as the avatar of the hungry sahuagin god. This huge, two-headed shark is fed a steady diet of sentient creatures, captured by the sahuagin and offered up as tribute. Sahuagin priestesses adorn the fins of the maw of Sekolah with gemmed bands and polished skulls.

### Merfolk Salvager

Veterans of scouring the wrecks and ruins found in the deepest waters, these Merfolk Salvager help defend their kin with rapier-like weapons of living coral. The salvagers escort other merfolk on scavenging missions, using their keen senses to detect danger. They are found allying with the lizardfolk in Danger at Dunwater.

### Minotaur Living Crystal Statue

![undefined](adventure/GoS/121-zc-05-p245.png)

### Monstrous Peryton

The terror of the coast and the recent scourge of Firewatch Island in Tammeraut's Fate, this Monstrous Peryton preys on ships and coastal communities alike. It has built numerous nests to mark its territory.

### Mr. Dory

One of the four councillors who rule the Styes, Mr. Dory hides his cursed nature in plain sight. His rare, liquid-sensitive "skin condition" is actually a form of the same aboleth affliction that creates skum, though Dory's condition is not as severe, and he has managed to retain his free will.

![undefined](adventure/GoS/122-zc-06-p246.png)

### Oceanus (Sea Elf)

![undefined](adventure/GoS/123-zc-07-p247.png)

The Pirate Bosun (or boatswain) is tasked with organizing the cargo and crew aboard a ship. Bosuns are capable fighters whose experience with hauling cargo and delivering beatings make them tough opponents.

Pirate captain spend their lives at sea, earning and keeping command through blood and daring. A captain's impressive sword work and biting words inspire both confidence and fear in a ship's crew. Sigurd "Snake Eyes" is the pirate captain who leads a gang of smugglers in The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh.

### Pirate Deck Wizard

These salt-encrusted Pirate Deck Wizard are at once learned and superstitious. The crews of pirate ships generally give their deck wizards a wide berth, as they magically step from place to place and unleash their briny magic against attackers. The ship _Sea Ghost_ in The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh is home to a pirate deck wizard named Punketah.

### Pirate First Mate

### Rip Tide Priest

Rip Tide Priest gather in secret cabals to perform dark rituals that glorify Olhydra, the elemental Princess of Evil Water, as the embodiment of water's destructiveness. They believe that using water to kill their enemies, such as through ritual drowning, earns them Olhydra's favor.

![undefined](adventure/GoS/125-636936213737158195.png)

### Skeletal Juggernaut

As seen lumbering across the beaches in Isle of the Abbey, a skeletal juggernaut is an oversized, bipedal assembly of bones that loses a portion of its mass with each step. These skeletal guardians hold together for only a short time before disassembling into a gang of individual undead.

![undefined](adventure/GoS/126-zc-09-p253.png)

### Skeletal Swarm

This Skeletal Swarm found rising out of the sand in Isle of the Abbey is made from the remains of several animated skeletons. A skeletal swarm alternates its appearance between partially formed humanoid shapes and a chaotic, swirling mass.

### Skum

Several poor souls around the Styes have succumbed to an aboleth's magic through its disease-bearing touch. Transformed into creatures called skum, they barely resemble their past forms, their skin turning slimy and translucent while their limbs warp to resemble those of deep-sea oddities. The change makes them dependent on water, which they must immerse themselves in regularly lest they experience painful—and potentially lethal—skin eruptions. Skum are bound to their aboleth master not just by their cursed state, but by a psychic bond that compels them to serve its every sinister whim.

![undefined](adventure/GoS/127-636918877666194101.png)

### Storm Giant Quintessent

Some Storm Giant Quintessent approaching the end of their natural life spans seek an escape from death. They plumb the depths of their powerful connection to the elements and disperse themselves into nature, literally transforming into semiconscious storms.

### Swarm of Rot Grubs

Swarm of Rot Grubs are finger-sized maggots that eat living or dead flesh, although they can subsist on plant matter. They infest corpses and piles of decaying matter and attack living creatures that disturb them. After burrowing into the flesh of a living creature, a rot grub instinctively chews its way toward the heart in order to kill its host.

Rot grubs pose a threat both singly and as a swarm. See the accompanying stat block for the mechanics of a swarm of rot grubs.

A single rot grub has no stat block. Any creature that comes into contact with one must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the rot grub burrows into the creature's flesh and deals 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) piercing damage at the start of each of the host creature's turns. Applying fire to the wound before the end of the host creature's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the host and kills the infesting rot grub. After this time, the rot grub is too far under the host creature's skin to be burned. If a creature infested by one or more rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target. Burning a body kills any rot grubs infesting it.

### Thousand Teeth the Devourer

Thousand Teeth is an ancient crocodilian nightmare that has served as the apex predator in the swamps near Saltmarsh for as long as anyone can remember. This monster recently fought a number of lizardfolk and lost one of its teeth. Angered and hungry, it sulks in its lair, lost in primal dreams of rending and tearing. It is found in the deep marshes in Danger at Dunwater.

### Vampiric Jade Statue

A large, exquisitely carved Vampiric Jade Statue of a vampire guards the tunnels in Isle of the Abbey, having been brought to life by dark magic. Its stone fangs draw blood that it then uses to work a curse on its victims.
