This level of Undermountain is designed for four 6th-level characters. Those who overcome this level's challenges should amass enough XP to reach 7th level.

## What Dwells Here?

A tribe of goblins has claimed many rooms on this level and erected a bazaar. These goblins oppose the Xanathar Guild and its beholder overlord. The rest of the dungeon is infested with sentient magical experiments and leftovers from the days when Halaster's apprentices used this level as a laboratory. The characters might also encounter a troublesome drow, a wererat gang, and members of a doomed adventuring party.

### Goblins

The Rustbone tribe of goblins has claimed an old throne room (**area area 1**) and turned it into a bazaar. The Xanathar Guild wants to shut down the market before it attracts too many surface dwellers, while the goblins fight to keep it open. Admission into the goblin bazaar is free, but non-goblinoids are closely watched.

The goblin boss, Yek, recently found a magic circlet that transformed him into a human (see **area area 1f**). After his initial surprise passed, Yek warmed to the transformation. After all, it made him taller. The other goblins quietly resent taking orders from a human and would like to see Yek returned to normal. They might conspire with adventurers toward that end, offering them the circlet as a reward for undoing Yek's "curse."

### Xanathar Guild

The Xanathar Guild aims to secure this level, plunder it thoroughly, and return valuable items to Skullport to be sold, thus boosting the town's sagging economy. There are two Xanathar Guild watch posts on the level, and each one has a leader: a drow named Shunn "Spider Eyes" Shurreth commands the northern watch post at **area area 9**, and a human berserker named Nadia the Unbent leads the southern watch post at **area area 20**.

Wererats recently stole a stone key from the southern outpost. Shunn believes that the key unlocks something important (though he doesn't know what that might be) and wants to reclaim it. He intends to capture a wererat and ransom it for the safe return of the key. He offers 50 gp to anyone who brings him a wererat captive or the location of the wererats' hideout (**area area 14**).

### Drow and Wererat Gang

A drow mage in league with the Zhentarim has set up a hidden base on this level (**area area 14**). The drow, Rizzeryl, has eight wererats in his employ. The Xanathar Guild is aware of the wererats, but not their drow master.

Rizzeryl has the stone key that the wererats stole from the Xanathar Guild. He thinks it might unlock a Melairkyn vault hidden somewhere on this level, but he's wrong. In fact, the key opens a magic gate that connects levels 6 and 8 of Undermountain. The drow will give up this key in exchange for his life or the destruction of the Xanathar Guild outposts on this level.

### Fine Fellows of Daggerford

Characters who explore this level might encounter three members of the Fine Fellows of Daggerford, an evil adventuring party. If Halleth the revenant (see **area level 1, area 37**) accompanies the characters, he uses his Vengeful Tracker trait to lead the party to his former companions so he can repay them for their betrayal. These three "Fine Fellows" are:

- Copper Stormforge, a dwarven thief, values gold above all. He has been captured by goblins and imprisoned in **area area 1e**.
- Midna Tauberth, a human priest of Shar, thinks she can do everything herself. The perils of this level have forced her to take refuge in **area area 11b**.
- Rex the Hammer, a human warrior, seeks fortune and glory, and doesn't care whom he steps on to achieve it. The characters find him at the mercy of the mezzoloth in **area area 13g**.

### Mutated Apprentices

Halaster handed over this level to his fervent pupils, almost all of whom were driven mad by their studies and mutated by the magic they wrought, becoming gibbering mouthers and nothics. A mezzoloth summoned from the Lower Planes to serve as a wizard's assistant now rules over them all.

### Wandering Monsters

Monsters wander this level of Undermountain in search of food or treasure. Such monsters include carrion crawlers, gricks, mephits, owlbears, and spectators. If your game session needs a greater challenge, try adding one or more of these monsters to an encounter of your own design.

## Exploring This Level

All location descriptions for the Arcane Chambers are keyed to map 2.

![(Player Version)](adventure/WDMM/006-203.jpg)

### 1. Goblin Bazaar

In this monstrous market live forty goblins. Half of them are guards, and the other half are traders. The goblin boss and his retinue lurk in **area area 1e**.

#### 1a. Bazaar Side Entrance

> **Detritus**. Trash and debris litter the floor.
> 
> **Bas-Reliefs**. The walls are adorned with bas-reliefs that once depicted dwarves carrying supplies. The dwarves' faces have been chipped away and replaced with cartoonish goblin heads drawn in charcoal.
> 
> **Noise**. Banging noises can be heard to the north. (The goblins in **area area 1b** are building a wooden stage there.)

#### 1b. Auction Hall

The goblins are erecting a stage against the north wall of this 20-foot-high chamber using wood stolen from elsewhere in Undermountain. Once the stage is complete, the goblins plan to auction slaves and other valuable merchandise here. The stage will be quite large when it's finished but is still in the preliminary stages of assembly. A pile of wrecked wooden furniture lies in the area's northwest corner.

Seven Goblin are here. Three of them are using stone hammers to pound rusty nails through decrepit wooden planks. The other four are clustered in the middle of the room, passing around a scroll on which someone has drawn a crude blueprint of a stage. If attacked, these goblins retreat to **area area 1d**. They otherwise pay no attention to strangers.

##### Treasure

The goblins carry a total of 27 cp and 15 sp.

#### 1c. Gibbets and Gravy

Four iron gibbets hang from chains hooked to the 10-foot-high ceiling. The gibbets are empty except for one that holds a wailing goblin named Glom.

Glom was caught stealing food intended for the goblin boss, Yek. She hasn't eaten in two days and happily provides information or her service as a guide in exchange for food or freedom. She knows about the magic circlet that turned Yek into a human and where the goblin boss keeps the rest of his treasure (**area area 1f**).

Glom knows the general layout of this level of Undermountain, the positions of the Xanathar Guild outposts, and the location of the stairs leading down to level 3. Glom eagerly betrays her liberators if someone with more food and the promise of a better life comes along.

The lock on Glom's gibbet can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. It can also be broken off with a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check or a solid weapon blow.

#### 1d. Market Hall

> **Ceiling**. This room has a soaring, 60-foot-high ceiling supported by two rows of stone pillars.
> 
> **Goblin Vendors**. The middle of the chamber is taken up by eight vendor stalls. Twenty-two Goblin are here, sixteen vendors (two per stall) and six guards who stand in pairs near the exits to **area areas 1e**, **area 1f**, and **area 8**.
> 
> **Throne**. A granite throne stands against the north wall atop a rectangular stone dais.

The goblin vendors buy and sell stolen goods, including items listed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbookâ€”particularly armor, shields, weapons, adventuring gear, tools, trade goods, food, and drink. The goblins buy goods at half the normal price and sell them at three times the normal price. Their food is of poor quality but edible. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Intimidation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check can bargain a goblin down to half its asking price for an item.

The goblin guards have orders to keep the peace. If a brawl or a battle erupts, they attack with the goal of knocking troublesome visitors <wc-fetch type="condition">unconscious</wc-fetch>. Visitors whom the guards subdue are dragged out of the market and left in **area area 8** without their weapons or treasure. (Any treasure the goblins take is placed in **area area 1f**.)

##### Throne

Yek sits here when he deigns to preside over the market. The throne has been draped with animal skins and festooned with monster skulls and trinkets twisted up in wire.

##### Treasure

The goblin guards have a total of 25 cp and 20 sp. Each goblin vendor carries a fat pouch with <wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll> gp, <wc-roll>3d8</wc-roll> sp, and <wc-roll>3d10</wc-roll> cp in it.

#### 1e. Yek the Tall

> **Torches**. Flickering torches in iron brackets light this room.
> 
> **Bugbears**. Four Bugbear stand in the room's corners.
> 
> **Goblins**. A handsome man wearing a golden circlet on his brow (Yek the Tall, a goblin boss in altered form) reclines on a mound of cushions at the north end of the room, eating an apple. Ten Goblin (Yek's toadies) lie about on moldy cushions around him.
> 
> **Prisoner**. Chained to the south wall is a male dwarf clad in leather armor who has been gagged. He has copper-orange hair, but his beard has been shaved off (see "Shaved Dwarf" below).

The bugbears work for Yek because he pays them. A bugbear abandons Yek and returns home to Skullport (on level 3) if given a bribe of 5 gp or more.

If Yek orders the goblins into battle, they fight reluctantly. If half are killed or <wc-fetch type="condition">incapacitated</wc-fetch>, the rest flee. The goblins also run away if Yek is slain.

Yek wears a gold circlet (see "Treasure" below) that has transformed him into a beautiful adult male human. In this form, his size is Medium. If the characters humble themselves before Yek and appeal to his vanity, they are treated fairly. If they attempt to steal from him or have harmed any of his underlings, Yek sentences them to death and orders his goblin toadies and the bugbears to attack. Yek joins the fray only in self-defense.

If the characters and Yek part company on peaceful terms, three of Yek's goblin toadies try to speak to the characters afterward, away from the goblin boss. They plead with the characters to end Yek's "curse" by stealing the circlet that has transformed the goblin boss into a human. They don't have a plan for doing so and are hoping the characters can devise one. The toadies can get all the other goblins out of the hall, but they have no control over Yek's bugbear bodyguards.

##### Shaved Dwarf

The beardless dwarf is Copper Stormforge, a member of the Fine Fellows of Daggerford adventuring party. His hatred for goblins increased tenfold when they chopped off his beard, and if he is set free, he tries to kill every one of them.

As a reward for setting him free, Copper gives his liberators what he claims is an authentic map of the Sargauth Level (level 3). Copper folded the map into a tiny package and tucked it between his butt cheeks to hide it from his captors. He doesn't realize the map is fake and utterly worthless.

Copper is a shield dwarf scout, with these changes:

- Copper is neutral evil.
- He has these racial traits: He speaks Common and Dwarvish. His walking speed is 25 feet. He has <wc-fetch type="sense">darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance to poison damage.
- He has no weapons.

##### Treasure

The goblins under Yek carry a total of 60 cp and 25 sp. Each bugbear carries a large pouch that contains 15 gp.

Yek's circlet is an uncommon magic item called a <wc-fetch type="item">circlet of human perfection</wc-fetch>. Only humanoids can attune to it. The circlet transforms its attuned wearer into an attractive human of average height and weight. The circlet chooses the physical characteristics of the form, such as age, gender, skin color, hair color, and voice. Except for size, the wearer's statistics and racial traits don't change, nor do items worn or carried by the wearer. Removing the circlet ends the effect.

#### 1f. Yek's Treasure

This room contains the following treasure:

- A gruesome diorama featuring the stuffed corpses of a beholder and six goblins, all of them in battle poses and adorned with costume jewelry
- An ivory chessboard on a low stone table
- A 9-foot-tall, 3-foot-wide framed painting of Yek, depicting him in his regal human form, standing proudly with his golden circlet on his brow
- A hefty, iron-banded wooden chest with iron rings for handles

Characters who loot the diorama find fifteen pieces of costume jewelry worth 1 gp each. The ivory chessboard is worth 25 gp. The wooden chest is filled with 2,000 sp.

The painting of Yek has no real value, though a clever character can sell it for 50 gp by convincing a naive buyer that the painting depicts a figure of historical importance; doing so requires a successful DC 13 Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Deception</wc-fetch>) check.

### 2. Kalabash's Chambers

Kalabash was one of Halaster's apprentices, though not one of the original seven. He has been trapped in a pocket dimension for hundreds of years now and is completely insane. Characters might stumble across him as they explore his chambers.

#### 2a. Water Pump

In the center of this room is a rusted iron hand pump and a deep stone basin. This pump draws water from a spring between levels of the dungeon. Using an action to crank the pump draws <wc-roll>1d4 + 1</wc-roll> gallons of potable water into the stone basin.

#### 2b. Abandoned Laboratory

This room is filled with dusty tables and cauldrons. Its stone hearth is cold. Piled atop the tables are alchemical tools and equipment, all of it ancient to the point of being unusable. Disturbing the laboratory in any way alerts the specter in **area area 2c**.

#### 2c. Wizard's Kitchen

This decrepit kitchen contains an oven range, a washing basin, a hearth bearing a covered cook pot, and shelves filled with pots, pans, and cooking tools.

A specter hides in the covered cook pot, emerging if the lid is lifted or if the specter is disturbed by noises from **area area 2b**. The specter can command four nearby pots and pans to do its bidding; treat these objects as Flying Sword that deal bludgeoning damage instead of slashing damage. If the specter is defeated, the pots and pans clatter to the ground, becoming inanimate once more.

#### 2d. Kalabash's Bedroom

The door to this room bears a sign written in Common that reads, "Kalabash's Room. Do not enter unless your name is Halaster." The room contains the following:

> **Furnishings**. A dusty bed stands with its headboard against the north wall. At the foot of the bed rests a locked wooden chest (see "Trapped Chest" below). A desk in the southeast corner has stacks of musty old tomes atop it (see "Treasure" below).
> 
> **Summoning Circle**. An old rug woven with arcane symbols lies in the middle of the floor. (Beneath the rug, painted on the stone floor, is a 10-foot-diameter summoning circle that has been partially erased.)

The summoning circle hidden under the rug radiates an aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell, but three of its activation glyphs have been erased. A character who examines the circle and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check can reconstruct the circle and, with blood or paint, reapply the missing glyphs in <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> minutes.

If the circle is completed, it immediately summons Kalabash (CE male Calishite human mage). Appearing in the middle of the circle, Kalabash attacks any creatures he sees. He is intoxicated and suffers the effects of the <wc-fetch type="condition">poisoned</wc-fetch> condition until he sobers up or until the condition is ended with a <wc-fetch type="spell">lesser restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. Erasing part of the completed circle causes Kalabash to be whisked back to his pocket dimension.

The only item of value Kalabash has is his spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared. He also carries around an empty wine flask.

##### Trapped Chest

The wooden chest is of solid construction, and its steel lock is warded with a magic trap. Picking the lock requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If that check does not succeed, or if anyone tries to break or smash the lock, the mechanism releases a small bolt of lightning that deals 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) lightning damage to the creature tampering with it (no saving throw). The chest is empty except for a note in Common that reads, "Retirement fund. Don't spend this on ale, Kalabash!"

##### Treasure

The desk has twenty old books on it. Each book is blank and can be sold for 10 gp.

### 3. Halaster Puppet

Both doors to this room are difficult to open because furniture inside has been piled against them. A successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check forces open either door. Apart from these crude barricades, the room contains the following:

> **Automaton**. An animated, life-size puppet of Halaster Blackcloak is hard at work on an experiment. The puppet is made primarily of wood and canvas, with a shoddy gray cloak draped over its shoulders. Dozens of cloth eyes have been sewn into the cloak.
> 
> **Table**. The puppet looms over a stone table covered with dusty alchemical equipment and vials of various solid and liquid substances, but nothing valuable or dangerous.

The puppet responds to any movement within 20 feet of it and threatens any creature that comes closer, shouting in Halaster's voice, "Terrible and painful magical death! Fireballs and lightning bolts! Begone!" It speaks and understands Common, but voices nothing but empty threats and a desire to continue its "work" undisturbed. If asked what it's working on, it shouts, "Magic!" and chuckles. A character who watches the puppet work and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch>) check ascertains that the puppet isn't doing anything other than mixing harmless substances while muttering gobbledygook.

The puppet is a Medium construct with AC 10, 8 hit points, a walking speed of 20 feet, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and ability scores of 10. It can't be <wc-fetch type="condition">charmed</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="condition">frightened</wc-fetch>, and it is not subject to <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch>. It speaks and understands Common, has no attacks, and falls to pieces if reduced to 0 hit points or if a successful <wc-fetch type="spell">dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 15) is cast on it. Hidden inside the puppet is a flask of alchemist's fire that shatters as the puppet falls to pieces, causing its remnants to catch fire. The breaking flask does no harm to nearby creatures.

If the puppet is destroyed, Halaster's voice magically calls out, "Auugh! Now who will find the cure to filth fever?!" before trailing off into silence.

### 4. Abandoned Camp

The Xanathar Guild had a base camp here, but it was forced to abandon the place after a run-in with the Fine Fellows of Daggerford.

This room is strewn with rotten supplies and the remains of a fire pit. Three bugbear corpses and an intellect devourer's body are heaped in the northeast corner. Searching the corpses reveals a scrap of parchment with the following phrase written on it in Common: "As many as there are stars in the sky." This is the pass phrase to safely enter the Xanathar Guild outpost at **area area 9**.

### 5. Arch Gate to Level 4

This dusty room is hidden behind a secret door disguised to look like a plain section of wall.

Embedded in the middle of the room's north wall is a stone arch, its frame engraved with images of falling coins. The arch's keystone has a tiny slot in it. This is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "**area Gates**"), and its rules are as follows:

- Feeding a gold coin into the slot in the keystone causes the coin to disappear and the gate to open for 1 minute. Other coins placed in the slot disappear but don't open the gate.
- Characters must be 8th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "**area Jhesiyra Kestellharp**"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "**area Elder Runes**").
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in **area area 11c on level 4**, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.

### 6. Music of the Dead

The hallway leading to this chamber is filled with the haunting sound of a harpsichord playing. The room contains the following:

> **Harpsichord**. in the middle of the room is a harpsichord made entirely of bones, with human, dwarf, ogre, and halfling finger bones for keys. somber music emanates from it.
> 
> **Carving**. Carved into the north wall is a single measure of musical notes. They are faded and difficult to read.

The bone harpsichord has been enchanted to play on its own but stops when a living creature comes within 10 feet of it. A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the harpsichord and a smaller aura of necromancy magic emanating from something inside it.

Any character who has proficiency with a musical instrument can correctly play the displayed notes on the bone harpsichord. Any other character who tries to do so must make a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Performance</wc-fetch>) check. A successful check causes a decorative skull above the keys to fall away, revealing the treasure (see "Treasure" below). On a failed check, the performer must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the performer takes 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) necrotic damage, and the flesh of its hands is eaten away, leaving bleached white (but functional) skeletal hands.

##### Treasure

Hidden inside the harpsichord is a <wc-fetch type="item">spell scroll</wc-fetch> of <wc-fetch type="spell">raise dead</wc-fetch>. Correctly playing the musical notes opens a hidden compartment that contains the scroll. Smashing or breaking open the harpsichord damages the scroll, rendering it useless.

### 7. Shocking Discoveries

Several chambers where mining equipment and copper ore were once stored are now occupied by laboratories devoted to experiments in electricity and necromancy. Trenzia, one of Halaster's new apprentices, conducts her research here.

#### 7a. Trenzia's Workroom

This well-maintained workroom reeks of rotting flesh and ozone. Odd metal instruments designed for measuring electricity rest atop tables, along with several loose scraps of parchment with notes that include terms such as "rate of decay" and "accumulation of charge."

##### Log Entry

A thorough search of the room yields a scrap of paper that was once part of Trenzia's log. It reads, "Day 1: Halaster has granted me this abandoned copper mine in the Arcane Chambers. Finally, I have access to the components needed for my experiments." Everything beyond that point is smudged and illegible.

#### 7b. Ghoul Barrels

> **Barrels**. Twelve sealed wooden barrels covered in dust rest against the walls. Three are empty, three contain fist-sized chunks of copper ore (50 gp worth of copper per barrel), and the remaining six each have one ghoul crammed inside. Disturbing any of these barrels causes all six ghouls to burst forth and attack.
> 
> **Hammock**. A hammock laden with blankets hangs from anchors in the north wall (see "Log Entry" below).
> 
> **Copper-Plated Door**. A copper-plated door is set into the southeast corner.

The copper-plated door is connected to the lightning grid in **area area 7c**. Unless the creatures in **area area 7c** have been destroyed, the door emits a soft hum when approached. A creature that touches the humming door must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature wearing metal armor has disadvantage on the saving throw.

##### Log Entry

Tucked into the folds of the hammock's moldy blankets is another page from Trenzia's log. The only legible text reads as follows: "Day 3. I no longer trust the other apprentices. What they see as mysticism I know to be science! I can't stand their incantations and their mutterings any longer. If any of them try to intrude on my laboratory again, they're in for a truly shocking surprise!"

#### 7c. Trenzia's Laboratory

Trenzia turned this laboratory into a giant lightning trap, sacrificing herself in its construction.

> **Copper Tiles**. The floor is plated with copper tiles.
> 
> **Lightning Skull**. The metal-coated skull of a half-elf (Trenzia) floats around the room, giving off crackling sounds as it electrifies the floor with rays of lightning (see "Trenzia" below).
> 
> **Golem**. A flesh golem stands in the middle of the room amid destroyed tables, shards of broken glass, and rusty mining equipment.
> 
> **Chute**. A 5-foot-wide, 5-foot-high chute in the southeast corner curves downward, descending 20 feet to **area area 13a**. (The chute contains plenty of handholds and footholds. No ability check is required to descend it.)

##### Trenzia

After she was driven mad by her scientific and necromantic experiments, Trenzia convinced Halaster to transform her into a flameskull, with these changes:

- The skull has resistance to fire damage and immunity to lightning damage.
- It has the <wc-fetch type="spell">lightning bolt</wc-fetch> spell prepared instead of <wc-fetch type="spell">fireball</wc-fetch>.
- Replace its Fire Ray attack option with a Lightning Ray attack option that deals lightning damage instead of fire damage.

On each of its turns, the skull uses its action to electrify the copper-plated floor with its lightning rays. The floor remains electrified until the start of the skull's next turn. While the floor is electrified, any creature that steps onto the copper tiles or starts its turn in contact with them takes 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) lightning damage. Instead of taking damage, the flesh golem regains 10 hit points whenever it starts its turn on the electrified floor.

If the skull is destroyed and later rejuvenates (see the flameskull's Rejuvenation trait), it resumes electrifying the floor and defending the room, with or without the golem.

##### Flesh Golem

The flesh golem has instructions to kill all intruders and never leave the room. It obeys these and the skull's other commands until it goes berserk. If the golem attacks Trenzia's skull in its berserk frenzy, the skull uses its next action to try to calm the golem. While attempting to calm the golem, the skull can't electrify the floor.

#### 7d. Mining Woes

Three Ghast hunker down behind the door leading into this room, waiting to attack.

This room contains the remains of a mining operation. Pickaxes and hammers litter the floor, as do the gnawed bones, torn black robes, and rubber boots of a female half-elf wizard. Notably absent is the half-elf's skull. (The bones and clothing belonged to Trenzia. Halaster fed her body to the ghasts.)

#### 7e. Copper Vein

> **Copper Vein**. An exposed bit of stonework has a thick vein of copper ore running through it.
> 
> **Litter**. A scrap of paper lies on the floor.

The scrap of paper is another partial entry from Trenzia's log that reads, "Day 10. With lightning and copper wires, I created a pack of ghouls. Hal was not impressed. He says I'm not ready for Dweomercore and its arcane secrets. I'll show him. His flesh golem has given me an idea for a trap more devious than any Hal could devise. Lightningâ€”is there anything it can't do?"

### 8. Fresco Cross Hall

Frescoes on the walls of this four-way intersection depict shield dwarves at work. Magic causes the images to move. The dwarves roll and stack barrels, carve blocks of stone, drink from stone tankards, and so forth. As the characters make their way down each hall, the dwarves wave at them and occasionally wink. These animated frescoes are harmless.

### 9. Spider Eyes Watch Post

The Xanathar Guild claims this corner of the dungeon. Shunn Shurreth, a drow exile favored by the beholder crime lord, commands the forces stationed here.

#### 9a. Trapped Hall

> **Bugbears**. Two Bugbear stand guard at the east end of this long hall, where it narrows to a width of 10 feet.
> 
> **Dart Traps**. The northern wall conceals five poison dart traps, triggered by hidden pressure plates in the floor marked T on map 2.

The bugbears, Bolgus and Bulkar, disarm the poison dart traps when Xanathar Guild members approach. When unfamiliar creatures approach from the west, Bolgus shouts for them to halt and Bulkar asks, "How many eyes does Xanathar have?" The correct reply is, "As many as there are stars in the sky." If anyone gives them the wrong pass phrase, the bugbears invite them forward but don't disarm the traps.

If the characters approach from **area area 9b** without a Xanathar Guild escort, the bugbears attack them.

##### Poison Darts

The five poison dart traps are embedded in the walls north of the pressure plates. A character who searches the hall for traps and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check spots the nearest pressure plate and the dart holes in the wall north of it.

When more than 20 pounds of weight are placed on a pressure plate, four darts shoot from the north wall. Each dart makes a ranged attack (+8 to hit) against a random target above the pressure plate. On a hit, a dart deals 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each trap can be triggered three times before its supply of darts is exhausted.

##### Hidden Lever

A lever, concealed by a false section of stone near where the bugbears stand, arms and disarms the poison dart traps. A character who searches the area finds the false stone and lever with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check.

#### 9b. Shunn's Gang

> **Lanterns**. Battered oil lanterns rest atop toppled blocks of stone, illuminating this partially collapsed hall.
> 
> **Furnishings**. Crates, barrels, and seven wooden cots line the walls.
> 
> **Xanathar Guild**. Seven Xanathar Guild members (NE human Thug) and their leader, Shunn "Spider Eyes" Shurreth (see "Shunn Shurreth" below), gather around a campfire in the middle of the hall. Two Intellect Devourer have taken residence in the skulls of two Xanathar Guild members. The creatures use their Detect Sentience trait to telepathically detect intelligent creatures approaching.

Shunn and his thugs can't be surprised if the intellect devourers sense intruders approaching. If an intellect devourer's host is killed, it tries to find another.

##### Shunn Shurreth

A drow priestess of Lolth placed a curse on Shunn and forced him into exile after he displeased her. The curse partially transformed him into a spider, giving him eight red arachnid eyes, a mouth full of fangs, and black bristles sprouting from his slender limbs. A <wc-fetch type="spell">remove curse</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="spell">greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell restores Shunn's natural form, but Shunn doesn't want the curse lifted. His horrific appearance strikes fear into the hearts of his comrades-in-arms and has earned him favor with Xanathar. Shunn believes that returning to his normal form might weaken his influence over his gang and diminish his status in the Xanathar Guild.

Shunn is a drow elite warrior, with these changes:

- Shunn is lawful evil.
- While cursed with spider features, he can climb difficult surfaces, even across ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Shunn moves and converses with an eerie grace and prefers diplomacy over violence when dealing with adventurers. If the characters seem interested in a truce, Shunn offers them 50 gp if they find the wererats that are troubling his gang and return the stone key that they stole. Shunn's gang found the stone key on this level of Undermountain and is still searching for the lock that it fits into.

If he or his thugs are attacked, Shunn Shurreth calls for bugbear reinforcements from **area area 9d**. Shunn's goal in any conflict is to capture his enemies and haul them to Skullport as trophies. Once there, the prisoners are brought to Skull Island and left to the tender mercies of Commander Sundeth (see "Skullport").

##### Supplies

The barrels and crates here contain enough water and dry food to sustain a single person for 600 days or Shunn's gang for 30 days.

##### Treasure

The thugs carry a total of 14 gp in coin. On a black cord around his neck, Shunn wears a silver key (5 gp) that unlocks the silver-bound chest in **area area 9c**.

#### 9c. Gang's Treasure

> **Barrels**. Stone racks spanning the walls contain barrels that are so rotted and old that they fall apart when handled. (The ale and water once stored in them have long since evaporated.)
> 
> **Table and Chest**. A large stone table in the middle of the room is draped with cobwebs. A silver-bound wooden chest rests atop it.

##### Treasure

The chest has a built-in lock that Shunn Shurreth's silver key opens. The lock can also be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The chest contains 100 gp, which Shunn uses to pay his gang.

#### 9d. Bugbear Barracks

Ten bugbear sleep on the dusty floor of this room. They investigate any commotion they hear in **area area 9b**.

### 10. Ooze Temple

These four rooms comprise a temple devoted to water and oozes. All doors leading to these rooms are decorated with symbols of water, and each door forms an airtight seal when shut.

#### 10a. Skull in the Cube

> **Clean**. This 30-foot-high room is swept clean, with no trace of dust or debris.
> 
> **Frescoes**. The walls are carved with frescoes depicting horrific cyclopean cities of black stone submerged beneath raging seas.
> 
> **Giant Ooze**. A gelatinous cube measuring 30 feet on a side is trapped in the room. The monster is situated in the northeast corner when the characters first arrive. Floating in the center of it is a dwarven skull sheathed in glass. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check can tell that the skull is suspended in an enormous gelatinous cube, not levitating.

A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the skull, which belonged to a duergar. Halaster preserved within the skull the duergar's magical ability to enlarge itself. The skull now has the power to enlarge the gelatinous cube, and the skull's glassy coating protects it from the cube's digestive acid. Removing the skull from the gelatinous cube causes the cube to shrink to its normal size (10 feet on a side). The skull has no magical properties other than its ability to enlarge gelatinous cubes (and potentially other oozes, at your discretion).

While enlarged by the duergar skull, the gelatinous cube has the following modified statistics:

- The cube is Gargantuan and can hold up to nine Large creatures or up to thirty-six Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.
- It can make up to four Pseudopod attacks on its turn, and it makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage.
- When the cube shrinks back to normal size, any creatures that it can no longer contain are expelled into unoccupied spaces around it.

#### 10b. Flooded Room

This laboratory, with a 20-foot-high ceiling, is completely filled with 24,000 cubic feet of salt water created by a spell gone awry. Opening the door causes the water to empty into **area area 10a**. Creatures within 20 feet of the opened door are caught in the deluge and must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw is knocked <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch> and takes 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage.

Once the water is released, it fills both rooms to a depth of half an inch. Swept into **area area 10a** with the water is the putrid, rotting corpse of a human wizard in green and purple robes. This is what remains of Salamanth, one of Halaster's more foolish apprentices.

##### Treasure

A search of the room reveals overturned tables, waterlogged books destroyed by salt water, and a glass wand (the dead wizard's arcane focus), which is worth 25 gp.

#### 10c. Altar to Juiblex

> **False Altar**. In the middle of this 20-foot-high room is a limestone altar topped with a misshapen mound of gold that looks like it was poured on the altar in molten form and left there until it cooled and hardened. (The mound of gold is an ochre jelly of unusual color trapped in magical stasis.)
> 
> **Wall Carvings**. Black mildew drips from lidless eyes and gaping mouths carved into the walls. (The wall carvings represent the all-consuming demon lord Juiblex. Though ghastly, the depictions are harmless.)

Close examination of the altar reveals that it bears an inscription in Abyssal that reads, "A gift of flesh, willingly given, can feed our eternal hunger." A character who inspects this "mound of gold" can ascertain its true nature with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Nature</wc-fetch>) check. A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the ochre jelly, suggesting the presence of the stasis field.

The stasis field immobilizes the ooze but also renders it impervious to damage. This magic is dispelled when it comes into contact with flesh or is targeted by a successful <wc-fetch type="spell">dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 17). Freed from its stasis, the ochre jelly attacks.

#### 10d. Caved-In Room

This room has partially caved in, but someone has bored tunnels through the collapsed sections, granting access to dungeon hallways south and east of here. The floor is covered with dust and debris, but the room contains nothing of interest.

### 11. Midna's Lair

An apprentice of Halaster's claimed this area as her own work space centuries ago, using her mastery of the <wc-fetch type="spell">unseen servant</wc-fetch> spell to create multiple <wc-fetch type="condition">invisible</wc-fetch> helpers. Even after her death, her unseen servants persisted, waiting for her to return. Midna Tauberth, one of the Fine Fellows of Daggerford, recently intruded upon this hall and is using it as a rest area.

#### 11a. Hall of Degeneration

The walls of this passage are painted with images of wizards succumbing to madness and being transformed into nothics. One particularly vivid image shows shafts of eerie green light exploding out of a spellbook and changing a wizard into a gibbering mouther.

#### 11b. Master of the Unseen

Flickering torchlight created by <wc-fetch type="spell">continual flame</wc-fetch> spells spills out of this room into the hall. The 15-foot-high vaulted chamber contains the following:

> **Light**. Freestanding iron torch sconces in the four corners of the room have <wc-fetch type="spell">continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast upon them.
> 
> **Midna**. Midna Tauberth (NE female human priest of Shar) relaxes in one of several overstuffed chairs in the middle of the room, waited on by nine Living Unseen Servant (see appendix A). Around her neck, she wears two holy symbols: one shaped like a gold coin (the symbol of Waukeen, god of trade), the other a black disk outlined in purple (the symbol of Shar, god of darkness and loss).
> 
> **Furnishings**. Empty bookshelves and desks line the walls. Against the south wall stands a long banquet table bearing fresh foodstuffs on copper platters and copper flagons filled to the brim with wine. A portrait of a smiling Halaster hangs above the table.

Each day at dawn, the platters and flagons on the table are mystically replenished with fresh food and wine, courtesy of Halaster's magic. The effect produces enough food and wine for twelve people. The magic persists as long as the table remains in this room and there is dishware capable of containing the bounty.

##### Midna Tauberth

Midna isn't interested in sharing her newfound lair with others. She advises characters to leave or face the wrath of her <wc-fetch type="condition">invisible</wc-fetch> servants. If they don't leave at once, she orders the servants to beat them senseless. If the servants seem to be losing the fight, she calls them off and, in the interest of self-preservation, apologizes for her boorishness and allows the newcomers to partake of the food and wine on the table.

If Halleth the revenant (see **area level 1, area 37**) is present, he tries to kill Midna and reclaim his holy symbol of Waukeen. Midna stole it from Halleth's corpse and shrinks away from his revenant while commanding the living unseen servants to defend her. If Midna is slain and the holy symbol of Waukeen is returned to Halleth, the revenant's thirst for vengeance abates, and both it and the holy symbol turn to dust.

##### Living Unseen Servants

The unseen servants obey Midna's commands because she reminds them of their creator. They follow Midna and can leave the room to fulfill her wishes. Midna has no way to distinguish one servant from another, meaning that when she utters a command, all the servants follow that command. She can't issue orders to a single servant without the others performing the same task.

##### Treasure

Midna's holy symbol of Shar is a small disk carved from obsidian on a silver chain. The holy symbol of Waukeen is a small gold disk stamped with the god's visage in profile. The holy symbols are worth 25 gp each.

The smiling portrait of Halaster is 3 feet wide and 5 feet tall. It has no magical properties, but is worth 25 gp, though it's awkward to transport.

### 12. Dwarven Tools

These hallways are lined with crumbling stone tables and shelves upon which rest sturdy dwarven anvils, whetstones, tongs, hammers, chisels, and other tools.

#### Arch Gate to Level 5

Embedded in the wall at the end of the westward hallway is an arch gate (see "**area Gates**"). Close inspection reveals the image of a dead tree carved into its keystone. The rules of this gate are as follows:

- Touching the arch with a dead twig or branch causes the gate to open for 1 minute.
- Characters must be 8th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "**area Jhesiyra Kestellharp**"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "**area Elder Runes**").
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in **area area 3b on level 5**, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.

### 13. Mutated Apprentices

Once a dwarven mithral mine, this section of the dungeon is home to apprentices whose attempts to unlock the secrets of the Weave transformed them into gibbering mouthers and nothics.

#### 13a. Dumathoin's Altar

> **Gibbering Mouther**. A gibbering mouther wanders the hall to the east, attacking other creatures on sight.
> 
> **Equipment**. Overturned mine carts and discarded mining equipment lay scattered across the floor.
> 
> **Altar**. A red stone altar covered with small, dirty handprints stands in the northern alcove.

The altar is a 3-foot-tall, 500-pound tapered block of dark red stone engraved with Dwarvish prayers to Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain. Greasy goblin handprints cover the altar, which any dwarf would consider a desecration. Any character who takes the time to clean the altar gains the following magical boon: all secret doors are plainly visible to that character for the next 24 hours. A character who willfully desecrates the altar and then cleans it doesn't gain this boon. (Dwarven gods are not very forgiving.)

##### Treasure

Beneath one of the overturned mine carts are four chunks of mithral ore, each worth 25 gp and weighing 10 pounds.

#### 13b. Wall of Rust and Bones

Bisecting this room is an 8-foot-high, 2-foot-thick wall of hobgoblin skeletons and rusty armor, with a 2-foot gap between the top of the wall and the ceiling. A Tiny creature can pass through narrow openings in the wall. Climbing over the wall requires a successful DC 12 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. The wall can be easily broken apart or pushed down, but doing so creates a lot of clatter and summons the nothics from **area area 13e**.

#### 13câ€“13d. Vacant Washrooms

Inside each of these rooms is a rusted water pump (inoperable), basins, and stone toilets separated by thin slate dividers.

#### 13e. "Nothic to See Here!"

An <wc-fetch type="spell">arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell has been cast on the western door. Rizzeryl the drow mage (see **area area 14**) can pass through the portal. Other creatures must force the door open with a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

> **Nothics**. Four Nothic lurk here (see below).
> 
> **Equipment**. Low-lying stone shelves along the walls are stuffed with crumbling pairs of dwarven boots. Rusty dwarven helmets and dusty goggles with tattered leather straps hang on pegs above them.

The nothics are insane and attack most creatures they encounter. They are easily and quickly cowed by displays of magic, however. Once they realize they're in the presence of one or more spellcasters, the nothics become slightly more cooperative. They know that several bipedal rat creatures are holed up on the other side of the western door, and that their master is a "purple-skinned elf wizard with red eyes and white hair."

#### 13f. Gibbering Mine

The walls in this partially collapsed section of the dungeon are streaked with veins of copper. Three Gibbering Mouther have gathered here and begin to jabber as other creatures approach. They fight until killed.

#### 13g. Strike it Rich

The characters hear sounds of battle as they traverse the hall leading to this 10-foot-high room, which has partially collapsed and contains the following:

> **Light**. The room is lit by a single lantern resting in the middle of the floor.
> 
> **Equipment**. Mine carts about the room contain glittering heaps of copper ore.
> 
> **Battle**. A wounded warrior named Rex the Hammer (LE male Illuskan human champion with 22 hit points remaining; see appendix A) has been backed into the southeast corner by a vicious mezzoloth and two Nothic. Three dead nothics (killed by Rex) lie on the floor near them.

The mezzoloth was summoned and bound to Undermountain by Halaster. Its task is to prevent intruders from looting the dungeon. It uses telepathy to command the nothics, which serve it out of fear.

##### Rex the Hammer

Rex was the founder and leader of the evil adventuring party known as the Fine Fellows of Daggerford. Despite hearing rumors about the dangers of Undermountain, Rex assumed (based on the success of Durnan and other capable explorers) that the Fine Fellows would run roughshod over the monsters dwelling within. Boy, was he wrong. Like most villainous groups, the Fine Fellows lacked cohesion. Fed up with his companions' bickering, Rex struck off on his own. He was searching this room for loot when the mezzoloth and the nothics came in behind him, cutting off his escape.

If the characters come to his rescue, Rex expresses his gratitude before quaffing the healing potion in his backpack (see "Treasure" below). On the surface, he seems to be amiable, confident, and eager to discover Undermountain's secrets. He's happy to join the party for an equal share of any loot found. Once he's back at full health (or close to it), though, Rex sheds his civil veneer and tries to bully the characters into following his orders, berating and threatening anyone who defies him. The bullying gets worse until Rex is forcibly ousted or the party dissolves.

##### Treasure

Rex's backpack lies next to one of the mine carts. It contains a silvered shortsword, a 30-foot-long coil of hempen rope, 2 days of rations, a flask of oil, a pouch containing 13 gp, and a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>. The oil lantern in the middle of the room belongs to Rex as well.

The mine carts contain over a thousand chunks of copper ore, each weighing 10 pounds and worth 1 gp. The carts are so old that their axles are bent and rusted, rendering them inoperable.

### 14. Base de RÃ©sistance

These two chambers have been claimed by a drow mage named Rizzeryl, his summoned quasit minion, and eight wererats. At least for now, Rizzeryl and the wererats are staunch allies.

Rizzeryl works for two groups: House Auvryndar, a low-ranking drow house from Menzoberranzan that is slowly and secretly consolidating its power in Undermountain, and the Zhentarim, which is trying to drive the Xanathar Guild out of Skullport. His ties to the Black Network make Rizzeryl an enemy of the Xanathar Guild, which currently controls Skullport and is trying to secure the uppermost levels of Undermountain.

Rizzeryl has begun haranguing the Xanathar Guild forces on this level with the help of the wererat gang, which hails from Skullport. The drow wizard and the wererats have no quarrel with adventurers who leave them alone.

#### 14a. Rizzeryl's Hideout

The door to this room has a mural painted on the outside depicting a darkmantle descending on an unsuspecting dwarf who is admiring a gleaming gemstone. An <wc-fetch type="spell">arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell has been cast on the door. Rizzeryl the drow mage and his wererat gang can pass through the door, while other creatures must force it open with magic or a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

The room contains the following:

> **Drow**. Rizzeryl the drow mage sits on a chair in the southwest corner while resting in a trance. If he hears someone coming through the eastern door, he casts <wc-fetch type="spell">greater invisibility</wc-fetch> on himself.
> 
> **Table**. A wooden table in the center of the room bears a map made of loose stones arranged to form walls and doors (see "Tabletop Map" below).

Rizzeryl likes to be <wc-fetch type="condition">invisible</wc-fetch> as he engages intruders in conversation, hoping to learn their intentions. Any noise here alerts the wererats in **area area 14b**, who remain hidden until Rizzeryl calls for them.

Rizzeryl offers the adventurers a reward if they destroy both Xanathar Guild outposts on this level (**area areas 9** and **area 20**) and return with the heads of both guild leaders, whose names, he tells them, are Nadia the Unbent and Shunn Shurreth. Rizzeryl doesn't reveal the nature of the reward, other than to say it will make the party's exploration of Undermountain easier. If the characters deliver the heads of Nadia and Shunn, Rizzeryl gives them a stone key hidden in this room (see "Secret Compartment" below). If the characters attack him, Rizzeryl calls forth the wererats to defend him while he summons a quasit. If the adventurers overcome these forces, Rizzeryl trades the stone key for his life.

Rizzeryl knows the way to Skullport through level 3 and might share this information with friendly adventurers who have helped him. He refrains from divulging his allegiance to House Auvryndar. He will, however, reveal his allegiance to the Zhentarim if one or more characters identify themselves as members of that faction. If they need assistance, Rizzeryl urges such characters to seek out Bosskyn Gorrb, a tiefling member of the Black Network who operates in Skullport. Rizzeryl also informs them that servants of Xanathar will allow safe passage to anyone who openly brandishes Xanathar's symbol (see below).

##### Secret Compartment

Beneath Rizzeryl's chair is a loose floor tile that conceals a hidden compartment, which can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check. It contains three items: Rizzeryl's leather-bound spellbook (which holds the spells he has prepared, plus <wc-fetch type="spell">arcane lock</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type="spell">sending</wc-fetch>), a 12-inch-long stone key, a 12-inch-long driftwood wand with the symbol of Xanathar (a circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its circumference) carved at one end. Rizzeryl uses this nonmagical wand to slip past the guardian in **area area 20a** and to move through Skullport unmolested.

The stone key weighs 10 pounds and bears the following inscription in Dwarvish: "Meet me on the Lost Level. Find my twin in Slitherswamp." A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the key, which opens a magic gate that connects levels 6 and 8 of Undermountain (see **area level 6, area 34b**, and **area level 8, area 3**, for more information on each gate). Rizzeryl knows that levels 6 and 8 of Undermountain are called the Lost Level and Slitherswamp, respectively, but he hasn't explored either level.

##### Tabletop Map

The wererats have carefully arranged the loose stones on the table to form an accurate map of this level of Undermountain; the map, however, omits the chambers hidden behind secret doors (**area areas 5**, **area 20c**, **area 20d**, **area 22e**, **area 22f**, **area 25h**, and **area 26b**). There's no easy way to transport this map without knocking the stones out of alignment and rendering the map useless.

#### 14b. Wererat Barracks

Eight Wererat in human form sleep on dirty cots in this room. They are loyal to the Zhentarim and determined to push the Xanathar Guild out of Skullport and Undermountain.

The wererats are short, unkempt humans of mixed age with thin limbs, beady eyes, and nervous tics. They clad themselves in filthy, smelly, ill-fitting clothes. Their leader is a crass, middle-aged woman named Zilitsa Ilvarren. She is mean-spirited but has a good rapport with Rizzeryl, whose intelligence she admires. The others are a degenerate bunch of inbred, light-fearing weirdos who've spent too many years living underground. The men are named Frek, Henk, and Kozrik, and the women are Arreth, Elabbor, Kreena, and Sybilee.

##### Treasure

An unlocked wooden chest against the south wall holds 30 gp, a copper tankard similar to those found in **area area 22a** (5 gp), a battered and tarnished silver scepter topped with a Dwarvish rune meaning "justice" (25 gp), and three worthless, dog-eared chapbooks entitled _Out of the Inferno, Vols. 1, 2, and 3_ (a tawdry series about a tiefling romance).

### 15. Dusty Throne

> **Ruins**. Much of this room collapsed long ago, and what remains is covered with dust.
> 
> **Footprints**. Footprints (left by wererats in human form) crisscross the dusty floor.
> 
> **Throne:** A plain stone throne stands against the south wall. Beyond it, heaps of rubble fill a collapsed tunnel.

A search of the throne and the surrounding room yields nothing of value. The wererats in **area area 14** have already searched the area thoroughly.

### 16. Partially Collapsed Room

The back of this room has collapsed, filling the chamber with dust and debris. No one has been here in ages, and nothing of value remains.

### 17. Hungry Rust Monsters

This old festival hall has an arched ceiling 30 feet high and contains the following:

> **Rust Monsters**. Two Rust Monster are fighting over a rusted steel helmet in the middle of this room, casting it about as they knock each other around.
> 
> **Wall Decor**. The walls are decorated with bas-reliefs of dwarves singing and drinking. A dozen empty iron torch brackets are mounted to the north and south walls at 10-foot intervals.

The rust monsters can't find enough ferrous metal to satisfy their hunger. The helm provides a momentary distraction that characters can use to cross the hall safely after they first arrive. The next time they come here, though, the rust monsters are waiting for them.

The torch brackets bolted to the walls are beyond the rust monsters' reach but make irresistible snacks if fed to the creatures. Tearing loose a torch bracket requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. One bracket is enough to distract the rust monsters for <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> minutes.

### 18. Cold Storage

The Melairkyn dwarves used this chamber for cold storage. Halaster has turned it into a trap. The room has the following features:

> **Cold**. The room is bitterly cold.
> 
> **Glowing Rune**. The walls rise 10 feet, then angle inward, forming a pyramidal roof with a 40-foot-high apex. Inscribed on the sloped north wall is a 10-foot-tall Dwarvish rune that glows with a faint blue light.

Any character who understands Dwarvish knows that the oversized rune on the north wall is an ancient symbol meaning "cold." A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the rune. The rune's magic lowers the room's temperature to 0 degrees Fahrenheit.

When a spell is cast in this room (including one cast from a magic item), the giant rune flashes and deals 36 (<wc-roll>8d8</wc-roll>) cold damage to all creatures in the room. Once the rune has released this cold energy, it can't do so again for 1 hour.

### 19. Giant Spider Den

Giant spiders make their home here despite countless attempts by adventurers to get rid of them.

#### 19a. Arachnid Down

> **Clutter**. Narrow paths wind between scattered piles of broken furniture and garbage.
> 
> **Chandeliers**. Two iron chandeliers, once anchored to the 20-foot-high ceiling, have fallenâ€”their ropes cut. One has crashed into a pile of debris. Pinned beneath the other chandelier is a dead giant spider.

#### 19b. Old Bedchamber

> **Dead Spider**. A dead giant spider, its body shot full of arrows and scorched by fire, lies next to a broken wooden bed against the east wall.
> 
> **Armoire**. Standing against the south wall is a wooden armoire draped in cobwebs.

##### Treasure

The armoire contains the skeletal remains of a halfling adventurer who was trapped inside by giant spiders and starved to death. The skeleton is clad in a chain shirt and wears a <wc-fetch type="item">ring of swimming</wc-fetch> on one bony finger. Characters who search the armoire also find an explorer's pack (minus water and rations).

#### 19c. Sticky Webs

This room is full of thick, sticky webs (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The webbing stretches all the way to **area areas 19d** and **area 19e**.

Any tugging or burning of the webs in this area alerts the giant spiders in **area area 19d**, which creep down the hallway to investigate.

#### 19d. Spider Warren

Five Giant Spider lair here and attack all intruders.

#### 19e. Spider Larder

Dense webbing fills this room as well (see **area area 19c** that bursts forth and attacks if the cocoon is torn open.

##### Treasure

The dead nothic has no treasure. A thorough search of the goblin corpses yields 20 cp, 18 sp, 5 gp, and a silvered dagger.

### 20. Dead Eyes Watch Post

The Xanathar Guild forces stationed here include five human thugs, eight bugbears, and their leader, Nadia the Unbent. A beholder zombie provides added security.

#### 20a. Beholder Zombie

> **Watcher**. A beholder zombie floats near the 20-foot-high ceiling of this chamber, out of melee range. Painted in white around its central eye is a circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its circumference (Xanathar's symbol).
> 
> **Noise**. Sounds of mock battle emanate from the tunnel to the west (leading to **area area 20b**).

The beholder zombie attacks anyone who enters the room without brandishing or wearing the symbol of Xanathar. Combat in this room brings reinforcements from **area area 20b**.

#### 20b. Watch Post Barracks

> **Xanathar Guild**. Unless they are drawn to **area area 20a** by sounds of combat, the following creatures are training here: a 7-foot-tall, powerfully built woman with shaggy black hair and pale skin named Nadia the Unbent (NE female Illuskan berserker), five human Thug (three women and two men), and five Bugbear.
> 
> **Blood Circle**. Painted in blood on the middle of the floor is a 10-foot-diameter circle with ten equidistant spokes extending outward from its circumference (Xanathar's symbol).
> 
> **Hammocks**. Fifteen leather hammocks are hooked to stone brackets that protrude from the walls at regular intervals.
> 
> **Secret Door**. A secret door in the west wall leads to **area area 20c**.

If she's here, Nadia the Unbent stands in the middle of the bloody circle, armed with a 10-foot-pole, and is using it to knock about her underlings in a contest to see who, if anyone, can push her out of the circle. Nadia relishes any opportunity to fight and kill, and she hurls herself and her forces into battle without a second thought.

#### 20c. Arch Gate to Level 6

This hallway has three alcoves:

- The two southernmost alcoves contain secret doors to **area areas 20b** and **area 20d**, respectively.
- The alcove to the north has an arch embedded in its back wall. Carved into the arch's keystone is an image of a rust monster.

##### Arch Gate

The arch is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "**area Gates**"). The Xanathar Guild forces nearby are aware of the gate but don't know how to activate it. Its rules are as follows:

- Touching the arch with a nonmagical item made entirely of ferrous metal (such as an iron spike) reduces the item to powdered rust and opens the gate for 1 minute.
- Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "**area Jhesiyra Kestellharp**"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "**area Elder Runes**").
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in **area area 24 on level 6**, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.

#### 20d. Secret Armory

This 20-foot-high room is hidden behind a secret door and contains the following:

> **Bugbears**. Three Bugbear have broken away from the main group in **area area 20b** to search this room for treasure. They have worked their way to the east end of the room and aren't expecting trouble.
> 
> **Racks**. Weapon and armor racks stand like library bookshelves in the middle of the room, with dusty, web-filled aisles between them.
> 
> **Sharpening Wheel**. Half embedded in the floor in the middle of the room is a 1-foot-thick, 6-foot-diameter stone sharpening wheel. A stone pedal next to the wheel causes it to turn when stepped on.

One of the bugbears is rummaging through a collection of dwarven morningstars and casting undesirable ones onto the floor. The other two are fighting over a rusty shield embossed with a symbol resembling a stylized goblin skull.

The room contains dozens of suits of plate armor, scale armor, and chain mail, as well as scores of shields, battleaxes, morningstars, warhammers, war picks, and javelins. Most of these items have deteriorated to the point of being useless and irreparable. Rust has eaten away the metal, and dampness has rotted the leather straps and bindings on the shields and armor.

### 21. Animated Ballistae

> **Light**. The arched, 30-foot-high ceiling of this long hall is studded with glowing red crystals that cast dim light throughout the hall. (Crystals pried out of their fixtures go dark.)
> 
> **Animated Ballistae**. Parked in front of the door to **area area 22a** are two animated ballistae.

Each animated ballista is a Large wood-and-iron construct with AC 15, 50 hit points, a walking speed of 30 feet, immunity to poison damage, and the following ability scores: Strength 14, Dexterity 10, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. It has <wc-fetch type="sense">blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 120 feet and is blind beyond this distance. It can't be <wc-fetch type="condition">blinded</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="condition">charmed</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="condition">deafened</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="condition">frightened</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="condition">paralyzed</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type="condition">poisoned</wc-fetch>, and it can't right itself if knocked <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch>. As an action, it can fire a magic bolt of fire (+6 to hit) at a target it can perceive, dealing 16 (<wc-roll>3d10</wc-roll>) fire damage on a hit, but it can't attack any creature directly above it. Treat each ballista as a monster with a challenge rating of 2 (450 XP).

The ballistae can't perceive (and thus they ignore) creatures that keep to the easternmost 60-foot section of the hallway. Once they detect intruders, however, the ballistae amble forward on hinged legs to close the distance. If a ballista has nothing to attack on its turn, it returns to its starting position.

### 22. Garrux's Brewery

This complex was built by a dwarf named Garrux, who served as Master of Ale and Provisions for the Melairkyn dwarves.

#### 22a. Ale Dispenser

> **Pillar**. A stone pillar in the middle of the room has a ring of six copper spigots jutting out of it, 3 feet above the floor.
> 
> **Bas-Reliefs**. Carved into the walls are twenty bas-reliefs depicting drunken dwarves in different poses. One hand of each dwarf protrudes from the wall. Three of these hands grasp copper tankards.

The stone pillar has copper pipes running through it. These pipes connect to the vats in **area area 22c**. When the brewery was operational, dwarves could draw ale from the pillar into tankards to quench their thirst.

Nothing happens if five of the six spigots are turned. Turning the sixth spigot causes a patch of green slime (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) to pour out of it.

##### Treasure

There used to be twenty copper tankards secured to the wall carvings, but most of them have vanished over the years. (One can be found in **area area 14b**.) The three remaining tankards are worth 5 gp each.

#### 22b. "Brewers Only!"

Nestled between **area areas 22a** and **area 22c** is a 10-foot-high, 10-foot-square room. A brass plaque bolted to the western door has the following words stamped into it in Dwarvish: "BREWERS ONLY! Others keep out! By order of Garrux, Master of Ale and Provisions."

#### 22c. Ale Vats

> **Vats**. Six stone vats, arranged in two rows of three, dominate this 20-foot-high room.
> 
> **Doors and Barrels**. A double door in the west wall has stacks of old barrels on both sides of it (see "Barrels" below). The doors are painted with images of two dwarves in profile, facing each other while standing on sideways barrels.

The Melairkyn dwarves stored ale in these vats. Each vat is a hollow, slightly bulging stone cylinder 10 feet high and 10 feet in diameter, with 6-inch-thick walls. A copper spigot is embedded in the vats on the side facing the nearest wall, at a height of 3 feet. A narrow stone staircase curls up the exterior of each vat to the top, which is fitted with a hinged copper lid. The vats' interiors are lined with copper and have a pipe at the bottom that runs under the floor to the ale dispenser in **area area 22a**.

Four of the vats are empty, their contents having long since evaporated or been depleted. The southwest vat contains a beholder zombie, which rises out of the vat and attacks if disturbed.

##### Barrels

There are thirty empty barrels, all made of iron-banded zurkhwood (a woody fungus). Most are in such poor condition that they can no longer hold liquids without leaking, but clever characters can use them to safely avoid the pit traps in **area area 22d**.

#### 22d. Barrel Run

Beyond a 10-foot landing, this hall gradually slopes down toward the west.

Secret doors at the west end of the hall open into **area areas 22e** and **area 22f**, respectively. Dwarves used to fill barrels of ale and roll them down this hall to be stored in the secret chambers.

##### Pit Traps

The Melairkyn dwarves built three 20-foot-deep pits in the sloped floor to guard their ale supplies. The pits' covers blend in with the surrounding floor, though a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check detects each pit.

When a creature weighing 50 pounds or more steps on a pit's cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the creature to spill into the pit below and take <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> bludgeoning damage from the fall. The lid is spring-loaded and snaps closed after the creature falls through. A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the lid open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see in the dark.

Wedging at least two iron spikes between the pit's lid and the surrounding floor prevents the lid from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The lid can also be magically held shut with an <wc-fetch type="spell">arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. The dwarves constructed the pit covers so that they won't open if an object is rolled over them. A character can circumvent the traps by climbing into an empty barrel and rolling down the hall or climbing onto a barrel and balancing atop it as it rolls down the hall. Balancing atop a barrel as it careens down the hall requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check.

#### 22e. North Ale Storage

This chamber is hidden behind a secret door.

The room's walls climb 10 feet, then angle inward to form a pyramidal cap with a 30-foot-high apex. Stacked in the middle of the room are one hundred forty zurkhwood barrels banded in iron. The barrels form a 21-foot-high pyramid with a base measuring seven barrels on a side. Engraved on the lid of each barrel is a magical glyph that radiates an aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell.

##### Treasure

Each barrel contains 40 gallons of dwarven ale that has been magically preserved for centuries. Removing a barrel's lid or breaking the barrel causes its glyph to fade away, ending the preservation spell on that barrel. If the ale is marketed as "Melairkyn Ale," "Undermountain Ale," or something similar, characters can sell a barrel of it for 40 gp in Waterdeep. A full barrel of ale weighs approximately 400 pounds.

#### 22f. South Ale Storage

This room is identical to **area area 22e**, except the pyramid of barrels has collapsed. Most of the barrels lie smashed on the floor. Fifty-nine of them remain intact, their ale preserved. Another three appear to be intact but are, in fact, three Mimic placed here by Halaster. The three hide within 10 feet of one another and fight together.

### 23. Ruined Dwarven Temple

These rooms once formed a temple dedicated to the dwarven god Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain, but Halaster has destroyed and replaced most of their original contents.

#### 23a. Defaced Dwarves

![undefined](adventure/WDMM/007-204.png)

> **Light**. The walls climb 15 feet, then angle inward to create a peaked, 30-foot-high ceiling. The sloped upper walls have red glowing crystals set into them. These crystals fill the hall with dim light. (Crystals pried out of their fixtures go dark.)
> 
> **Carvings**. The lower walls were once lined with carvings depicting dwarves pushing mine carts toward the west, but these works have been defaced and, in some cases, replaced with stony tentacles that protrude from the walls.
> 
> **Dwarf-Guarded Doors**. A 20-foot-tall double door stands closed at the west end of the hall. Carved into the walls flanking the double door stand armored dwarves, their stony beards flowing out of great helms that conceal their facial features.

Halaster used magic to distort the wall carvings almost beyond recognition and to create tentacle-like protrusions that weren't part of the original design. These tentacles writhe as creatures pass by themâ€”a harmless effect created by the Mad Mage.

#### 23b. Hall of Dead Dragons

> **Ceiling**. The 30-foot-high vaulted ceiling of this room is supported every 20 feet or so by thick stone arches.
> 
> **Skeletal Displays**. Standing in the hall are the skeletons of four Huge dragons, their bones held together by wire and cement. A few pieces of each dragon have broken off and fallen to the floor. A fifth dragon skeleton in a similar state of disrepair fills an alcove to the south.

This hall contains the posed, inanimate skeletons of five adult dragonsâ€”one each of brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver. The gold dragon skeleton occupies the southern alcove, while the others are lined up in the main hall. The skeletons are harmless.

### 24. Dead Adventurer

What was once a dwarven shrine is now the tomb of a long-dead adventurer.

Splayed across a broken stone bench in the middle of the room are the skeletal remains of a tiefling clad in rotted leather armor. The skeleton clutches a quarterstaff that has become brittle with age. A tattered backpack contains adventuring gear that has rotted or rusted away.

Casting a <wc-fetch type="spell">speak with dead</wc-fetch> spell on the skeleton reveals that the tiefling, Savir, was a monk who fell prey to a cloaker. Savir's spirit doesn't know what became of his adventuring companions or the cloaker. If questioned about Undermountain, Savir's spirit reveals that there's an elven tomb nearby with a secret door in the north wall that neither he nor his companions could open. (The spirit is referring to **area area 26a** but doesn't remember how to get there.)

### 25. Creature Storage

Halaster uses these chambers as a storage facility for creatures that he has captured and <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch>. He restores them to flesh using the elven magic in **area area 25a**.

#### 25a. Caryatids of Restoration

> **Caryatids**. Supporting the 20-foot-high ceiling are four pillars of white marble, each shaped in the likeness of a stoic female elf in flowing robes with a flowering branch clutched to her chest. The caryatids face inward.
> 
> **Modron**. Circling the caryatids counterclockwise is a quadrone with its bow at the ready. It makes clicking and clacking noises as it walks.
> 
> **Bas-Reliefs:** The walls are carved with bas-reliefs of unicorns and bare-branched trees.

A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the pillars. Touching a pillar while speaking the proper command phrase ("Elf magic!") causes a pale light to fill the area between the four pillars, ending the following conditions on a creature in that area: <wc-fetch type="condition">blinded</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="condition">deafened</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="condition">poisoned</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="condition">stunned</wc-fetch>. This magical effect can be activated four times, once for each pillar touched. The pillars regain their magic at the next dawn.

The caryatids lose their magic if even one is destroyed or toppled. A caryatid has AC 17, 90 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It can be toppled with a successful DC 30 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

##### Quadrone

Halaster found this rogue modron, decided to adopt it, and gave it a name: Halastron. The modron considers Halaster its friend and follows his orders to the best of its ability. Its orders are as follows:

- Remember its name.
- Defend itself.
- Attack anything that tries to damage or topple the caryatids.
- Walk in a counterclockwise circle around the caryatids when not defending itself or the pillars.

The quadrone speaks and understands the Modron language only. It knows that the caryatids can restore <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch> creatures to flesh, having seen them in action, and it has heard Halaster speak the command phrase to activate the caryatids. Its instructions don't prevent it from communicating with strangers or sharing information with them. It knows almost nothing about Undermountain and disintegrates if reduced to 0 hit points.

#### 25bâ€“25r. Lifelike Statues

Stored here are creatures that have been turned to stone by Halaster, as summarized in the Petrified Creatures table. Each can be restored to flesh with a <wc-fetch type="spell">greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. A restored creature acts in accordance with its nature. For example, the grick in **area area 25b** is likely to attack all other creatures out of hunger. When Halaster wants to restore a <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch> creature to flesh, he uses a <wc-fetch type="spell">telekinesis</wc-fetch> spell to transport it to **area area 25a**, then relies on the magic of the pillars there.

##### Area 25h

This room is hidden behind a secret door and contains a lifelike statue of Halaster. Casting a <wc-fetch type="spell">greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell on the statue or subjecting it to the magic of the caryatids in **area area 25a** triggers a <wc-fetch type="spell">magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell cast on the statue that says, "Fools!"

##### Area 25m

If you expand the dungeon to the south, an illusory wall behind the <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch> mind flayer conceals a tunnel beyond. The illusory wall has no substance, allowing creatures to pass right through it.

##### Area 25r

The <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch> wererat looks like a statue of a wiry young man grasping a shortsword. This wererat is not part of Rizzeryl's gang (see **area area 14**) but tries to join it if given the chance. His name is Zarn Kassifax.

###### Petrified Creatures

| Area | Creature(s) |
| - | - |
| 25b | 4 Bullywug |
| 25c | 3 Grick |
| 25d | 2 drow |
| 25e | 4 Rust Monster |
| 25f | 5 Troglodyte |
| 25g | 6 Goat |
| 25i | 1 boar |
| 25j | 1 constrictor snake |
| 25k | 1 kenku |
| 25l | 1 lizardfolk |
| 25m | 1 mind flayer |
| 25n | 1 nothic |
| 25o | 1 orc war chief |
| 25p | 1 giant badger |
| 25q | 1 quaggoth |
| 25r | 1 wererat (human form) |

### 26. Ancient Elven Tomb

These chambers are much older than the dwarf-hewn chambers that surround them, as evidenced by the crumbling walls, the slanted floors, and the thin streams of dust pouring down through cracks in the sagging ceiling. Halaster converted this tomb for the elven dead into a series of test chambers that now lie abandoned.

#### 26a. Do Not Feed the Owlbears!

> **Owlbears**. Two Owlbear left here by Halaster are hungry and attack anything that enters this room.
> 
> **Sarcophagi**. A dozen elven sarcophagi arranged about this dusty room have been reduced to rubble.
> 
> **Carvings**. Time and neglect have all but destroyed wall carvings that depict elves mounted on elk, parading through a forest as the seasons change around them.
> 
> **Secret Door**. A secret door in the north wall leads to **area area 26b**.

##### Treasure

Characters who search the room for treasure find a 10-pound clay pot lying amid some rubble near the south wall. The pot is painted with images of a bare-footed elf druid leading a march of small, uprooted shrubs that seem to be walking of their own accord.

A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the pot, which is a common wondrous magic item called a <wc-fetch type="item">pot of awakening</wc-fetch>. If one plants an ordinary shrub in the pot and lets it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an awakened shrub at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it. The awakened shrub is friendly toward whoever planted it. Absent commands from its creator, it does nothing.

#### 26b. Secret Tomb

In the middle of the dusty tomb rests a 7,500-pound alabaster sarcophagus atop a 1-foot-high block of granite. The lid of the sarcophagus is carved in the likeness of a regal elf of indeterminate age and gender, with a yawning cat stretching on the elf's chest. The cat is part of the lid's carving, not a separate sculpture.

A character who inspects the sarcophagus closely and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check realizes that it's a solid block of alabaster with a fake lid carved to appear openableâ€”a false tomb built to confound would-be treasure-hunters.

#### 26c. Halaster's Crushing Eye

> **Destroyed Tables**. Three stone tables lie strewn about the room, surrounded by ceramic shards that were once funerary urns. (The owlbears in **area area 26a** are responsible for the destruction.)
> 
> **Sloped Hall**. A 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high hallway to the south slopes gently upward to **area area 26d** and contains a rolling sphere trap.

The 10-foot-square section of floor marked X on map 2 is a pressure plate. When 20 or more pounds of pressure depress this plate, a 10-foot-diameter stone sphere painted to look like a bloodshot eyeball careens from an alcove at the top of the sloped hallway and down the passage toward **area area 26c**. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check, a character searching the hall for traps can spot the pressure plate. Wedging four or more iron spikes or similar objects under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

When the sphere is released, all creatures present roll initiative, and the sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves in a straight line until it reaches a corner, then changes direction to follow the sloped tunnel until it comes to rest in **area area 26c**. The sphere can move through other creatures' spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's space or a creature enters its space while the sphere is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (<wc-roll>10d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage and be knocked <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch>.

A creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down by using an action to make a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 15 feet. In the sloped hallway, this reduction lasts only until the end of the sphere's next turn. If the sphere's speed drops to 0 on a flat surface, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.

#### 26d. Bloodletting Chamber

This 10-foot-high room holds a row of six slanted stone tables intended for ritualistic bloodletting. Each table is fitted with rusty shackles and leather straps. Under the lower end of each table, set into the floor, is a shallow, circular stone basin for collecting blood.

#### 26e. Abandoned Study

> **Makeshift Desk**. The lid of a stone sarcophagus rests atop two misshapen blocks of stone, creating a makeshift desk at the south end of the room. Behind it is a high-backed chair made of charred wood that has one armrest missing.
> 
> **Wall Niches**. Beyond the desk and chair, dusty books are crammed into niches in the south wall. Similar niches in the other walls contain tall, alabaster funerary urns covered with dust and cobwebs (seventeen in all).

##### Treasure

The alabaster urns are cracked, chipped, and worthless. They contain nothing but dustâ€”for the most part. Buried in the dust inside one of the urns is a tiny white pouch containing <wc-fetch type="item">dust of disappearance</wc-fetch>.

The books cover the subjects of alchemy, dwarven and elven history, engineering, gemcraft, the study of monstrosities, and weather prediction. All of them are falling apart, but stuffed among the mundane tomes is a badly burned wizard's spellbook that still contains the following spells: <wc-fetch type="spell">comprehend languages</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">crown of madness</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">darkvision</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">gaseous form</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">ray of sickness</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">remove curse</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">Tenser's floating disk</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="spell">unseen servant</wc-fetch>.

## Aftermath

If they're weakened but not eradicated, the goblins begin constructing traps around the perimeter of their market to better protect themselves against aggressive adventurers and bad neighbors. They favor <wc-fetch type="trap">collapsing roof</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="trap">falling net</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="trap">poison darts</wc-fetch> (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The goblins also train and deploy giant rats, using them as watchdogs. Some of these might be Rizzeryl's wererats in rat form, sent to infiltrate the goblin lair and spy on adventurers who find their way to the goblin bazaar.

Destroying the two Xanathar Guild outposts allows the goblins to expand their territory. Unless the goblins are also wiped out, goblin patrols become more common throughout this level of the dungeon.
