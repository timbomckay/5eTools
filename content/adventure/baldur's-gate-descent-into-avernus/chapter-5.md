All adventures must end, but the best ones end with a bang. The climax of _Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus_ comes when the characters try to redeem Zariel, save Elturel, or both. This chapter sets out some of the most likely ways for these events to happen. As with all Dungeons  & Dragons adventures, a host of other outcomes are possible, so feel free to let the story evolve beyond the suggested endings outlined in this chapter.

If the characters don't want to save Elturel, they don't need to. However, if they intend to save Elturel, the players should be aware that this is a twofold task:

- Elturel must be freed from the chains that bind it to Avernus.
- Elturel must be returned to the Material Plane.

Though some of the actions the characters can take will accomplish both these tasks at once, others will solve only half the problem.

## Who Should Rule Avernus?

The characters could give Zariel more power to rule Avernus, or they could support one of the archdevil's enemies in a bid to unseat her. They could also try to destroy Zariel, creating a power vacuum that throws Avernus into disarray. Whatever the outcome, the characters are poised to help write cosmic history.

### Redeeming Zariel

In this outcome, the adventurers entreat the archdevil to redeem her angelic soul and take up her celestial mantle once more. Even though Zariel has fallen, there remains a faint glimmer of hope for her salvation. A fragment of the devil's former self still lingers within her sword, but inspiring Zariel to reverse the course of her destiny is not as easy as simply handing her the blade.

#### Presenting the Sword

To redeem Zariel, the characters must possess the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>. Bringing the sword within 10 feet of Zariel causes the weapon to glow brighter, then levitate to hover before her. Confronted with the last fragment of her angelic spark, Zariel faces an internal struggle. In this moment, the characters have a chance to help the archdevil return to the light.

One of the characters must present Zariel with the argument to rejoin the celestial host, then make a DC 25 Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check. If the check is successful, Zariel is convinced to grasp the sword and accept its angelic spark back into her soul. The DC of this check is reduced by 5 for each of the following NPCs that are present when the characters try to redeem Zariel:

**Lulu**. If Lulu is with the characters, the hollyphant regains all of her spellcasting abilities and weeps for what Zariel has become. Zariel feels sorrow as she remembers Lulu's friendship. If Zariel is redeemed, Lulu once again serves as Zariel's friend and mount.

**Olanthius**. If the characters made an ally of Olanthius, the death knight kneels before Zariel. Seeing him fills Zariel with shame for leaving her loyal friend to a horrific fate. If Zariel is redeemed, she turns the death knight to dust, letting his soul rest at last.

If the Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check succeeds, continue with "Zariel's Redemption" below. If the check fails, proceed with "**area Zariel's Wrath**" instead.

#### Zariel's Redemption

If Zariel is convinced to accept the angelic spark, she grasps the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>. Read or paraphrase the following boxed text out loud when this happens:

> Zariel's trembling hand reaches toward the gleaming hilt of her sword. Her fingers brush against it, and she grimaces as radiant light sears her flesh. As her grip tightens, she gasps in pain, then speaks an oath through tears of confusion, sorrow, and dawning joy.
> 
> "I, Zariel, supplicate myself before the holy light of justice. If it should accept me, I vow to take up this blade once more in its service."
> 
> The archdevil's words hang in the air for a silent moment, and she glances upward in agonized uncertainty. Then Zariel is bathed in a brilliant wash of radiant light. Her fiery halo disappears, and feathers burst from her leathery wings. All of her diabolical features vanish as her angelic form is restored. At the sight of this blessed transformation, Lulu gasps in delight—and transforms into a celestial mammoth with golden fur, feathered wings, and gleaming tusks.

![undefined](adventure/BGDIA/102-zmysb-05-02.png)

All mortal creatures that witness Zariel's apotheosis are surrounded by twinkling wisps of the same light that transformed her, and are infused with a <wc-fetch type="reward">blessing of health</wc-fetch> (see "Other Rewards" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Returned to her full celestial glory, Zariel takes on the task of saving the besieged city of Elturel. If Zariel must travel some distance to reach Elturel, make sure the characters have the ability to keep up with the angel, or have her bring them along by magical means.

Zariel first soars above Elturel to within reach of the corrupted Companion. She closes her eyes, raises her sword above her head, takes a deep, centering breath, and brings the blade down. The Companion then explodes in a flash of light and sound, as described in "**area Shattering the Companion**" later in this chapter.

With the destruction of the Companion, the people of Elturel are freed from infernal bondage. The planetar imprisoned within the Companion raises the city out of the Nine Hells and returns it to Faerûn (see "**area The Planetar's Power**"). Zariel accompanies the city until she is satisfied that Elturel is safe.

The characters can return to the Material Plane with Elturel if they so choose, or they might wish to stick around Avernus to see who rises to become its new ruler (see "**area Ruling Avernus**").

If the characters return with Elturel to the Material Plane, read or paraphrase the following:

> The Chionthar River shines like a golden road stretching from Elturel to Baldur's Gate, and to the sea beyond. The scent of morning dew cuts through the odor of smoke, brimstone, and rot that clings to Elturel's stones.
> 
> Slowly, the people of the city make their way out from their hiding places to stand in the light of the mortal world once more. All eyes focus on Zariel where she stands, sword in hand. The planetar that raised Elturel out of Avernus kneels before her. Lulu nudges Zariel, then gestures toward you with her trunk. Zariel strides toward you, bowing her head in solemn gratitude. "This dark chapter has at last come to an end, and it is a brighter end than I ever dared to hope for. Thank you. Your selflessness will live on in my memory forever."
> 
> "And in mine!" Lulu says, beaming.
> 
> Zariel's tone turns more somber as she says, "You have made an enemy of Asmodeus this day. We have that in common now. I wish you strength and good fortune—and if ever you have need of my power, hold this feather aloft and invoke my name. I shall come to your aid."

Zariel pulls a single golden feather from one of her wings and hands it to the character closest to her. A creature that holds this feather can cast <wc-fetch type="spell">planar ally</wc-fetch> as an action, calling Zariel and Lulu only, after which the feather dissolves into a ray of sunlight. If the two are called to aid the characters, they do so for up to 1 hour, with no payment asked for in return.

> With her gift given, Zariel inclines her head, unfurls her wings, and soars into the sky. Lulu turns to wrap you all up in a massive hug with her trunk. When she lets you go, she smiles warmly and says, "We'll see each other again. Someday."
> 
> The golden mammoth then flaps her wings and soars into the sky. You watch her silhouette dwindle until it is swallowed by sunlight.

Characters who return with Elturel can find plenty to do in the city, aiding survivors and helping restore order in the aftermath of so much death and destruction. In addition to the leadership and magic the characters can lend to the people of Elturel, the planetar once bound within the Companion remains in the city for as long as it is needed, using its ability to raise the dead to restore as many of those lost to the destruction as it can.

In the longer term, the characters might also have loose ends in Baldur's Gate to take care of, especially if any villains in chapter 1 were left alive to continue their dark plots.

Even if the tale of the two cities has been successfully completed to the characters' satisfaction, the events of the adventure continue to play out in Baldur's Gate and Elturel after the fact. In particular, if Grand Duke Ravengard survives and returns with Elturel, the survivors of the city will be greatly in his debt. Ravengard's efforts to defend the city should dramatically change the political landscape of Baldur's Gate and Elturel, ushering in an era of detente, if not full friendship and alliance, between the two cities.

### Zariel's Wrath

If the characters fail to redeem Zariel and don't make a deal with her (see "**area Making a Deal with Zariel**"), she attacks. Her first goal is to destroy the adventurers who dared insult her, after which she means to erase from existence all those whom she once loved.

At this grim juncture, the characters' only hope is to defeat Zariel or to bend the knee in fealty. Killing Zariel frees the citizens of Elturel from infernal bondage. The characters might choose this endgame intentionally, or they could be forced to fight Zariel if they fail to redeem her.

Defeating Zariel is easier said than done. At her full power, the archdevil is more than a match for most mortals. Adventurers who hope to lay her low must scheme like a devil. Forging an alliance with a powerful, supernatural being such as Bel, Gargauth, Tiamat, or one of the demon lords besieging Avernus could grant the characters the power necessary to cast down Zariel.

#### Baphomet, Kostchtchie, or Yeenoghu

Baphomet and Yeenoghu are fighting to claim Avernus for themselves, and Kostchtchie (assuming the characters released him in **area chapter 3**) wants his hammer back. None of them can be trusted. Demon lords are savagery incarnate, and they take orders from no one.

The extent to which Baphomet, Kostchtchie, and Yeenoghu are present in Avernus makes it easy for characters to commune with any of these demon lords using <wc-fetch type="spell">contact other plane</wc-fetch> spells or similar magic.

#### Bel

Bel rankles at Zariel's rulership of the layer of the Nine Hells that was once his, but he won't challenge her directly as long as he thinks Asmodeus supports Zariel.

Bel's aim is to let the characters try to redeem Zariel by helping them retrieve her sword. Bel knows Zariel's redemption is a long shot, which is why he also gives characters a means to unlock the Companion. Freeing the planetar trapped within the Companion denies Zariel her latest prize—the city of Elturel—and makes her look inept, which is the best Bel can hope for.

#### Gargauth

The pit fiend} Gargauth would like nothing more than to be released from its prison and replace Zariel as Lord of Avernus. If the characters possess the <wc-fetch type="item">Shield of the Hidden Lord</wc-fetch>, they can free Gargauth as described in the item's description (see Appendix C).

If released, Gargauth thanks the characters through tears of mirth. The pit fiend's first act is to produce a contract out of thin air, claiming that it will aid the characters in their quest to destroy Zariel if they sign it. The contract is full of convoluted text, and is summarized in its final clause: "I, the undersigned, agree to form a compact with Gargauth, joining with it to destroy the archdevil Zariel. While bound by this compact, no intentional harm shall befall either party by the other party's hand, without voiding this agreement."

Gargauth takes joy in subverting ill-worded contracts and betraying those bound by them. Notably, the contract presented lasts only until Zariel is destroyed, after which point Gargauth intends to tear the adventurers limb from limb. Clever adventurers can subvert the pit fiend's betrayal by ensuring Zariel's capture, banishment, or some other nonlethal defeat.

In that event, though, Gargauth has left itself an easy out. The only consequence for harming an ally under the terms of the contract is the contract's immediate negation—leaving Gargauth free to do whatever it sees fit. The pit fiend hopes that it can sneak this ruse through unchallenged, and argues fiercely if the characters spot this tricky phrase and demand its removal from the contract.

#### Tiamat

The queen of evil dragons is mighty and aloof, and she rarely acts unless her triumph is assured. Challenging an archdevil directly is risky, and Tiamat stands to lose a great deal if Zariel prevails. Fortunately, Tiamat has a champion she can send in her stead: Arkhan the Cruel.

The adventurers can't communicate with Tiamat directly, but they can approach Arkhan at his tower (see "**area Arkhan's Tower**"). Arkhan is preoccupied with trying to find a way to free Tiamat from the Nine Hells while also staving off the physical deterioration caused by the <wc-fetch type="item">Hand of Vecna</wc-fetch>. He won't entertain thoughts of vanquishing Zariel unless there's something in it for him and his dark queen.

![White Abishai](adventure/BGDIA/103-83py4-05-03.png)

While the head of Zariel would be a grand trophy, a trophy isn't enough to sway Arkhan. The characters must convince him that he can rule Avernus in Zariel's stead, with Tiamat by his side and armies of abishai and infernal dragons at his back. After contemplating this notion, Arkhan raises the <wc-fetch type="item">Hand of Vecna</wc-fetch> and boasts, "With this hand, I shall tear Zariel's head from her shoulders and rule Avernus with my queen at my side."

Arkhan declares that he will muster an army and depose Zariel in ten days. Exactly ten days later, two hundred white abishai fly from Arkhan's tower toward Zariel's current location, with Arkhan leading the charge on the back of Asojano the chimera, and Torogar Steelfist by his side, carried on the back of Chango the manticore. Arkhan's army is bolstered by five chromatic dragons—one adult dragon of each color—sent by Tiamat to help ensure victory. If they so choose, the characters can join Arkhan. The abishai and the dragons engage Zariel's legions while Arkhan, Torogar, and the characters challenge the archdevil herself. This battle can play out as part of the "**area Endgame in Elturel**" section described at the end of this chapter.

### Serving Zariel

The characters might decide after meeting Zariel that they wish to serve her, joining her army and smiting demons in the Blood War. They also might wind up serving her if they fail to redeem her and wish to live.

#### Souls are Forfeit

Characters who choose to serve Zariel must sign a contract (see appendix A) forfeiting their souls to the archdevil. She then returns such characters to the Material Plane to do her bidding. Zariel has numerous schemes spinning at any given time, but the adventurers are particularly well suited to preparing Baldur's Gate to meet the same fate as Elturel. As a sign of favor, she bestows a charm upon each character (see "**area Archdevil Charms**").

Characters who die in Zariel's service are reborn as Lemure from the River Styx. They lose all memories of their previous lives, and their alignment changes to lawful evil. If a character pleased Zariel with their loyalty in life, she might allow them to keep their memories as she promotes them to an NPC devil of your determination.

#### Zariel's Sword is Destroyed

With no one to sway Zariel from her path to absolute damnation, Zariel demands that the characters give her the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch> if they possess it. After she claims the sword, Zariel holds it aloft and shatters it (see "**area Relinquishing the Sword**").

#### Lulu Falls

For Zariel to fall beyond redemption is the worst outcome for Lulu. This unimaginable tragedy shatters the hollyphant's mind, leaving Lulu insane. Roll or choose the specific effects of her madness from the long-term madness in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, but this madness can be overcome only by a <wc-fetch type="spell">greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.

### Ruling Avernus

If Zariel is redeemed or killed, the first layer of the Nine Hells falls into chaos. You can decide which of the many powerful figures in Avernus make a play to replace Zariel, but any new ruler immediately faces enemies on all sides. The invading armies of Baphomet and Yeenoghu are wreaking havoc and threatening to tear Avernus apart. Moreover, dozens of ambitious greater devils will gleefully try to supplant their new and untested ruler.

Ruling a layer of the Nine Hells as a mortal is effectively impossible. None of the devils of Avernus will knowingly serve anyone but a superior devil. However, Asmodeus admires ambition. The Lord of the Nine Hells might see a brash and powerful mortal as a worthy replacement for Zariel, offering to transform the character into an NPC archdevil that can rule Avernus. Alternatively, the characters might attempt to claim Avernus on their own terms.

Idealistic characters seeking to destroy the Nine Hells from the inside out might see this power vacuum as an opportunity to strike a mortal blow to Asmodeus's reign. This might be the only time in cosmic history that such a blindly idealistic cause could succeed. But even if the party can wrest Avernus from Asmodeus's control, this ultimately serves to unite the remaining archdevils, aligning them toward the common goal of reclaiming Avernus—which works to Asmodeus's advantage.

## Will Elturel Be Saved?

Unless the characters intervene, Elturel is inevitably dragged into the River Styx. The memories of its inhabitants will be wiped clean, and their souls will be made into devils—fodder for the front lines of the Blood War.

The characters have several ways to save the city at its most desperate hour (see "**area Endgame in Elturel**"). To save Elturel without redeeming Zariel, the chains binding the city to the infernal iron posts sinking into Avernus must be severed, and the city must be returned to the Material Plane.

> ### Forging the Blade of Avernus
> 
> At some point after the destruction of the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>, Zariel gives her servants (including the characters if they have taken on that role) the task of forging a new blade for her. This endeavor comes with the following objectives:
> 
> 
> 
> - If Bel is still in Zariel's service, she calls on him to forge the blade. Otherwise, her servants must scour the cosmos for a worthy weaponsmith, such as an efreeti from the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire.
> 
> - Zariel needs at least ten pounds of metal or material to make the blade of the sword. Adamantine would do, or a talon from Tiamat.
> 
> - To grant the blade its power, the freshly forged weapon must be quenched in the blood of a celestial, a demon lord, and an archdevil. Zariel can supply her own blood, but her servants must collect the other two sacrifices.
> 
> Zariel names this new artifact the <wc-fetch type="item">Blade of Avernus</wc-fetch>.

### Breaking the Chains

Eight chains of infernal iron anchor Elturel to its binding posts, and each of those chains must be broken to free the city. If all the chains are broken, Elturel remains floating above Avernus and is no longer drawn toward the River Styx. However, the characters must still find a way to return the city to the Material Plane.

Each chain link is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and is formed of a welded loop of infernal iron that is 5 feet thick. A chain link is a Huge object with AC 19, 250 hit points, a damage threshold of 30, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. See chapter 2 for information on moving along the chains and climbing the infernal iron posts they connect to.

#### Ire of Tiamat

Tiamat's divine power is mighty enough to break the chains that bind Elturel. Arkhan the Cruel is willing to commune with his goddess to this end, but only if the characters offer him a suitably potent gift. In an inscrutable twist, Tiamat decides to aid the characters, and tells Arkhan as such. Read or paraphrase the following:

> A shroud of confusion passes over Arkhan's face, dissolving his bravado. He mutters to Tiamat under his breath, "Is that wise, my queen?" Then his eyes darken as his body hangs limp like a puppet cut from its strings. After a moment, Arkhan stands up straight, his eyes glowing with prismatic light. A hungry smile crosses his face, and five voices echo from his mouth, each resonating with the ire of an imprisoned goddess.
> 
> "I will aid you," Tiamat growls. "If your power is enough to threaten Zariel's ambitions, then I have nothing to fear. I can destroy the chains binding Elturel, but you must be present to bear witness to my majesty. Now go. I will know when you are there."

When the characters next set foot in Elturel, Tiamat bursts forth from her distant lair and blazes like a meteor across the sky of Avernus. Appearing above the city, she swoops down and focuses her breath weapons on one chain at a time, dealing 67 acid damage, 88 lightning damage, 72 cold damage, and 91 fire damage—more than enough to destroy the chain's links. Once all eight chains are destroyed, Tiamat roars in triumph and departs.

#### Jaws of Crokek'toeck

If the demon Crokek'toeck is freed from the scab encasing the Bleeding Citadel, it begins wandering Avernus and devouring all in its path. Though the demon consumes indiscriminately, it hungers most for divine blood. As such, the essence of a good-aligned god, the blood of a good celestial, or even the blood of a good paladin draws Crokek'toeck's attention from miles away. If the adventurers slather a chain link in blood from such a source, Crokek'toeck picks up the delicious scent and gallops across Avernus toward it.

The creature must bleed willingly upon a chain link. Either it or an ally can use an action to wound the creature for 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) piercing or slashing damage. This damage can't be negated or reduced, and the infernal energy within the chains causes the creature's hit point maximum to be reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until the creature finishes a long rest. Lulu is willing to make at least part of this sacrifice of blood if the characters ask her.

Crokek'toeck appears near Elturel within 1 hour of the first drop of blood being shed. All nearby devils immediately try to slay the demon, while nearby demons leap to its defense. As the two opposing forces clash, Crokek'toeck slips past the devils. The demon can gnaw through a bloodied chain link in 1 minute.

### Breaking the Contract

Voiding the infernal contract between Zariel and Thavius Kreeg causes the hellish chains binding Elturel to crumble to ash. This can be accomplished by either killing Zariel or by destroying the original contract. Zariel can use an action to summon the contract, which appears in her one hand. The contract is otherwise hidden in a secret place known only to her. Getting Zariel to call forth the contract takes guile, as the archdevil can't be <wc-fetch type="condition">charmed</wc-fetch>. Destroying the original copy of Thavius Kreeg's contract frees Elturel while leaving Zariel's other contracts intact.

The original contract resembles the copy stored in Thavius's <wc-fetch type="item">infernal puzzle box</wc-fetch>: nine square plates of infernal iron linked together by short chains, each plate inseparable from the others and inscribed with the terms of the contract written in Infernal. Casting the contract into the River Styx or immersing it in molten magma of one of Avernus's active volcanoes destroys it instantly.

Destroying Zariel voids all the active contracts she has made with beings across the multiverse. This causes no small amount of cosmic chaos.

#### The Fate of Thavius Kreeg

If the characters killed Thavius Kreeg in Baldur's Gate, he crawled out of the River Styx as a lemure. In accordance with the terms of their contract, Zariel promoted him to an amnizu, then confined him in her fortress (see "**area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg**"). If Thavius dies in the Nine Hells as a devil, he is permanently dead—but this does not break the full terms of Zariel's contract. Even with the primary signatory dead, the people of Elturel remain bound to Zariel by the Creed Resolute.

##### Killing Thavius

Characters hoping for a climactic battle against a worthy adversary won't find one by fighting Thavius Kreeg. Despite the power he now possesses, the devil Thavius is a coward who would rather grovel than fight. Killing him marks a wretched end to a wretched life.

If the characters left Thavius alive in chapter 1, they must find a way back to the Material Plane to kill him. His location in Baldur's Gate (or the chance that he might have fled the city) is left to your determination, as is the process by which the characters can track down his devilish incarnation on Avernus after they return.

##### Mercy for the Fallen

If the characters threaten him, Thavius snivels and begs for his life. He also claims to know where the original contract that sealed Elturel's doom is hidden. This is a lie, the claim a desperate ploy to buy time and, hopefully, a chance to escape.

### The Ultimate Sacrifice

If the characters have no other options for dealing with Zariel, one or more of them might be willing to give up everything in order to save the innocent people of Elturel. When a good-aligned paladin or cleric of 10th level or higher performs such a selfless act, the power of that deed is eternally written upon their soul. To creatures that covet souls, this deed blazes like a bonfire in the darkness—and Zariel desires it. Such a character is likely destined to pass into the Upper Planes after death, and as such, they make a handsome prize for an archdevil to shape into a loyal servant of the Nine Hells.

If any of the characters fit that description, Zariel senses their power when the characters are in her presence. "Your soul shines bright," she says. "Brighter even than the beacon above Elturel. I would have it."

If the character willingly offers their soul in exchange for the souls of the people of Elturel, Zariel is taken aback by their selflessness. She furrows her brow and asks, "You would lay down your soul for these people? People whose cowardice and weakness have caused you nothing but grief?"

A character offering to sacrifice their soul can take advantage of this moment of uncertainty, making a Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check with advantage to sway Zariel from the path of evil. Resolve a successful check as noted in "**area Redeeming Zariel**" earlier in this chapter. Even if the check fails, though, Zariel accepts the offered soul in exchange for all the souls of Elturel. Unless you want to add additional challenges for the characters, the archdevil can free the city from its chains and return it to the Material Plane.

#### Relinquishing the Sword

If the characters try to bargain for Elturel's release without the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>, Zariel considers their offer and produces a contract stating that she will release the city in exchange for the sword, delivered without any complications or deceit. Lulu rankles at the idea of the characters forging any sort of pact with the archdevil, but holds out hope that Zariel can be redeemed if the sword is brought before her.

If the characters present the sword to Zariel and either fail to redeem her or choose not to try, read:

> Zariel grabs the sword by the blade and lets her fiendish blood cascade down its edge, snarling in pain. "With this final rite, I discharge my divine duty. Let my name be forever struck from the ledger of Mount Celestia." She tightens her grip, and the sword shatters. The angelic spark lodged within it dwindles, then dies.

Once destroyed, the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch> can't be restored, ending any hope of redemption for the archdevil.

![undefined](adventure/BGDIA/104-lempw-05-04.png)

### Making a Deal with Zariel

Characters out of other options might simply bow to Zariel's power. If the characters make a deal with Zariel to save Elturel, they must specify that the city is to be freed from its chains and returned to the Material Plane. Otherwise, Zariel will release the chains but leave Elturel in Avernus with no hope of salvation.

#### To Destroy a Demon Lord

Baphomet and Yeenoghu are both clear and present dangers to Avernus. Although Zariel would relish slaying either of them personally, she gladly draws up a contract agreeing to trade Elturel and the souls within the city for either demon lord's destruction. Delivering the glaive of Baphomet or the flail of Yeenoghu to her is sufficient to prove the characters' success.

If the characters agree to Zariel's terms, they learn that both demon lords have recently converged around Elturel. You can add either demon lord to the battle in "**area Endgame in Elturel**" later in this chapter. If the characters freed the demon lord Kostchtchie in **area chapter 3**, he can also make an appearance.

#### Shield of the Hidden Lord

If the characters still possess the <wc-fetch type="item">Shield of the Hidden Lord</wc-fetch>, Zariel blithely declares that she would consider trading Elturel for it. From within the shield, the pit fiend Gargauth begs and sobs and promises the world to the characters if they spare its life and find a way to restore the devil to its former glory. These are empty promises, though Gargauth's fear is real.

If the characters give her the shield, Zariel casts <wc-fetch type="spell">dispel evil and good</wc-fetch> on it. Her spell causes Gargauth to manifest as a miserable, malformed pit fiend at half its hit point maximum and with 4 levels of <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch>. She commands the characters to destroy the wretch. If they succeed, she casually dismisses them and ignores any attempt by the characters to hold her to promises made without a contract.

If the characters press Zariel for a formal agreement before giving her the shield, she presents a fair contract. However, she refuses to both free Elturel and return it to the Material Plane, promising only one or the other in exchange for the shield alone.

### Dealing with the Companion

The Companion that once warded Elturel against undead is powered by a planetar trapped inside it. Long thought of as Elturel's savior, the Companion was also its undoing, for it was the beacon that allowed the power of Avernus to drag the city into the Nine Hells.

The Companion is a nearly indestructible metal orb 50 feet in diameter. When it protected Elturel, it hung in the sky like a second sun and emitted sunlight so bright that the orb itself couldn't be seen. Now, lightning plays across the surface of the dull sphere, which is surrounded by a 400-foot-diameter, 10-foot-thick shell of impenetrable, magical darkness. A creature with <wc-fetch type="sense">darkvision</wc-fetch> can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If this darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 8th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

#### Unlocking the Companion

The Companion is sealed by nine locks evenly spaced around its equator. These locks can only be opened by inserting nine adamantine rods into them. The rods are hidden in Zariel's **area wrecked flying fortress**.

Inserting the nine adamantine rods into the nine locks of the Companion causes its upper hemisphere to open, freeing the planetar within.

#### Shattering the Companion

The <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch> has the power to shatter the Companion and dispel the darkness around it. Striking the orb with the sword causes the Companion to ring like a bell and then shatter, sounding out an angelic tone that can be heard with perfect clarity across the infinite breadth of Avernus. Unless the sword is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level, the unchecked power reverberates through the sword and shatters it.

Lulu knows that the sword possesses this power. However, she wants the characters to use the sword to redeem Zariel, not simply to save Elturel. As such, she conceals this fact unless it's clear that redeeming Zariel is an impossible task.

Alternatively, if the characters strike a bargain with a powerful entity such as Tiamat or a demon lord, that being can attack and shatter the Companion. For more information on allying with a supernatural power, see "**area Breaking the Chains**" earlier in this chapter.

#### The Planetar's Power

If the Companion is shattered or unlocked, the planetar inside it is released. The planetar's name is Nascius, and its power can help save Elturel, but only if the infernal chains that bind the city have been severed. If asked to save the city, the planetar takes a brief moment to recover its strength. It then swoops down below the fallen city, rises to set the earthmote on its broad shoulders, and raises Elturel out of Avernus and back to its rightful place in the Material Plane.

## Endgame in Elturel

The material presented earlier in this chapter describes some of the ways the characters might accomplish the goals of redeeming Zariel and saving Elturel. Within the range of available options, you are free to determine the conditions under which those goals are met.

This section describes an epic event that can serve as the adventure's climax: Elturel being pulled down into the River Styx while Zariel and her forces battle an army of demons beneath the city. A demon lord—either Baphomet or Yeenoghu—has launched an all-out attack on Elturel before it's dragged into the River Styx. This section includes encounters that you can run to challenge the characters as they maneuver to confront Zariel. These encounters are suitable for a party of four 13th-level characters. If the party is weaker or stronger, adjust the encounters accordingly.

### Event 1: River's Edge

Lulu guides the characters toward Zariel, finding her on the ground of Avernus beneath Elturel. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:

> Elturel hangs above you and the River Styx. The iron spikes that anchor the city have dragged it nearly to the river's banks. Within a few hours, Elturel will sink into the Styx.
> 
> Hordes of distant demons fly around the city like gnats, and a battle rages fiercely beneath it. Thousands of fiends clash in Elturel's shadow. And at their center stands a being wreathed in flame, striking down demons with tireless fury.
> 
> Lulu points at the figure with her trunk and whispers, "That's her. Zariel stands exactly where she always does—where the fighting is fiercest."

This encounter takes place on an open field bordered by the River Styx, with Zariel visible a mile away. Allow the characters a few moments to plan their next move. When they decide to act, two Horned Devil break toward them after a fleeing glabrezu, which is cut down and dissolves to ichor that flows into the Styx. The devils attack at range with Hurl Flame attacks. Each devil has 125 hit points remaining and fights to the death.

Between this event and the next, the characters might delve deeper into the melee, or could make their way up to Elturel by flying or climbing.

### Event 2: Field of Flames

The front of Zariel's army has crashed into the flank of the demonic horde, whether on the streets of Elturel or on the battlefield below. Taking on both armies headfirst is impossible, but savvy characters might be able to use the battlefield's geography to avoid combat.

The characters must make three group Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Stealth</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch>) checks to navigate the battlefield, with each round of checks increasing in difficulty—DC 15, DC 17, and DC 19. Every time the group fails a check, each character must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) poison damage plus 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) fire damage from the noxious gas and flames roiling across the battlefield.

After making these ability checks, the characters stumble into a battle between six Hezrou and Lucille, the pit fiend general they spotted as they were leaving Elturel at the end of **area chapter 2**:

> A pit fiend wearing an eyeless helm clutches an infernal battle standard in one clawed hand while swinging a huge flaming mace in the other. The pit fiend is beset on all sides by six hulking, froglike demons that croak vile epithets as they tear the pit fiend's flesh with their claws.

Two Hezrou break off from this melee to attack the characters. The other fiends continue fighting Lucille.

By the time the characters deal with the hezrous attacking them, Lucille has destroyed the remaining hezrous or sent them scrambling away in search of easier prey. Lucille turns toward the characters, gives them a curt nod, and takes to the air. Characters can attack the pit fiend, which has 175 hit points remaining. If they let it go, the pit fiend returns the favor by using its <wc-fetch type="item">helm of devil command</wc-fetch> to issue orders to its troops that the characters are not to be harmed. As the characters make their way toward Zariel, demons that might otherwise cross their path are intercepted by devils, creating an avenue of safe passage for the characters.

##### Treasure

Lucille's <wc-fetch type="item">helm of devil command</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type="item">battle standard of infernal power</wc-fetch> are described in appendix C.

### Event 3: Showdown with Zariel

At some point, the characters get close to Archduke Zariel of Avernus. When they do, Zariel is locked in combat with a hyena-faced balor—one of Yeenoghu's demons. A 100-foot-diameter circle has formed around Zariel and the balor, as other devils and demons stay clear of the destruction the two unleash. Unless the characters draw attention to themselves, the fiends pay them no mind.

If you don't want to roll dice to determine the outcome of this battle, Zariel reduces the balor to 0 hit points after 4 rounds of combat, causing it to explode in a great fireball. When the battle is over, Zariel has 450 hit points remaining and takes a round to collect herself as the eye of the storm that surrounded her dissolves once more into chaos.

If the characters released Kostchtchie from his prison in **area chapter 3** but lost track of him, the demon lord wades into battle and tries to get close enough to Zariel to wrest <wc-fetch type="item">Matalotok</wc-fetch>, his hammer, from her clutches. Devils loyal to Zariel confound Kostchtchie at every turn, denying him his prize, and Zariel herself refuses to engage him. Still, the characters can count on Kostchtchie to create a distraction big enough to draw attention away from their activities, whatever those might be.

It is hard for insignificant mortals to gain the archdevil's attention, but if they anger Zariel, aid her in combat, or display Lulu or the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>, she stops what she's doing and gives the characters a chance to speak to her—or to challenge her.

If the characters attempt to break the infernal chains binding Elturel to the posts that are slowly sinking into Avernus (see "**area Breaking the Chains**"), Zariel takes notice when the first chain is sundered or the planetar is released from the Companion. If the characters are making use of a demon to break the chains, Zariel attacks it and defeats it after <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> rounds if the characters don't come to the demon's aid. If Tiamat is the one destroying the chains, Zariel attacks the characters in the hopes that Tiamat will cease her attack once her accomplices are slain.

If Zariel is reduced to 100 hit points or fewer, she withdraws to the edge of the battle, taking refuge in her flying fortress if it's nearby and hasn't been destroyed (see "**area Zariel's Flying Fortress**").
