The characters should be 11th level by the time they discover the location of the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>. The weapon awaits them in a cathedral formed out of positive energy. Avernus abhors the structure and has surrounded it in a bloody scab, earning it the name the Bleeding Citadel. This scab has also engulfed a demon named Crokek'toeck that was sent by the demon lord Yeenoghu to devour the blade. The holy power of the citadel resists the scab's attempts to fully engulf it and make it one with Avernus, leaving the top of the citadel visible. The characters get directions to this location from Bel or Olanthius in chapter 3.

Yeenoghu's demons carve tunnels through the scab as they search for a way to free Crokek'toeck and break into the Bleeding Citadel, which is otherwise impenetrable. A nalfeshnee named Trantolox oversees this force.

## Approaching the Citadel

As the characters approach the Bleeding Citadel, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> A great, disgusting scab the size of a large hill rises up from a stinking swamp of blood. The domed top of an alabaster temple pokes through the scab. Many black iron chains of Avernus converge on the building, attaching within the grotesque mound.

![Diagram 4.1: Chapter 4 Flowchart](adventure/BGDIA/092-nerf8-flowchart-4-1.png)

The exposed portions of the Bleeding Citadel are impenetrable and indestructible. If Lulu is with the characters, she shares her fear that the scab will eventually cover the entire structure, whereupon the citadel will be absorbed into the Nine Hells and the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch> lost forever. She also tells the characters that the only entrance to the citadel is covered by the lower portion of the scab.

Yeenoghu's demons have dug tunnels and chambers throughout the scab. Unless otherwise noted, Yeenoghu's forces attack characters they notice and fight until destroyed.

## The Scab

The scab is 300 feet high. The lower 100 feet of the scab is hard as rock, and each 5-foot cube of hard scab has AC 17, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The upper 200 feet is newer, softer growth covered in weeping wounds. This part of the scab has a spongy consistency and is much easier to destroy. A 5-foot cube of soft scab has AC 9, 10 hit points, and immunity to psychic damage. Damage to the soft scab causes reeking blood to flow from the wound.

### Entering the Scab

The most obvious way to enter the Scab is through a hole near the top of the Scab (**area area S1**). Climbing a chain or the outer surface of the scab to reach this hole requires a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

Once inside the Scab, Lulu can sense the distance and direction of the Bleeding Citadel's entrance (**area area S14**), and guide the characters toward it.

### Interior Features

Map 4.1 shows a cross-section of the scab interior, the features of which are as follows:

**Darkness**. The scab contains no light sources unless the text states otherwise. The demons infesting the scab rely on <wc-fetch type="sense">darkvision</wc-fetch> to see.

**Interior Surfaces**. All tunnels and chambers were dug out by demons using their claws or, in some cases, their teeth.

**Pools of Blood**. Pools of blood fill the areas shown on map 4.1. The pools are difficult terrain. Any humanoid that enters or starts its turn in a pool must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains the flaw, "I am cruel and uncaring toward others," for the next 8 hours. This flaw overrides any conflicting personality trait. A <wc-fetch type="spell">dispel evil and good</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic removes the flaw.

**Tunnel Dimensions**. Unless noted otherwise, tunnels are 10 feet wide. At various points, the ceilings are so low that Medium characters must crawl to pass underneath them.

### Scab Locations

The following encounters are keyed to map 4.1. Because the scab wraps around the Bleeding Citadel, a creature can move off the left-hand side of the map onto the right-hand side of the map, or vice versa.

#### S1. Oozing Entrance

This entrance to the scab is a tube-shaped tunnel with a 20-foot radius. As the characters approach the entrance, read the following boxed text to the players:

> A circular gaping wound near the top of the scab forms a tunnel that descends into darkness.

The tunnel tapers as it descends toward area S2.

#### S2. Angelic Window

Demons digging in this tunnel exposed a 20-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide window:

> The scab on one side of this narrow passage is stripped away, partially revealing one of the citadel's stained glass windows. The opaque blue and yellow panes depict the contemplative face of a beautiful angel.

A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that the window radiates an aura of abjuration magic. The window is unbreakable, and no one can enter the citadel from here. Any creature of good alignment that touches the window gains 20 temporary hit points. A creature affected by the window's magic cannot be affected by the window again for 24 hours.

#### S3. Drowned Hag

When the characters enter this 30-foot-wide chamber, read the following boxed text to the players:

> A pool of blood fills the center of this chamber. Five goat-headed demons reeking of rot crouch along the edges of the pool, staring at a corpse floating in it.

Five Bulezau drowned a night hag in the pool. The hag, Yiggleblight, was working with Trantolox to find Crokek'toeck until the nalfeshnee suspected the hag was secretly plotting against it. Trantolox ordered the bulezaus to kill the hag. They plan to eat her once the corpse bloats, but the characters make excellent appetizers.

##### Treasure

If the characters search the hag's tattered robes, they find a belt pouch containing a diamond worth 5,000 gp and small flask of water from the River Styx. The flask magically preserves the water (see "**area River Styx**" for effects).

#### S4. Bloody Downpour

When the characters enter this 40-foot-wide chamber, read the following boxed text to the players:

> Blood streams down from a gaping wound in the ceiling, filling a large pool that covers the floor of this chamber. A hunk of scab floats in the blood.

Three <wc-fetch type="condition">invisible</wc-fetch> Barlgura cling to the walls of this chamber, their claws digging into the soft walls. The demons wait for prey to enter the room before attacking. They hungrily pursue more elusive prey.

The barlguras tore the floating chunk of scab from the center of the ceiling, causing blood to pour out of the wound. A character who expends five uses of a <wc-fetch type="item">healer's kit</wc-fetch> and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Medicine</wc-fetch>) check bandages the wound effectively enough to stop the downpour. This process takes 5 minutes and exposes the character to the blood's effects (see "**area Interior Features**"). A <wc-fetch type="spell">cure wounds</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic cast on the wound closes it, stanching the blood flow.

#### S5. Food Fight

When the characters enter this 30-foot-wide chamber, read the following boxed text to the players:

> Two fiends resembling scaly, 9-foot-tall, bipedal toads stand waist-deep in a pool of blood, bellowing as they claw at each other. Floating near them is the half-eaten corpse of a bearded devil clutching a glaive. The pool is 20 feet wide and 40 feet long, with a horseshoe-shaped ledge around it.

Two hungry Hezrou fight over the devil's tasty corpse. Unless they notice the characters, the demons battle until one of them is killed. If the characters allow the fight to play out, one hezrou emerges victorious with 30 hit points remaining. Characters have advantage on Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Stealth</wc-fetch>) checks made to sneak past the hezrous while the demons fight each other.

##### Treasure

The half-eaten bearded devil clutches a <wc-fetch type="item">+1 glaive</wc-fetch>.

#### S6. Torture Chamber

When the characters enter this large, 30-foot-wide chamber, read the following boxed text to the players:

> Two iron chains attached to the ceiling end in hyena skulls that bite into the flesh of a screaming devil with sharp spines covering its thin, man-sized body. Jabbing the chained fiend with their long proboscises are three droning flies as big as horses.

The chained fiend is Alazub, a barbed devil with 25 hit points remaining. The giant flies are three Chasme. Characters who enter the chamber are susceptible to the chasmes' Drone trait. The chasmes cease their torture of Alazub to attack intruders.

Trantolox caught Alazub sneaking around the scab and wants to know if the devil knows anything about the citadel that could help the demons break into it. Unfortunately for the barbed devil, it knows nothing that the nalfeshnee would consider useful.

##### Chains

The two chains that bind Alazub hold the barbed devil 25 feet above the floor. Each chain has AC 19, 15 hit points, and immunity to cold, fire, poison, and psychic damage.

The hyena skull at the end of each chain grips Alazub by one arm, biting into the devil's flesh. A character can use an action to rip a skull from Alazub's flesh, but doing so deals 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) piercing damage to the devil. This damage is considered magical and therefore ignores Alazub's resistance to piercing damage. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Medicine</wc-fetch>) check removes the skull-tipped chain from the devil without harming it.

##### Roleplaying Alazub

Alazub came to the scab to spy on Trantolox's progress for Zariel. If Alazub is freed, a character who makes a successful Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Deception</wc-fetch>) check against Alazub's Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Insight</wc-fetch>) check can convince the devil that Zariel sent the characters to save it. If convinced that the characters are on its side, a character who makes a successful DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check convinces Alazub to share the following information:

- Demons under the command of a nalfeshnee named Trantolox have found the entrance to the Bleeding Citadel but can't break in (see **area area S14**).
- A shadow demon has found Yeenoghu's lost pet, the great demon Crokek'toeck, in the hard part of the scab. It leads the crew of demons that is digging out the enormous creature (see **area area S9**).

If the characters refuse to free Alazub, the barbed devil tries to make a deal. It can offer the information it knows or anything else within its power in exchange for freedom. If Lulu is with the characters, she urges the characters not to make any deals with the devil and grows despondent if her advice is ignored. Lulu refuses to do anything but the bare minimum to help the characters until her confidence in their good judgment is restored.

If the characters mention their interest in the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>, Alazub realizes they are Zariel's foes and makes reporting that information to Zariel a priority. After being freed and talking with the characters, the barbed devil leaves the scab.

#### S7. Trantolox's Larder

When the characters enter this 20-foot-wide cavern, read the following boxed text to the players:

> Hordes of hellish flies buzz around this dark chamber, which is strewn with mutilated devil corpses and gnawed bones. A hole in the floor reveals another dark cavern below this one.

Close examination of the mutilated corpses reveals that they include three bearded devils, two barbed devils, and a bone devil. All of the corpses are torn to pieces and, in some cases, partially eaten.

The first time a creature that isn't a fiend tries to cross this room, the flies gather into four hostile Swarm of Insects. Replace the swarms' climbing speed with a flying speed of 30 feet.

<wc-gallery>

![Map 4.1: Side View of the Scab](adventure/BGDIA/093-p7lnx-map-4-1.jpg)

![(Player Version)](adventure/BGDIA/094-q5hof-map-4-1-player.jpg)

</wc-gallery>

#### S8. Hag's Lair

The tunnel leading to this cave narrows to a height of 2 feet, requiring Medium characters to crawl through it. As the characters peer into this 20-foot-wide chamber, read the following boxed text to the players:

> The floor of this dark cyst is strewn with bones and dotted with weeping sores. Shallow niches gouged into the scabby walls hold an assortment of stoppered flasks, polished black orbs, humanoid skulls, and other curios.

Yiggleblight the night hag used this chamber as a lair until she was rudely disposed of (see **area area S3**).

##### Treasure

A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals six magic items in the niches, including a black sack made of stitched flesh, a lustrous black gem shaped like a human baby's fist, an <wc-fetch type="item">iron flask</wc-fetch> containing a berserk fiendish flesh golem that can't be controlled, and three <wc-fetch type="item">Soul Coin</wc-fetch>. The sack is Yiggleblight's _soul bag_, which is of no use to the characters. The black gem is the night hag's _heartstone_. (For more information on these two magic items, see the "Night Hag" entry in the Monster Manual.)

Yiggleblight also kept a collection of poisons in six small, stoppered tubes made from human finger bones. Each flask holds a single dose of a different kind of poison: <wc-fetch type="item">Burnt Othur Fumes</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">Carrion Crawler Mucus</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">Essence of Ether</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">Malice</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">Oil of Taggit</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="item">Torpor</wc-fetch> (see "Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for the effects of each). A character with a <wc-fetch type="item">poisoner's kit</wc-fetch> can use it to take tiny samples of each poison for analysis. After spending 1 minute analyzing a poison, the character can identify it and its effects with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Nature</wc-fetch>) check. The character's proficiency bonus applies to the check if the character is proficient with the poisoner's kit.

The only other valuable items are three 3-pound orbs of polished obsidian (100 gp each) that can be used as arcane focuses for spellcasting.

Other curios include an empty casket sized for a human infant, a copper cowbell, a rope noose, a nothic's shriveled claw on the end of a black cord, a soot-stained wooden coffer containing three teeth from a red dragon wyrmling, a dead tomato plant in a ceramic pot adorned with images of dancing cherubs, and nine gnoll skulls.

#### S9. Digging Demons

At this point, the scab transitions from being soft and spongy to hard as rock.

When the characters enter this 20-foot-wide chamber, read the following boxed text to the players:

> Ten small, snarling demons covered in matted gray fur claw and bite a hole into the hard, scabby floor. A demon made of shadow flies over the smaller fiends, screaming at them in Abyssal.

If Lulu is with the characters, she senses the presence of Crokek'toeck nearby (see area S10). She tells the characters about Yeenoghu's pet and speculates that the demons are trying to free Crokek'toeck.

Vatilan, a shadow demon, directs seven Dretch to dig their way toward area S10. The shadow demon found Crokek'toeck while scouting the scab using its Incorporeal Movement trait. If the characters attack, the shadow demon leaves the dretches behind as it passes through the nearest wall and heads to **area area S14** to warn Trantolox that intruders are near. Vatilan remains by the nalfeshnee's side until convinced that the intruders have been dealt with.

#### S10. Crokek'toeck's Prison

Yeenoghu's pet, Crokek'toeck, is tightly packed into this cavity, <wc-fetch type="condition">incapacitated</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type="condition">restrained</wc-fetch>. If at least 20 feet of the scabby walls that encase Crokek'toeck are destroyed, the monster is able to move its body again and breaks free of the scab.

If Crokek'toeck breaks out of the scab, it leaves a 30-foot-radius passage in its wake. The fiend is hungry and tries to consume any creature that crosses its path. It then leaves to find its master, Yeenoghu.

If Crokek'toeck is freed, Trantolox and the rest of the demons in **area area S14** investigate. The nalfeshnee attempts to control Crokek'toeck, but Yeenoghu's pet answers only to the Gnoll Lord. After Trantolox tries to control Crokek'toeck for 3 rounds, the nalfeshnee and the other demons retreat back to **area area S14**.

#### S11. Statue of Yeenoghu

When the characters enter this 40-foot-wide chamber, read the following boxed text to the players:

> A nine-foot-tall statue of a hulking biped with clawed hands and feet stands on the floor of this chamber. Three vulture-like demons and six gnolls cackle as they dance around the statue.

Three Vrock and six Gnoll dance around the statue, reveling in their evil madness. The vrocks are quick to use their spores, even if it means infecting their gnoll allies. The demons and gnolls fight to the death.

The statue is carved out of hardened scab. A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that it radiates an aura of evocation magic. Any demon or gnoll with at least 1 hit point remaining that starts its turn within 30 feet of the statue regains 10 hit points.

If Lulu is with the characters, she recognizes that the statue is a crude likeness of Yeenoghu and encourages the characters to destroy it.

The statue is a Large object with AC 17, 60 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the statue is destroyed, it explodes. Each creature within 30 feet of the exploding statue must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### S12. Trantolox's Chamber

When the characters enter this 30-foot-wide chamber, read the following boxed text to the players:

> A massive pile of bones and offal sits in the middle of this otherwise empty chamber.

Creatures who examine the bones and offal closely notice a stoppered bottle in the pile.

##### Treasure

The bottle is a <wc-fetch type="item">eversmoking bottle</wc-fetch>.

#### S13. Cackling Gnolls

Characters hear the cackling of gnolls as they enter this corridor. They can surprise the gnolls by dousing their lights and succeeding on a DC 10 group Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Stealth</wc-fetch>) check.

Targ Nar, a gnoll fang of Yeenoghu with 100 hit points, is here with a gang of fifteen Gnoll. Targ Nar obeys Trantolox, who has ordered him to guard the corridor. To pass the time, the gnolls are tossing around the severed head of one of their fellow gnolls, whom Trantolox decapitated on a whim.

#### S14. Entrance to the Bleeding Citadel

When the characters arrive at this 40-foot-wide area, read the following boxed text to the players:

> Brass double doors stand exposed in the wall of the scab. A relief image on the doors depicts a blindfolded angel wielding a sword, and carved into the door frame are beautiful, gold-inlaid runes. Three goat-headed demons with barbed tails throw themselves against the door as a corpulent, ape-like fiend with tusks and tiny wings kicks at them, roaring commands in Abyssal.

Trantolox, a nalfeshnee, is commanding three Bulezau to force open the double door that leads into the Bleeding Citadel. The nalfeshnee is desperate to get inside to claim the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch> for Yeenoghu. Despite the bulezaus' best efforts, the doors refuse to budge (see "Doors" below).

The nalfeshnee doesn't attack the characters right away if it thinks it can trick them into opening the doors for it. The nalfeshnee suggests an alliance and an "equal split" of whatever treasure is hidden inside the citadel. If Lulu is with the characters, she strongly advises them not to trust the demon. Trantolox has no intention of honoring the deal and claims to know nothing about the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>. In battle, the nalfeshnee fights until reduced to 60 hit points, then tries to flee the scab and report back to Yeenoghu. The insane bulezaus fight to the death.

##### Doors

The doors, like the citadel itself, are indestructible. The runes around them say, in Celestial: "Against evil, we stand united. Only the pure of heart can part these holy gates."

A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the double door, which can be opened only by a creature of good alignment while Lulu is within 60 feet of the door. Lulu herself can open the doors, if need be. If Lulu is alive but not present when the characters try to enter the citadel, the doors remain locked. The characters receive a telepathic message from an unfamiliar female voice, saying, "Bring Lulu here, and I'll let you inside." Only when the characters return with Lulu can the doors be opened. If Lulu died earlier in the adventure, she's waiting for them inside the citadel, just beyond the doors.

When the doors open, a bright white light pours out, filling area S14. Any fiend or undead that enters or starts its turn in the light must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (<wc-roll>8d10</wc-roll>) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fiends and undead can't pass through the doorway of the citadel even while the doors are open.

##### Character Advancement

Allow players to advance their characters from 11th to 12th level before they enter the Bleeding Citadel.

![undefined](adventure/BGDIA/095-zfnvo-04-02.png)

## Entering the Citadel

The characters should be 12th level by the time they enter the Bleeding Citadel. The citadel has one purpose: to keep the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch> out of evil hands.

Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players when the characters enter the Bleeding Citadel:

> A bright white light burns away the blood and grit staining your clothes. Restorative energy brings life to numb muscles as the glow softens to reveal the interior of a sun-kissed cathedral. How light passes through the scab and into the stained glass windows is a mystery only magic can answer.
> 
> Pillars line a path from the door to a raised dais carved with Celestial runes. Embedded in a stone atop the dais is a glowing longsword.

If Lulu died earlier in the adventure, add the following:

> Fluttering just inside the doorway is a golden hollyphant that greets you with a pleasing trumpet sound.

Lulu has all her hit points if she's restored to life by the citadel's magic. However, she has no memories between the time the characters last saw her and now.

The holy power of the citadel restores the characters, and they gain the benefits of a long rest. If a creature gained a flaw from a blood pool or similar effect, the flaw is removed. Casting <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> in the Bleeding Citadel reveals that the whole structure radiates auras of abjuration and evocation magic.

The interior of the citadel is one large alabaster chamber brightly lit by magically created sunlight shining through windows. The sword atop the dais is the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>). The carvings on the dais read, in Celestial, "The hero who becomes one with this blade exists no longer."

The characters can't claim the sword until they complete the Idyllglen memory (see "**area Idyllglen**" below).

### Yael's Ghost

If the characters move toward the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>, the ghost of Yael appears before them and pulls the characters into one of Lulu's forgotten memories to see if they are worthy of possessing the weapon. Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> The translucent image of a woman in her thirties wearing plate armor and bearing a thin scar on her cheek appears before you. As she points toward the hollyphant, Lulu's eyes turn pure white. A whisper fills your ears and says, "I remember!" A wave of radiant energy erupts from Lulu's body and in that blinding flash the ghostly warrior, the hollyphant, and the Bleeding Citadel disappear.
> 
> The solace of the cathedral is replaced by havoc, screams of panic, and acrid smoke. You stand at the edge of a small town of burning cottages, fields, and trees. A broken sign on the ground reveals the settlement's name: Idyllglen. Shrieking townsfolk run from cackling, snarling demons and gnolls.

The characters are transported into Lulu's memory of Idyllglen near the west edge of Idyll Road (**area area I1** on map 4.2).

## Idyllglen

Yael pulls the characters into Lulu's memory of Zariel's final battle against Yeenoghu in Faerûn. The characters experience a series of events in Idyllglen before returning to the Bleeding Citadel, where they can finally claim the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>. While the characters are in Idyllglen, Lulu is not with them, though she does make an appearance as a winged mammoth in "**area Event 7. Zariel's Arrival**".

### Idyllglen History

Any character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">History</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Religion</wc-fetch>) check recalls the following information about Idyllglen:

- Ages ago, Idyllglen was threatened by gnoll tribes. As the gnolls raided the town, Solndor Brightstar, a cleric of Lathander, led the people in prayer to his god for aid. Lathander was moved by the people's bravery and sent the angel Zariel to defeat the gnolls. After driving off the gnolls, the people erected a statue of Zariel to honor her.
- Generations later, the gnolls returned to Idyllglen, this time with demons in their ranks and Yeenoghu himself leading the war band. Zariel and the Hellriders came to the Idyllglen's aid, but not before the town was mostly destroyed.

### Idyllglen Features

The town of Idyllglen has the following general features.

#### Borders

The characters are confined to the part of Idyllglen shown on map 4.2. Beyond the edges of the map, everything is engulfed in a smoky haze. Characters who fly or levitate to an altitude of 120 feet or higher find themselves engulfed in a similar smoky haze.

A creature that enters or starts its turn in the haze must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Burning Buildings

The unlabeled buildings on map 4.2 are homes and businesses that the gnolls have set ablaze. The buildings' supplies were taken by fleeing townsfolk or ransacked by Yeenoghu's horde. Each building is one or two stories tall (DM's choice) and 10 feet high per story. The interior rooms of the buildings have 9-foot-high ceilings with 8-foot-high doorways connecting them. A character can climb the walls of a building without equipment by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

A creature that starts its turn in or on a burning building must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Burning Trees

Each tree depicted on map 4.2 is <wc-roll>1d6 + 10</wc-roll> feet tall and on fire. No ability check is required to climb a tree. However, a creature that starts its turn in a burning tree must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Townsfolk

Like Idyllglen itself, the townsfolk are figments created from Lulu's memory. Most residents of Idyllglen flee for their lives or hide in terror. If the characters try to get information out of these townsfolk, the most anyone can offer are a few quick words about demons and gnolls coming out of nowhere to ransack the town.

The characters have opportunities to save Idyllglen's people from Yeenoghu's hordes and other dangers. Townsfolk saved from certain death give a quick show of gratitude before running toward the hazy borders of Lulu's memory and disappearing.

#### Character Death

The Idyllglen memory is as real to the characters as any location, and they can die here.

### Idyllglen Locations

<wc-gallery>

![Map 4.2: Idyllglen](adventure/BGDIA/096-dj9yv-map-4-2.jpg)

![(Player Version)](adventure/BGDIA/097-ijryu-map-4-2-player.jpg)

</wc-gallery>

The following locations are keyed to map 4.2.

#### I1. Idyll Road

Idyll Road is the only paved street in Idyllglen. It leads from the west edge of the town to the statue of Zariel (area I2). The street is strewn with broken carts, debris, and corpses.

#### I2. Statue of Zariel

This 30-foot-tall, white marble statue stands atop a 2-foot-high raised dais and depicts an armored, blindfolded angel in a calm, protective stance, with her sword drawn and wings unfurled. The dais is carved with the following words, in Common: "Zariel, guardian of Idyllglen. Offer prayers to Lathander, and his light will shield thee."

This statue of Zariel is a Gargantuan object with AC 17, 300 hit points, a damage threshold of 15, and immunity to poison, psychic, and radiant damage. A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that the statue radiates an aura of abjuration magic.

Any fiend that starts its turn within 15 feet of the statue causes it to flare with radiant energy. Each time the statue flares, every fiend within 30 feet of it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (<wc-roll>4d8</wc-roll>) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Any character who touches the statue and uses an action to offer a prayer to Lathander gains the benefit of a <wc-fetch type="spell">protection from evil and good</wc-fetch> spell for 1 hour. A character can gain this benefit only once while in the memory.

#### I3. Temple of Lathander

This two-story, white stone temple carved with images of the sun on its exterior walls is the largest building in the town. Iron shutters cover the building's windows, and its doors are made of oak. The temple's occupants and features are discussed more below.

**Occupants**. Jhessa Brightstar, a neutral good female human priest of Lathander, leads a congregation of fifty townsfolk (Commoner) in prayer on the first floor. If forced into combat, the commoners take the <wc-fetch type="action">Dodge</wc-fetch> action. The townsfolk are terrified of Yeenoghu's forces and grateful for any aid the characters provide.

**Illumination**. Torches burning in sconces brightly light the temple's interior.

**Barred Entrance**. An oak double door serves as the temple's entrance and is barred from the inside. A creature can use an action to try to force open the doors from the outside, doing so with a successful DC 22 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A character can also convince the congregation to open the doors by shouting through the doors and succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check.

**Shuttered Windows**. All windows are covered with locked iron shutters. The iron shutters are latched from the inside and have AC 19, 25 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A character with <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch> can try to unlock a window's shutters, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

##### Roleplaying Jhessa Brightstar

Jhessa is a pious priest of Lathander and a descendant of Solndor Brightstar (see "**area Idyllglen History**"). The soft-spoken woman in her forties leads her flock in a prayer to Lathander, begging the Morning Lord to send Zariel to protect the people of Idyllglen once more.

Jhessa is steadfast in her faith that Lathander hears the prayer and believes it's just a matter of time before Zariel appears. If she meets the characters, Jhessa uses her spells to heal and bolster them, hoping they can protect her congregation long enough for Zariel to arrive. If the forces of Yeenoghu enter the temple, Jhessa puts herself between any threat and the commoners within, giving her life if necessary.

### Idyllglen Events

The following events occur in sequence as soon as the characters arrive in Idyllglen.

#### Event 1. Characters' Arrival

When the characters arrive in Idyllglen (at **area area I1**), the following encounters occur simultaneously:

- Six Gnoll surround and attack the characters.
- Six Dretch on Idyll Road (**area area I1**) claw at an overturned cart covering Ella Deepwell, a neutral female human commoner.
- A giant hyena attacks a mastiff near the statue of Zariel (**area area I2**).
- A hezrou pounds on the door to the temple of Lathander (**area area I3**), trying to force its way inside.

Have the players roll initiative for their characters, then roll initiative for the gnolls, dretches, giant hyena, mastiff, and hezrou. All the gnolls act on the same initiative count, and all the dretches act together as well. Ella doesn't participate in the combat.

##### Gnolls

The gnolls fight to the death, cackling maniacally all the while.

##### Cart and Dretches

The cart is a Large object with AC 15, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A creature can use an action to attempt to lift the cart, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

If the dretches destroy the cart, they attack Ella Deepwell. If she dies, the dretches attack the characters.

If the characters attack the dretches, the dretches turn to fight them, ignoring the cart. Once the dretches are destroyed, Ella emerges from the cart, thanks the characters, and flees to safety.

##### Giant Hyena and Mastiff

If the characters don't intervene, the giant hyena turns its attention to the characters after killing the mastiff. If the characters attack the giant hyena, it ignores the mastiff and turns to face the bigger threat, fighting to the death.

The mastiff stays with the characters if they rescue it, using the <wc-fetch type="action">Help</wc-fetch> action to distract enemies in combat. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check can convince the mastiff to stay out of the fight and find shelter.

##### Hezrou

On its turn, the demon tries to force open the temple doors, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. If the hezrou forces open the doors to the temple, it begins attacking the people inside on its next turn. If the characters attack the hezrou or it kills all the creatures in the temple, it turns its attention toward the characters.

##### Next Event

When only one of the characters' enemies remains, proceed with event 2.

#### Event 2. Yeenoghu's Champion

This event overlaps with the end of the previous event. When it begins, read the following to the players:

> A chorus of screams rises up as people, sheep, and pigs scamper through the town, chased by a demon with the lower body of a great serpent and the upper body of a six-armed gnoll clutching a wicked sword in each of its clawed hands.

The terrified animals and townsfolk dart through Idyllglen, chased by Garoknul, a unique demon in the service of Yeenoghu. Use the marilith stat block to represent Garoknul. The fleeing beasts and townsfolk disappear when they reach the edge of the map. Garoknul stops its chase to battle the characters. If reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, Garoknul uses its next action to teleport away.

##### Next Event

When Garoknul leaves the area or dies, proceed with event 3.

#### Event 3. Madness Reigns

This event begins as the previous one ends. Read the following boxed text to the players:

> Five guards wielding spears advance from the north. Splattered head-to-toe with black ichor, they gaze at you with hungry eyes.

The five human Guard are named Caladra Telmaster, Esselyn Xharn, Jai Wen, Tal Hannefar, and Yaerklos Summerlast. Their armor is covered in the ichor of Yeenoghu's demons. The ichor has driven the guards mad, making them hunger for humanoid flesh. When they notice the characters, the guards attack.

If a character kills a guard, Lulu's mind attempts to punish the character. That character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> as Lulu's mind saps the character's energy.

A guard's madness can be cured with a <wc-fetch type="spell">dispel evil and good</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">greater restoration</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type="spell">remove curse</wc-fetch> spell. Guards who are cured of their madness thank the characters and explain that they were battling demons in the fields when they suddenly felt an overwhelming desire to consume humanoid flesh. These guards are eager to return to the battle in the fields, disappearing as they pass through the hazy border.

##### Next Event

After the characters deal with the guards, proceed with event 4.

#### Event 4. Unsettling Calm

This event begins with Yael telepathically contacting the characters:

> A woman's voice enters your mind. "Nice work. Take a break. You've got an hour before the really bad stuff happens."

The characters can spend the next hour interacting with Lulu's memory of Idyllglen. They can explore the town, extinguish fires, speak to Jhessa Brightstar in the temple of Lathander (**area area I3**), or take a short rest. During this time, the fields continue to burn, and the occasional scream is heard in the distance beyond the hazy border.

##### Next Event

As this event approaches its end, the characters hear cackling laughter far off in the distance. This laughter gets closer and louder, heralding the arrival of more of Yeenoghu's troops. Proceed with event 5.

#### Event 5. Renewed Assault

This event begins as the previous one ends. Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> Six demons appear on the western edge of Idyllglen—a hulking, ape-like brute and five small, doglike creatures with rubbery gray bodies and big ears. Cackles in the distance signal more enemies on the way.

A barlgura and five Dretch appear on the western edge of map 4.2. If these demons notice the characters, they attack. If they don't notice the characters, they attack the temple (**area area I3**), hoping to kill everyone within. At the start of the second round of combat, a gnoll pack lord and six Gnoll join the fray from the south. At the start of the third round of combat, a vrock swoops down from the sky to join the battle.

##### Next Event

When only three enemies remain or after six rounds of combat, whichever comes first, proceed with event 6.

#### Event 6. Yeenoghu

This event overlaps with the end of the previous one. Read the following boxed text to the players:

> A wild, hideous laugh pierces the air and cuts through the din of battle. A giant gnoll covered in matted, bloodstained fur and swinging a three-headed flail charges out of the haze from the west. Gore drips from his red maw, open in a violent laugh.

Yeenoghu attacks any creature not allied with him that he notices. If Yeenoghu doesn't notice any enemies, he attacks the statue of Zariel (**area area I2**) before moving on to the temple (**area area I3**).

##### Next Event

Event 7 begins after three rounds of combat with the demon lord or when Yeenoghu is reduced to 100 hit points or fewer.

#### Event 7. Zariel's Arrival

This event overlaps with the end of the previous one. Read the following boxed text to the players:

> The cackling demon lord shuts his maw and narrows his eyes, gazing up toward the sky as a beam of radiant light pierces the haze. A powerful angel streaks down from above, followed by a gold-furred mammoth with feathered wings. The angel slashes her sword across Yeenoghu's chest and utters a spell. A portal opens behind the demon lord as the mammoth rams its head into Yeenoghu. The demon lord is sent tumbling through the portal, which quickly closes behind him.

The angel is Zariel (use the solar stat block), and the winged mammoth is Lulu the hollyphant in shapechanged form. After ridding Idyllglen of Yeenoghu, Lulu and Zariel introduce themselves to the characters, healing them as best they can. While these introductions happen, the original Hellriders (Knight) appear on Warhorse and kill any remaining demons and gnolls. One of these Hellriders, a woman in her thirties with a fresh, deep cut on her cheek, thanks the characters and introduces herself as Yael. She gives a wink before lining up to join the rest of the battalion. The characters might also recognize Olanthius, Haruman, and other original Hellriders they have come across during their travels in Avernus.

Zariel can cast the <wc-fetch type="spell">resurrection</wc-fetch> spell up to three times. She uses this magic to resurrect as many dead characters as she can.

As Zariel prepares to lead her forces through the portal into Avernus, all other creatures except for her, Lulu, and the characters stop moving and responding as if frozen in time. Zariel turns to the characters and says, "Yeenoghu slaughtered those I swore to protect. I can stop him and others like him. I might have to give up all I stand for, but I could stem the tide of chaos and save many lives from the demonic terrors of the Abyss. Were you in my place, would you risk it all to save others?"

Zariel lets each character answer her question in turn. She thanks them for their responses, then utters a blessing to Lathander over the characters. Characters who answered that they would risk it all as Zariel did each gain a <wc-fetch type="reward">charm of vitality</wc-fetch>. Characters who answered that they would not risk it all to stop the demon lords each gain a <wc-fetch type="reward">charm of restoration</wc-fetch>. (See "Charms" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for the benefits of these supernatural gifts.) Characters who can't or won't answer the question receive nothing.

Once Zariel bestows her supernatural charms, Lulu's Idyllglen memory ends. A flash of light brings all the characters (including dead ones) back to the Bleeding Citadel so that one of them might finally claim the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>.

## Claiming the Sword

When the characters return to the Bleeding Citadel from Lulu's memory of Idyllglen, read the following boxed text to the players:

> You stand before the dais, atop which glows the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>. Also before you are Lulu and the ghostly warrior, Yael. The hollyphant is the first to speak. "I remember everything now. Idyllglen was the last straw. We followed Zariel to Avernus, but the evil there proved to be too much for us. Asmodeus appeared and promised Zariel infernal legions to end the Blood War, but she had to give the Lord of the Nine Hells her fealty. She accepted and became an archdevil, but not before Yael and I took her sword, hoping it could redeem Zariel someday. I gave up my magic and memories, and Yael gave her life to construct this place to protect the sword."
> 
> Yael's ghost says, "You have faced many trials to claim the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>. I'm sorry to say, you face one more. As the inscription on the dais says, 'The hero who becomes one with this blade exists no longer.' Which of you is brave enough to draw the blade and be gone forever?"

Any character who survived Lulu's memory of Idyllglen can pull the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch> from the dais. Characters who died in Idyllglen are not able to remove the sword from the stone.

Once the sword is removed from its stone, a character can attune to it immediately if the sword deems that character worthy, and attuning to the sword changes the character irrevocably (see the item's description in Appendix C). When a character attunes to the sword, the citadel and the scab around it explode outward in blinding rays of light. Creatures in the scab take 110 (<wc-roll>20d10</wc-roll>) radiant damage and are hurled 1,000 feet away from the sword. Any demons that survive the explosion limp off to lick their wounds. Creatures inside the Bleeding Citadel are unharmed by the explosion and find themselves suddenly under Avernus's red sky.

Once a character claims the <wc-fetch type="item">Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>, Yael's work is done. Her ghost bids the party good luck and fades away as her soul passes into the afterlife.

The destruction of the Bleeding Citadel restores all of Lulu's memories, which she can share with the characters. Lulu continues to travel with the characters and encourages them to use the sword to redeem Zariel.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be at least 13th level before heading into chapter 5 of the adventure.
