In episode 1 of the adventure, a case of mistaken identity gives the characters a rare opportunity to make a name for themselves in Acquisitions Incorporated. Their assigned task is to investigate a sinkhole fissure that opened up in Waterdeep after a small earthquake struck the city—the side effect of Caerhan Coalsmith's failed attempt to destroy the <wc-fetch type="item">Orrery of the Wanderer</wc-fetch>. If the characters can conclude the investigation successfully, Acquisitions Incorporated CEO Omin Dran presents them with a unique chance to rise within the ranks of the organization.

## A Disorienting Orientation

The adventure begins with the characters seeking franchise opportunities or internships at the Waterdeep offices of Acquisitions Incorporated. All the characters should know the popular tales of that well-known organization and might have ties to Acq Inc (especially characters with one of the backgrounds from chapter 3).

> Sure, I get it. Your first time meeting Omin Dran can be intimidating. But just remember, under all that armor is a merciless psychopath infused with the power of a god.
> 
> - Jim Darkmagic

For a nervously long length of time, the characters are kept waiting in a conference room at Head Office. Read or paraphrase the following to begin:

> Your inquiries into internships and franchise opportunities at Acquisitions Incorporated have gone even better than you'd hoped. Ridiculous rumors talk about how prospective interns of Acq Inc aren't always treated with respect, dignity, or care. Even more ridiculous tales of interns dying at an alarming rate are told throughout the city. Thankfully, you don't believe a word of any of that.
> 
> So far, everyone at Head Office has treated you with kindness, and even a bit of deference. You were shown into this elegant conference room, given fine food and drink, and asked to wait to speak with none other than Omin Dran—founder and CEO of this august organization.

If the characters already know each other, they were ushered into the conference room as a group. If they came to Head Office separately, they were each brought in alone and asked to wait with the others, and have a chance to introduce themselves before Omin appears.

> It isn't long before the door to the conference room opens, and an intense-looking half-elf in plate armor enters. He wears a holy symbol of Tymora, the goddess of fortune, around his neck. It's Omin Dran! With no introduction, the CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated speaks.
> 
> "Thank you for answering my call so quickly. When the earthquake struck the city two days ago, damage was limited, but a sinkhole opened up a fissure beneath an abandoned warehouse in Dock Ward. Two City Watch guards entered the fissure to investigate, but never came out. They're now feared dead, and the City Watch has asked me to take over the investigation. But my schedule is complicated at the moment, so I'm delegating that job to you. As an experienced adventuring group, I have no doubt that you can handle the task."
> 
> Before you have any chance to respond, Omin drops a hefty bag of coins onto the table. "The pay is 500 gold dragons for the group, with a 20 percent commission going to Acquisitions Incorporated as the broker. Go to the warehouse next to Jolly's Lamp Emporium down by the docks. Tell the City Watch guards stationed there that I sent you. Explore the fissure, learn the fate of the guards who went missing, and then come back to me with the signed City Watch papers confirming your completed work."
> 
> Then without another word, Omin Dran turns and leaves the room.

Through a crazy and never-to-be-explained misunderstanding, Omin believes that the characters are a group of experienced adventurers that he put out a call for just the day before. If the characters attempt to correct this misunderstanding, he ignores them. The CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated has important business to deal with, and can't be bothered with such trifles.

> When visiting Head Office, never approach Omin directly. Use the proper forms and filing procedures. After a brief four-month waiting time, you will be granted a very generous sixty-second meeting. It'll be the best minute of your life.
> 
> - Walnut Dankgrass

#### Jim Darkmagic Sets Things Straight

With absolutely no idea what they're meant to do or how they got into this position, the characters might try to seek out assistance before they leave Head Office. Or they might just wander around lost for a bit. Either way, Jim Darkmagic approaches the group with some words of... well, let's call it wisdom. When it's time for Jim to make his appearance, read or paraphrase the following:

> A puff of smoke erupts out of nowhere. As the haze disperses, a handsome figure steps forward. It's Jim Darkmagic of the New Hampshire Darkmagics! Except he's wearing a set of glasses that he apparently thinks is an effective disguise as he bows before you.
> 
> "I'm no one you know," he says. "But I couldn't help but notice that you seem a little flustered. I believe Omin just offered you work. And I also have a feeling you might not be the adventurers he thinks you are."
> 
> Jim looks around to make sure no one else is listening in, then leans forward to deliver a conspiratorial whisper. "You want my advice? Do the job. If you can pull it off, Omin will be so impressed that you'll have a leg up on everybody else trying to gain footing with the company. You've heard the phrase "opportunity knocks?" Well, opportunity is heading right at your door with a battering ram. Stand in that doorway, friends. Let opportunity smash its way in."

![JIM DARKMAGIC](adventure/OoW/041-04-03.png)

Jim's reasons for interceding with the characters are left to your determination. He might have intercepted the experienced adventurers Omin called for, then sent them off on a secret personal mission on his own behalf. Or he might have accidentally set them on fire when they arrived at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office. Whatever the case, he needs the players' group to attempt Omin's mission, and he's keen to get them on their way.

If the characters have any questions about the assignment, Jim can be the vessel through which you answer. Those who appear enthusiastic, appreciative, and deferential to Jim might even be gifted a <wc-fetch type="item">spell scroll</wc-fetch> of <wc-fetch type="spell">Jim's magic missile</wc-fetch>. However, before an arcane caster can use the <wc-fetch type="item">spell scroll</wc-fetch> or copy it into a spellbook, they need to understand the new royalty component for spells. See "New Spells" in chapter 3 for more information.

If the characters attempt to sort the case of mistaken identity out, Jim tells them Omin is unavailable, and concedes that they don't have to take the job. He points out that the characters are welcome to leave Acq Inc and never come back. But Omin might want to have words with them later about the dastardly way they misrepresented themselves.

After finishing up at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office, the adventurers can set off to perform their appointed mission.

> Jim Darkmagic is... uh... How do I put this? He's, uh... hmm. Let me get back to you.
> 
> - Omin Dran

## Dock Ward

Omin's assignment takes the characters to Dock Ward in Waterdeep, a maze of seedy tenements, rough streets, and even rougher alleyways. If the characters have spent time in the city, they might have heard that much of this ward is set up as safe houses, meeting places, and fronts for a variety of criminal organizations, including the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim. None of these groups are particularly happy right now, since the sinkhole caused by the earthquake opened up smack dab in the middle of their territory. The sinkhole also brought the Waterdeep City Watch to the ward, a move welcomed by no one—least of all the members of the Watch, who must now stand guard over the site until it can be investigated and closed.

A character whose background entails knowledge of the ward knows the general layout of its streets and alleys, but finding Jolly's Lamp Emporium and the abandoned warehouse requires asking for directions at some point. Use the following encounters as a general setup, but you can add additional encounters as the characters make their way through the ward as you see fit.

#### Maps and Poshuns

As the adventurers make their way through the streets of Dock Ward, they come upon an unlikely commercial venture.

> A ramshackle stall set up along the street bears a sign that reads: "Maps and Poshuns." Working the stall is a filthy but cheerful gnome urchin. Several pieces of parchment are on display in the stall, with six small ceramic pots placed next to them.

The rapscallion is Jerronimous "Jerr" Burntberry (CN male gnome commoner) who is quite a bit older than he looks. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Insight</wc-fetch>) check tips the characters off that the adult gnome is disguised to look like a youngster. Jerr hopes to join the Zhentarim one day, but he needs a little more experience. In the meantime, he makes a living by scribbling on pieces of parchment he scrounges from garbage heaps, selling them as maps to unwitting fools searching for places in Dock Ward. He also collects fetid rainwater in small, red clay pots, which leach out just enough color that he can pass the water off as _potions of healing_.

The potions have a faintly fruity aroma. A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell shows that they are indeed magical, though that magic is of the transmutation school rather than conjuration. Each day, a kindly druid who thinks Jerr is an honest soul gives the gnome a goodberry for his health. Rather than eat the berry, Jerr crushes it up and adds a drop of juice to each pot. Jerr sells maps for 1 gp and the potions for 10 gp. He also tries to sell other useless or counterfeit objects at your discretion.

If the adventurers ask Jerr to be a guide, he happily takes the job for 1 gp. He then leads the characters straight into an ambush by a gang working for the Zhentarim (see the "Skeleton Crew" encounter below). A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Insight</wc-fetch>) check is needed to see through the skilled lies of the gnome.

If you wish, Jerr can become a recurring character in the campaign. He might keep tabs on the characters as they grow famous, showing up in cities where they travel, trying to sell more useless goods, or eventually spying on them for the Zhentarim. Or if paid and treated well, he could become a valuable source of information for the characters when they need someone to infiltrate tough areas.

#### Skeleton Crew

As the characters make their way farther into Dock Ward, they encounter street thugs growing increasing resentful of the presence of the City Watch. These thugs need to earn some quick coin, then lay low until the Watch leaves the ward. And mugging the next group of distracted strangers to wander down the wrong street seems like just the ticket.

The four bandit members of the crew are run-of-the-mill criminals looking to get ahead in the world through treachery. Their leader, Jelayne, was similar... until she was killed a year before. Jelayne wasn't one to let death keep her down, however, and she continues to lead the group as an unusual skeleton with these changes:

- She has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 14 (+2).
- She can speak Common.

Jelayne isn't aware that she's undead. Even though the last of her flesh is constantly sloughing off her, she dismisses that effect as "allergies." The rest of the crew don't know what to do, since Jelayne has kept her intellect, knowledge, and personality. They have always followed her and done fine for themselves, so why let death interfere with a good thing?

When the encounter begins, read:

> A figure stands in the alleyway, its luminous eyes glowing beneath a dark hood. As the hood is pulled away to reveal a skeletal face, the figure unexpectedly speaks. "Your money or your life!"

The other members of the crew hide in adjacent alleyways or on the rooftop of a nearby building. They enter the fray if the characters don't surrender their valuables immediately.

If the adventurers defeat the crew and study Jelayne, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Religion</wc-fetch>) check confirms that she was raised as undead by a unique ritual that allowed her to keep her intellect and ability to speak. This has no bearing on the encounter, but sets up the existence of such rituals as foreshadowing for later events. See the "**area A Horse is a Corpse, of Course**" section and "**area The Magic of Convenience**" sidebar in episode 2 for more information.

The work of the gnome archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop is a constant presence in episodes 2 and 3 of the adventure, even before his actual appearance toward the end of episode 3. Savvy players might note that the undead minions Hoobur creates to harry the party don't follow the standard rules by which a spellcaster character might create undead. Likewise, some of the creatures working for Hoobur do so in ways that aren't covered by <wc-fetch type="spell">dominate monster</wc-fetch>.

If the characters develop a strong interest in creating undead horses or summoning will-o'-wisps to their service, you can decide to reveal the "unique rituals" Hoobur knows, which can show up as treasure in the adventure or be something that the characters can learn through research. Otherwise, just assume that like many classic villains, Hoobur Gran'Shoop has access to whatever magic is necessary to advance the plot in the most interesting way.

##### Treasure

In her belt pouch, Jelayne carries a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>, 10 gp, and the bones of four of her toes that have fallen off. She used to be really attached to them.

#### The Mystic

Continuing on through Dock Ward, the characters catch unexpected sight of a kidnapping.

> An old male human hobbles up the street, his long staff bearing most of his weight. His wrinkled face tells a tale of many hard years lived in poverty. As he passes an alleyway entrance, he looks up at you and grins, revealing his last few remaining teeth. But even as he opens his mouth as if to speak, a pair of meaty gray arms emerge from the alley entrance and yank him into the darkness.

The characters are 20 feet from the alley entrance when the old man—a seer named Kal Ruudheart (NG male human commoner)—is grabbed. The perpetrators are Big Gustava (NE female duergar) and her friend who goes by the name Devil Dog (CE female tiefling acolyte). The two are street thieves trying to work their way up to larger scores. Devil Dog uses the acolyte stat block with these racial traits:

- She knows the <wc-fetch type="spell">thaumaturgy</wc-fetch> cantrip, and Charisma is her spellcasting ability for this spell.
- She has resistance to fire damage.
- She has <wc-fetch type="sense">darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet.
- She speaks Common and Infernal.

Big Gustava is the muscle of the duo. Devil Dog stays out of harm's way, fleeing quickly if it looks like the situation might turn dire. She saves her spells to aid her escape rather than using them offensively.

The thugs grabbed Kal because they heard the old fool can predict the future. They don't want to hurt him, but simply hope to persuade him to help them make as much coin as possible with little risk.

##### Questioning Kal

If the characters save Kal, he looks at them with the same grin. He doesn't express gratitude, though, because his mind wanders through a different level of existence, as is the case for many mystics, celebrities, and financial planners. He laughs when asked a question. He answers questions that no one asked. He nods but says no, or vice versa, even when he has no reason to do so. However, when the second sight grips him, all that changes.

> Kal's eyes come into focus and he becomes as sober as a priest of Ilmater at sunup. "Their plans are afoot," he whispers. "Their staff are ready. Their balance sheets are totaled, and that total is grim. They mean to bring the end of all things! You must seek the magic! Only you can stop them! Only you! You... are who again, sorry?"

After this suitably dramatic and stylishly vague telegraphing of the adventure's archplot, Kal reverts to his normal abnormal state of mind for good.

##### Treasure

Gustava wears a set of stylish silver earrings worth 40 gp.

Devil Dog carries nothing of value, but in exchange for her life, she promises to take her captors back to her apartment, where she says she keeps her money. Instead of doing so, however, she leads the characters on a merry walk through the worst parts of Dock Ward, where she knows six Bandit who will attack them and allow her to flee.

## Warehouse Environs

Eventually, the characters spot the sign for Jolly's Lamp Emporium. Read the following as they move toward their goal:

> Jolly's Lamp Emporium is an unassuming, ramshackle shop in the midst of other unassuming, ramshackle shops—including the collapsed warehouse next door. People in nearby shops and apartments peer warily through their shutters as you approach. Next to the warehouse, three members of the Waterdeep City Watch stand guard. No one else is on the street, except a seemingly inebriated halfling who stumbles toward you.

#### Gray Hands Spy

The stumbling figure is Otis Adalgrim (NG male halfling spy). Otis works for the Gray Hands—members of the City Watch or the City Guard invited to join a special security force working directly for Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff of Waterdeep. The Blackstaff fears that some evil faction might have been involved in the earthquake, and she has tasked Otis with watching the area in disguise to see who comes to investigate.

Otis pretends to ignore the group, although he makes note of their presence as he staggers by. Any character who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Insight</wc-fetch>) check gets the feeling that the halfling is only acting the part of a drunken passerby. If confronted, Otis does his best to maintain the facade. He moves away from the adventurers as quickly as possible, but he circles back to watch them as they interact with the City Watch and enter the sinkhole fissure.

Otis can be used as a wild card later in this episode of the adventure. For example, if the characters are faring poorly during the encounters under the warehouse, the halfling could follow and intervene on their behalf, healing <wc-fetch type="condition">unconscious</wc-fetch> party members or dragging them away from danger. Later in the campaign, Otis might act as a recurring NPC who crosses paths with the characters while they're in Waterdeep, making sure they have information they need and don't run afoul of the law.

#### The City Watch

The three members of the City Watch standing guard at the collapsed warehouse make sure no unauthorized people enter the area. At the same time, they ensure that nothing terrible escapes from the fissure into the city.

The leader of the trio is Captain Mergen Truff (NG female elf veteran), a laconic figure who would rather be doing "real work" than standing here warning off vagrants too foolish to avoid falling into a massive hole in the ground. Her companions are Orvis Torval (N male firbolg guard) and Rosko Bosh (N male halfling guard). Orvis and Rosko are new constables, not the sharpest swords in the armory, and as lazy as wizards who've used all their spell slots. Local thieves pay them to look the other way when ordered to do so, which becomes important later in the episode.

When the characters approach, Captain Truff steps forward, tells them that the area is off-limits, and orders them to move along. When the characters get across the purpose of their presence (most easily by stating that Omin Dran sent them), Truff is clearly relieved, though still not entirely friendly.

> The captain sighs. "Took you long enough," she says. "So let's get this done so we can get on with our lives."
> 
> She pulls a scroll from a leather pack and squints at its barely legible writing. "So which one of you is Ozgood the Ugly? I need you to sign before you go in. Nothing but paperwork and signatures since the newest Masked Lords got seated on the council, but what can you do?"

![MERGEN TRUFF, ORVIS TORVAL, AND ROSKO BOSH](adventure/OoW/042-04-04.png)

##### What Was Your Name Again

Captain Truff's scroll contains the names of the members of the adventuring party that Omin Dran thought he hired to do this job. The number of names conveniently matches the number of characters, and can include any of the following:

- Ozgood the Ugly
- Carlot "Squeaky" Wickel
- "Great Maul" McTickleton
- Lord Pompy Fuggelstruck
- Squinty Pip
- Mad Haddey Flagon
- Fippance Gibberjaw

To gain access to the warehouse and the sinkhole fissure, the characters must pretend to be the named adventurers. Assume that the City Watch members know the names and reputations of some of the adventurers on the list, but have never met them in person. If a character pretends to be Lord Pompy Fuggelstruck and speaks to the guards, Captain Truff might think it odd that they aren't speaking with Fuggelstruck's well-known lisp, or predilection for using rhyming couplets, or what have you. You can let roleplaying determine the outcome, or call for DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Deception</wc-fetch>) checks for the characters to pass off any outright lies.

Captain Truff is eager to get someone—anyone—to investigate the fissure as soon as possible, allowing her to go back to her normal duties. Even if she becomes suspicious that the characters aren't the adventurers named on the scroll, as long as someone signs as Ozgood, she's content to allow them to investigate.

##### Useful Information

Once the characters' identities are "confirmed," they might have some questions for the guards. Use the following points to steer the conversation—and make sure to work in the first three points as a warning from the guards, even if the players fail to seek more information:

- The fissure opened beneath the warehouse during the earthquake two days ago. The partially collapsed building has been deemed structurally sound, so it shouldn't fall into the fissure unless someone inside does something foolish, such as knock down a support beam or bang against the remaining walls.
- The fissure has exposed access to a number of mysterious tunnels beneath the warehouse. It's not known how long the tunnels have been there, who created them, or what might be lurking within.
- The contract the characters sign is fulfilled only if they investigate and clear every tunnel the fissure exposed. After they finish, a city surveyor will be assigned to map the area, and an engineer needs to assess the integrity of the tunnels to ensure that no further collapses are imminent. If either professional is injured or killed because of negligence on the part of the adventurers, the party and Acquisitions Incorporated can be held liable.
- Two members of the City Watch—Sergeant Ava Teeshe and Constable Yander Boot—descended into the fissure a day earlier to make sure it held nothing dangerous. From the bottom of the sinkhole, they followed an underground passage north. They haven't been seen or heard from since.
- Sergeant Teeshe is a tall, strapping female human who has seen her share of scuffles and doesn't back down from a fight. If something took her out, it must be powerful.
- By contrast, Constable Boot is a runty male human, and infamous for his cowardice. However, anything that caught him while he tried to flee must be fast.
- The three guards have been ordered to remain on site until the exploration of the fissure is complete. Captain Truff is clear in articulating her hopes that the adventurers can wrap up the investigation quickly. Every second she spends in this unruly section of Dock Ward grates on her nerves.

#### Jolly's Lamp Emporium

If the characters enter this shop at any point during their time around the warehouse, they find the short, rotund proprietor standing behind a rough-hewn counter. Jolly (NE male half-orc thug) maintains this business as a front for the Xanathar Guild. The number of lamps in the so-called Lamp Emporium totals exactly six. From the looks of those wares, it's not clear that any of the lamps actually work.

Stolen coins, valuables, and other black-market goods are stored in a secret room in the back until they are ready to be sold. Guild members use the shop's other back rooms to hide from the authorities or plan jobs. At the moment, the only person in the building other than Jolly is a Xanathar Guild agent who goes by the moniker Feather (NE female half-elf assassin).

Feather is lying low after a failed assassination attempt in the South Ward the previous night (see the "**area Life in Waterdeep**" sidebar earlier in this episode), and pretends to be Jolly's assistant. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Medicine</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check allows a character to notice that Feather moves stiffly, as if her shoulder is badly injured. Before diving headlong into the events of "The Orrery of the Wanderer" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and the "Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion" section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate download—**www.dmsguild.com**) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.

Additionally, you can make use of the following rumors that characters might hear on the streets or in the taverns of that great metropolis. Some of these rumors tie to the adventure, while the truth of others depends on your wishes for the campaign. Either way, feel free to use these rumors as inspiration for new encounters or side treks.

Omin Dran is one of the fabled Masked Lords of Waterdeep. His presence on the council is the impetus for beneficial changes sweeping across the city.

Omin Dran is definitely not one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. The addition to the council of such a power-hungry and ruthless individual would spell the end of the rule of law in the City of Splendors.

The earthquake that hit the city two days ago wasn't natural. Strong magic unleashed underground caused it—maybe even magic from Undermountain.

Acquisitions Incorporated is making a play for control in the city, and the other power groups of Waterdeep are not going to let that happen without a fight. The recent hostilities between groups such as the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim have been made even worse by the increasing sway of the company.

A noble merchant in the South Ward survived an assassination attempt last night. A female half-elf was seen fleeing the scene, bearing a deep cut on her shoulder from a bodyguard's blade. A 50 gp bounty has been offered for bringing her in alive for questioning.

A killer is stalking the streets of the North Ward, murdering people in broad daylight. The victims' feet are chopped off, as if by a powerful blow with a sharp blade. Then they're decapitated. The heads are left behind, but the feet are taken!

The famous Waterdavian actor Tystanya Creed has not been seen since leaving the theatre after her last performance several days ago. Her adoring fans fear she is dead.

Towering forms in black cloaks have been seen around the City of the Dead at night. A number of witnesses swear that those cloaks and their deep hoods concealed skeletal forms.

A green dragon was spotted flying over the Sea of Swords just west of the city. The Blackstaff and her team are on high alert in case it ventures closer or harasses ships in the area.

One of the great walking statues of Waterdeep has been reported to be crying over the last three days. No one is sure about the cause of this watery discharge from the eyes, but some say it means the destruction of the City of Splendors is imminent! Others are certain it's a sign of great fortune on the horizon. Still others say it's just the humidity.

Members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters are going on strike, leaving the streets of Waterdeep dark and dangerous around the next new moon. The thieves and assassins of the city are already getting prepared for a night of carnage.

Jolly does his best to get the adventurers out of his shop as quickly as possible. If asked about the earthquake or the fissure beneath the warehouse next door, he says only that he heard the ground shake and felt the warehouse cave in. If the adventurers threaten force and succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check, they can convince Jolly to give up the one useful piece of information he knows. The tunnels beneath the warehouse were used by thieves at one time, but they were abandoned because of unknown dangers that came up from the darkness below. Jolly has no idea what those dangers might be.

## The Fissure

![undefined](adventure/OoW/043-04-05.png)

When the fissure opened up at the bottom of the sinkhole, it exposed a number of tunnels used for a variety of purposes and by a multitude of people over the years. The first of the tunnels beneath the warehouse were dug as smugglers' byways. Later, worshipers of That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the "New Race: Verdan" section in chapter 3) excavated chambers beneath the ground to hold clandestine meetings and worship at a secret shrine of destruction. Various thieves' guilds employed the tunnels to move from place to place secretly. Renegade wizards did terrible experiments there. At one point, part of the Waterdeep sewer system crossed into the tunnel network. Not long after, the subterranean spaces were abandoned.

As a result of the earthquake, many of the tunnel system's side passages have been blocked by rubble. The limited zone that is still traversable leads the characters from the fissure to the lost shrine of destruction—and through a number of dangerous areas in between.

When the adventurers enter the warehouse, read:

> In the areas where the walls and ceiling didn't collapse, this warehouse contains no crates, no boxes, no barrels, and no wares of any other kind. Directly in front of the missing door, the walls, ceiling, and floor have fallen away to reveal a deep sinkhole fissure. Inside the ruin, a hempen rope anchored firmly in the rubble dangles down into the darkness. The tear in the earth descends at an angle, making it impossible to see how far down it goes or what waits at the bottom.

Descending into the fissure is easily done by characters using the rope, but requires a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check by anyone climbing down the rough stone walls. On a failed check, a character tumbles down the sloping fissure and takes 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage.

Maps 1.2 and 1.3 show the layout of the caverns and chambers beneath the fissure.

</wc-gallery>

#### 1. Rats

When the first character reaches the bottom of the sinkhole, read:

> The sinkhole fissure ends at a level floor of worked stone. Dust, debris, rocks, and pieces of wood that once made up the walls and ceiling of the warehouse above are spread across the floor. An underground passage is blocked to the south, but it continues into darkness to the north. Two pairs of human-sized boot prints, easily spotted in the dust, head northward. Smaller fissures, holes, and cracks riddle the passage, though even a halfling would find the largest of them a tight fit.

The floor of the corridor is difficult terrain for 20 feet around the point where the characters descend.

##### Creatures

After the first character has been at the bottom of the fissure for 2 rounds, a group of six Giant Rat notices the potential feast. Any character at the bottom of the fissure who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check can hear the approaching rats, and isn't surprised when three rats emerge from cracks in the walls and attack. Three more rats arrive and attack 1 round later. All the rats are dyed a bright green from trap C in **area area 3**.

##### Treasure

When the final rat dies, it coughs up a humanoid finger bearing a platinum ring worth 20 gp. Etched inside the ring is the name "Burton Boot." The ring belonged to the father of Yander Boot, the deceased constable of the Watch, and was bitten off by the rat after Boot was killed (see **area area 5**).

#### 2. Trials

The earthquake sealed many of the passages that once made up this underground maze. As the characters explore, they pass through worked tunnels, natural caverns, and functional sewers at different points. Most side passages are blocked by rubble, making the path of the two Waterdeep City Watch guards easy to follow.

The next area of interest on the adventurers' journey is a chamber that the followers of That-Which-Endures once used as a testing ground for new recruits.

> This rectangular chamber shows no earthquake damage, possibly because of the buttresses and columns supporting the walls and ceiling. Four pools of liquid are set into the floor—one blue, another green, a third clear, and the last cloudy. Carvings on the walls seemingly depict the pools, and show robed figures submerging themselves within. At the far end of the chamber stands a double door with a large, ornately carved lock.

The pools represent the trials the characters must undertake to pass the test of That-Which-Endures. Each pool is 10 feet deep and has sheer sides. To trigger the effects of a pool, a creature must completely submerge itself in its liquid. The pools and the double door radiate transmutation to a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect.

##### Double Doors

The lock on the double doors opens with a key granted by passing the trials of the pools (see below). If the characters have that key, they can open the doors without consequences.

Opening the lock without the key requires a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch>. Any unsuccessful attempt to pick the lock triggers a trap (see below). The door cannot be broken down or otherwise smashed, and attempting to do so triggers the trap.

A successful DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check allows a character to spot faint runes etched among the ornate carvings on the lock. A subsequent DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch>) check to study the runes reveals that they can emit a wave of transmutation magic throughout the room.

##### Blue Pool

A character fully submerged in the blue pool must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw as images of horror overwhelm their mind. On a failure, the character has visions of terrible calamities such as rotting flesh, crumbling edifices, and political speeches. This trauma imposes disadvantage on initiative rolls. On a successful save, these visions put the character on edge, granting advantage on initiative rolls. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.

##### Green Pool

A character fully submerged in this pool must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw as poison courses into their body. On a failure, the character takes 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) poison damage and gains vulnerability to poison damage. On a successful save, the character takes no damage and gains resistance to poison damage. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.

##### Clear Pool

A character fully submerged in this pool must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw as the infinite possibilities of the multiverse seep into their brain. On a failure, overwhelming theoretical possibilities impose one level of <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> on the character. On a successful save, the character gains a clarity of mind that grants advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks and saving throws. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.

##### Cloudy Pool

A character fully submerged in this pool must make a DC 10 Wisdom check to endure the intense itching caused by the acid that fills it. On a failure, the character takes 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) acid damage and gains vulnerability to acid damage. On a successful save, the character takes no damage and gains resistance to acid damage. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.

##### Entropy's Parting Gift

If the same character is submerged in all four pools, that character receives the blessing of That-Which-Endures. This blessing comes in handy later in **area area 7**.

##### Key

To make the key appear, one or more characters must enter all four pools, whether the outcome is good or bad. When a character is submerged in the last pool, a silver key studded with polished red garnets appears in midair in the center of the room.

##### Door Trap

Any creature in the room when the trap on the double doors triggers must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is transformed into a poisonous snake for <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> rounds, as if affected by the <wc-fetch type="spell">polymorph</wc-fetch> spell. The snakes are compelled to attack any other creatures in the room.

##### Treasure

In addition to opening the door, the key is worth 25 gp.

> ###### Resting
> 
> No pressing matters force the characters to complete their investigation quickly. This episode is for 1st-level adventurers, and the characters are at their most vulnerable at this level. As such, it's important to allow them to take rests. However, if the players become overly cautious and attempt to take a long rest after every encounter, have wandering monsters interrupt their attempts to sleep. Any low-challenge cavern-dwelling beasts are perfect for prodding the adventurers along.

#### 3. Traps

This part of the underground complex contains a number of traps installed by the previous occupants. The traps were set up to scare people away rather than kill them. Mostly.

When the characters enter this area, read:

> As the passage runs east, it widens to thirty feet for the next ninety feet. At the far end of the area, the chamber narrows to ten feet again, with an ornate double door sealing it off.

Four different traps protect this room, with each of their areas of effect marked on the map. The magic of traps A and C can be dispelled, or can be suppressed for 1 minute with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch>) check.

##### Trap A

With a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check, a character notices that the floor in this area shows signs of charring that obscures faint runes. A weak fire trap triggers if any creature enters the area, which radiates evocation to a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect. Each creature in the area when the trap triggers takes 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) fire damage.

##### Trap B

This pit trap triggers when weight is put on it. Locating the trap requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check, but the check is made with disadvantage unless the creature making it is within 5 feet of the trap. When the pit opens, the triggering creature drops into a 10-foot-deep pit and takes 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage. The lid remains open, and the pit begins filling with water flowing up from grates in the floor—along with small, glowing blue fish. These are harmless glowing cave fish, but it takes a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Nature</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch>) check to recognize that. The fish immediately start to bite any exposed skin of a creature in the water, but the result is only healthful exfoliation.

With a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check, a character can climb the rough walls of the pit, or can stay floating while the pit fills and eventually clamber out.

##### Trap C

Nearly <wc-fetch type="condition">invisible</wc-fetch> runes cover the floor in this area. The runes radiate conjuration to a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect, or can be detected with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check. When a creature steps into the area, the runes conjure up a swirling cloud of green dye that covers each creature in the area that fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

The magical dye is nontoxic, cruelty free, pet safe, and hypoallergenic. It vanishes if an affected creature is targeted by <wc-fetch type="spell">dispel magic</wc-fetch>. Otherwise, it takes <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> months to fade, even with constant scrubbing. Additionally, any savvy thief operating in the civilized settlements of the Sword Coast recognizes that a character covered in this dye fell victim to a trap. Those thieves might target such characters as easy marks in future adventures.

##### Trap D

The area of trap D appears as normal stone, and its trigger is contained in the double door. It takes a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check to recognize subtle details in the stonework revealing the trap's area.

When any creature touches the double doors, including to pick the lock, each creature standing in area D must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to the mummy chamber (see below).

##### Double Doors

The ornate double doors here are locked, and are the trigger for trap D. They radiate conjuration to a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect. Opening the doors requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch>. The doors can also be smashed open with a successful DC 16 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check, or broken down with attacks (AC 10, 30 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).

##### Mummy Chamber

When the characters can see the chamber beyond the double doors, read:

> Slabs set along the walls of this stone chamber hold human-sized bodies wrapped from head to toe in strips of off-white cloth. Even as the doors open, these wrapped bodies begin to rise.

The cloth-wrapped bodies that first rise off the slabs and lurch toward the characters are four Zombie. But any creatures teleported by the double doors are also in this chamber, having been magically wrapped in cloth and temporarily <wc-fetch type="condition">paralyzed</wc-fetch>. When the doors are opened, each <wc-fetch type="condition">paralyzed</wc-fetch> creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can act freely. It takes an action for a creature to tear away the cloth wrappings on itself or another creature.

On a failed save, the creature is no longer <wc-fetch type="condition">paralyzed</wc-fetch> but is compelled to rise along with the zombies and move toward the doors. Characters caught by this compulsion are indistinguishable from the zombies, though they aren't forced to attack. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the creature shambles around for 1 minute.

##### Treasure

Each of the zombies wears a silver necklace worth 10 gp. Resting on one of the slabs is a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch> and a <wc-fetch type="item">spell scroll</wc-fetch> of <wc-fetch type="spell">bless</wc-fetch>.

#### 4. Tunnels

An extensive tunnel system beyond the trap room does not appear on the map. This area is a complex maze of passages crisscrossing each other, collapsed tunnels forcing the characters to take side passages, weak areas exposed by the earthquake and threatening to collapse, and so on. To successfully navigate this area, the characters must tread carefully, look for signs of previous passage and structural weakness, dodge falling rocks, and use their wits.

##### Picking Up the Trail

The characters' first task is to stay on the trail left by Sergeant Teeshe and Constable Boot. Doing so requires one character to succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch>) check. On a successful check, the characters remain safely on the trail. On a failed check, they veer off the trail at one point into an unsafe passage weakened by the earthquake. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 (<wc-roll>1d8</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage from falling rocks.

##### Clearing a Path

The trail leads to an area where a cave-in occurred sometime after Teeshe and Boot passed through. To clear the cave-in, the characters work together to move the debris and secure the passage. This task involves a group ability check in which the characters can use different ability checks and skills to represent different tasks. Moving debris requires a DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. Shoring up the passage requires a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Nature</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch>) check. The passage is cleared regardless of the result of the group check, but if more than half the characters fail the group check, each character suffers one level of <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> in the process.

##### Blood Weeds

A circular passage is overgrown with vines emerging from the walls, floor, and ceiling. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Nature</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch>) check recognizes the vines as blood weeds—a carnivorous plant that feeds on creatures by draining blood with its thorns.

![undefined](adventure/OoW/046-04-07.png)

To pass through the area, each character must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>), Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Acrobatics</wc-fetch>), or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch>) check to avoid the vines. Too many vines choke the passage for the characters to attack them effectively with weapons. However, damaging the vines with fire or cold damage from a spell of 1st level or higher gives creatures moving up the tunnel advantage on their ability checks. Each creature that fails the check takes 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) necrotic damage from the blood-draining thorns.

##### Obligatory Acid Pit

The final passageway of the maze contains a pit trap filled with weak acid and floating bones. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch>) check notices the hinged floor. With a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch>, a character can disable the trap by using shims to jam the top closed. If the check fails, the character thinks the trap was deactivated even though it wasn't.

If the trap is triggered, the first character stepping onto it falls into the acid-filled pit. Any creature that enters the pit for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there takes 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) acid damage. Climbing out of the rough-sided pit is a trivial task.

#### 5. Death

The next chamber contains the body of Constable Yander Boot. Caught in a web when fleeing from a giant spider, Boot succumbed to the spider's poison. His corpse now hangs suspended from the ceiling, wrapped in webs.

When the characters enter the chamber, read:

> The passage expands into a natural cavern whose ceiling is obscured by thick, dusty webs. Five web cocoons hang down from the larger mass, their bottoms dangling ten feet above the cavern floor. Two cocoons—one larger and one smaller—have a suspiciously humanoid shape.

##### Creature

The giant spider hides in a dust-filled depression in the floor. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check spots the arachnid before it springs from its hiding place to attack. Any characters who are focused on the webs above them have disadvantage on the check. Those who fail the check are surprised.

The giant spider initially favors its web attack, hoping to restrain a couple of characters before it starts biting. If reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, the spider retreats into a nearby narrow fissure. However, it attacks again when the characters come back through this area.

##### Treasure

If the characters cut down the web cocoons, they find the corpses of three giant rats, Constable Boot, and a kobold explorer. The kobold has a <wc-fetch type="item">Acid (vial)</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="item">Alchemist's Fire (flask)</wc-fetch>, and a <wc-fetch type="item">Antitoxin (vial)</wc-fetch>. The deceased Boot has a <wc-fetch type="item">Holy Water (flask)</wc-fetch> and a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>.

</wc-gallery>

#### 6. Goblin

When Caerhan Coalsmith ventured into these caverns, his goblin sidekick Gorkoh (N male goblin) came with him. Caerhan and the other members of his adventuring party had spared Gorkoh's life a few months back when they cleared out a temple to Maglubiyet, the chief of the goblin gods. Caerhan saw potential for the goblin to become a productive member of society, so he became a friend and mentor to Gorkoh, and encouraged him to learn about magic. Caerhan has also encouraged Gorkoh to expand his Common vocabulary, with inconsistent results.

Since becoming separated from Caerhan during a carrion crawler attack, Gorkoh has hidden here waiting for his mentor to return. He is starting to fear (rightfully) that Caerhan is dead, however, and if the characters treat him kindly, he might be convinced to join them. Gorkoh carries standard goblin weapons, plus three <wc-fetch type="item">Potion of Healing</wc-fetch> and a <wc-fetch type="item">spell scroll</wc-fetch> of <wc-fetch type="spell">fog cloud</wc-fetch> that Caerhan gave him for safekeeping and study.

When the characters enter this chamber, read:

> The passage widens into a natural cavern dotted with stalactites and stalagmites. It continues on to the northeast, but the uneven walls make it hard to see into that section—even as heap of bones and gear is plainly visible.

Gorkoh hides behind one of the smaller stalagmites in the southeast section of the cavern. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check spots him hiding there. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Insight</wc-fetch>) check can tell that the goblin is watching the group with trepidation. If the characters let Gorkoh know they see him, he quickly steps forth.

> The goblin emerges from behind a stalagmite and brandishes a gnarled piece of bleached wood. "I am a powerful wizard. My wand annihilates all those who make me uptight. Go away. Leave Gorkoh alone, and there's no annihilate. Gorkoh is merciful." He thrusts his wand several times in your direction.

Gorkoh continues to bluff, pretending his gnarled stick of polished driftwood is a magic wand. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Insight</wc-fetch>) check can tell that Gorkoh is bluffing. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character can intuit that Gorkoh is terrified. If anyone makes even the slightest effort to reassure Gorkoh that they have no plans to hurt him, the goblin relaxes.

If the characters engage Gorkoh in conversation, he tells of how he and Caerhan came to these caverns in search of a lost shrine, and how Caerhan's goal was to destroy some old magic relic. Regarding the relic, Gorkoh knows only that it's "some broken clock thing," and that it was responsible for killing the other members of Caerhan's party. He tells of how the two became separated during a carrion crawler attack in the cavern just beyond this one. Caerhan must have escaped deeper into the tunnels, but Gorkoh wasn't willing to risk facing the monster to follow.

If on friendly terms with the characters (or if he needs to offer up information to save his skin), Gorkoh can offer advice on the best way to deal with the carrion crawler, pointing out a fragile and sharp stalactite cluster at a narrow point leading into the next cavern. If the characters lure the creature under the cluster, they might be able to think of some way to drop the sharp rocks on the crawler.

If the characters try to hurt or intimidate Gorkoh, he attempts to send them into the carrion crawler's domain unprepared, hoping that the monster takes care of them.

##### Creature

The carrion crawler waits in the next area, resting after taking a beating from Caerhan. The creature has only 20 hit points remaining, but it's hungry and angry. It attacks if any character enters the next cavern, and pursues characters who flee in any direction.

![GORKOH](adventure/OoW/049-04-08.png)

##### Weak Ceiling

The sharp stalactites in the passage between the two chambers were weakened by the earthquake. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Nature</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch>) check can spot the danger zone if Gorkoh didn't tell the group about it. As an action, a character can strike the ceiling with a weapon or an appropriate tool, or with a spell that deals force or thunder damage. Doing so brings down the ceiling in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. Any creature caught in the shower of razor-sharp stones must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (<wc-roll>4d6</wc-roll>) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Treasure

The bones and gear to the northeast are the remains of a group of adventurers who fell victim to the carrion crawler months ago. A backpack and a belt pouch hold 47 gp and a large polished red garnet worth 50 gp. Sticking out of the pile of bones is a <wc-fetch type="item">+1 longsword</wc-fetch>. The hilt of the sword is fashioned like a skeletal hand, and a skull-and-bones motif is prominent in the design of the weapon.

##### Gorkoh's Future

Provided the characters treat Gorkoh well, he's willing to serve the group as a hireling. In return for food and lodging, he becomes a reliable and enterprising employee.

On the other hand, if the characters mistreat him or regularly put him in danger, Gorkoh abandons them. If that happens, another goblin named Splugoth the Returned approaches Gorkoh with alternative employment. Gorkoh can show up later in the adventure as a servant of the Six, having gained new powers and seeking vengeance on those who mistreated him. See "Factions and Rivals" in chapter 3 for more information on the Six, and appendix B for more information on Splugoth.

#### 7. Stomp

When the characters can see into this chamber, read:

> This enormous chamber is roughly circular with a high ceiling. A huge granite block is suspended near the ceiling in the center of the room, carved into the rough shape of what looks like a giant foot. Runes scribed into the north and south walls of the chamber create the outline image of a bare footprint.
> 
> Scattered about the room are hundreds of rotting severed feet from countless types of humanoids. All the feet are bare. Despite the horrid wounds that severed the feet, you see no blood anywhere.

##### Creatures

Ten of the feet in the room are stomping feet, the lesser known and smellier cousins to the crawling claw. A stomping foot uses the crawling claw stat block with these changes:

- Its speed is 30 feet and it has no climbing speed.
- Its claw attack becomes a stomp attack that deals bludgeoning damage.

When any creature reaches the center of the room, the feet attack.

##### The Big Foot

When the Stomping Foot attack, the suspended granite block activates, then acts on initiative count 0 each round. This magical hazard was created to crash down upon those who lack devotion to That-Which-Endures. As such, the Big Foot ignores any creature that gained the blessing of That-Which-Endures by submerging in all four pools in area 2. It targets one random creature each round, which must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage. The Big Foot ceases attacking if all the stomping feet are slain.

The rune-graven footprints on the north and south walls power the magic of the Big Foot. A character can deactivate the magic of the runes by standing within 5 feet of a footprint and using an action to succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Religion</wc-fetch>) check. Alternatively, a character who places their own bare foot on the wall inside the rune-marked footprint automatically succeeds at deactivating those runes. Deactivating both footprints halts the Big Foot's attacks.

##### Development

A murderer in Waterdeep has been killing people, taking their feet, and placing them on an altar hidden in the city as a sacrifice to That-Which-Endures. (A hint of the killings is noted in the "**area Life in Waterdeep**" sidebar earlier in this episode.) Any feet placed on the altar teleport to this room. By placing clues on the feet that lead to the murderer, you can create a side trek mystery for the characters. You can also have two more feet suddenly appear in midair near the ceiling, then drop into the room as the adventurers fight. Before diving headlong into the events of "The Orrery of the Wanderer" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and the "Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion" section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate download—**www.dmsguild.com**) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.

Additionally, you can make use of the following rumors that characters might hear on the streets or in the taverns of that great metropolis. Some of these rumors tie to the adventure, while the truth of others depends on your wishes for the campaign. Either way, feel free to use these rumors as inspiration for new encounters or side treks.

Omin Dran is one of the fabled Masked Lords of Waterdeep. His presence on the council is the impetus for beneficial changes sweeping across the city.

Omin Dran is definitely not one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. The addition to the council of such a power-hungry and ruthless individual would spell the end of the rule of law in the City of Splendors.

The earthquake that hit the city two days ago wasn't natural. Strong magic unleashed underground caused it—maybe even magic from Undermountain.

Acquisitions Incorporated is making a play for control in the city, and the other power groups of Waterdeep are not going to let that happen without a fight. The recent hostilities between groups such as the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim have been made even worse by the increasing sway of the company.

A noble merchant in the South Ward survived an assassination attempt last night. A female half-elf was seen fleeing the scene, bearing a deep cut on her shoulder from a bodyguard's blade. A 50 gp bounty has been offered for bringing her in alive for questioning.

A killer is stalking the streets of the North Ward, murdering people in broad daylight. The victims' feet are chopped off, as if by a powerful blow with a sharp blade. Then they're decapitated. The heads are left behind, but the feet are taken!

The famous Waterdavian actor Tystanya Creed has not been seen since leaving the theatre after her last performance several days ago. Her adoring fans fear she is dead.

Towering forms in black cloaks have been seen around the City of the Dead at night. A number of witnesses swear that those cloaks and their deep hoods concealed skeletal forms.

A green dragon was spotted flying over the Sea of Swords just west of the city. The Blackstaff and her team are on high alert in case it ventures closer or harasses ships in the area.

One of the great walking statues of Waterdeep has been reported to be crying over the last three days. No one is sure about the cause of this watery discharge from the eyes, but some say it means the destruction of the City of Splendors is imminent! Others are certain it's a sign of great fortune on the horizon. Still others say it's just the humidity.

Members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters are going on strike, leaving the streets of Waterdeep dark and dangerous around the next new moon. The thieves and assassins of the city are already getting prepared for a night of carnage.

#### 8. Tentacle

When the characters investigate this chamber, read:

> The tunnel opens into a round room. Dirty brown water—sewage, judging by the smell—streams from pipes in the ceiling into a massive cesspool at the center of the room. A ten-foot-wide walkway skirts the pool, leading to a passageway on the other side.

##### Cesspool

Untold numbers of sewer pipes from the city empty their waste here. The first 10 feet of the cesspool are only 3 feet deep, but the inner area is 10 feet deep.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">History</wc-fetch>) check recalls this bizarre cesspool as the experiment of an ambitious Masked Lord of Waterdeep from decades ago. After locating a gate to a demiplane of filth, the Masked Lord attempted to build a sewer system that could empty the city's waste into that plane. It worked well, and plans were made to expand the sewer system beyond the prototype. But then creatures native to the plane of filth came through the gate in the wrong direction. After hiring mercenaries to drive the creatures back, the city rulers abandoned the plan, and the gate was sealed.

Or at least that's what everyone thought. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="skill">Nature</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type="skill">Religion</wc-fetch>) check can sense that planar magic still fills this area. The stones of the cesspool likewise radiate conjuration to a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect.

![undefined](adventure/OoW/050-04-10.png)

##### Creature

A massive creature on the demiplane of filth has reached a long tentacle through the weak planar barrier here. The creature's <wc-fetch type="sense">tremorsense</wc-fetch> allows it to detect the presence of creatures in this room, at which point it attacks. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check to notice ripples on the cesspool before the tentacle emerges. If the characters know the room's story or sensed the magic here, they have advantage on the check. The tentacle surprises anyone who fails the check.

The enormous tentacle uses the stat block of a giant constrictor snake with these changes:

- It can reach anywhere inside this room.
- It has no bite attack.

A creature <wc-fetch type="condition">grappled</wc-fetch> by the tentacle is pulled immediately into the 3-foot-deep section of the cesspool. On the next round, if the creature is still <wc-fetch type="condition">grappled</wc-fetch>, the tentacle pulls it into the 10-foot-deep section and under the sewage. There, the tentacle has three-quarters cover, and the creature can't breathe. A creature that falls <wc-fetch type="condition">unconscious</wc-fetch> while <wc-fetch type="condition">grappled</wc-fetch> beneath the sewage is pulled through the planar rupture into the filth plane, to be devoured and lost forever. Or, in grand Acquisitions Incorporated fashion, a character so destroyed might return later as a vile creature bent on revenge against its former party members.

#### 9. Dragon

A wyrmling brass dragon wound up in this cavern after a green dragon chased it away from its territory. (This is the green dragon mentioned in the "**area Life in Waterdeep**" sidebar.) The wyrmling, which calls itself Dabshabah, entered a sea cave near Waterdeep that contained a passage leading to this complex of tunnels and caverns. She was hiding when the earthquake struck, and was trapped beneath fallen rubble.

Before diving headlong into the events of "The Orrery of the Wanderer" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and the "Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion" section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate download—**www.dmsguild.com**) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.

Additionally, you can make use of the following rumors that characters might hear on the streets or in the taverns of that great metropolis. Some of these rumors tie to the adventure, while the truth of others depends on your wishes for the campaign. Either way, feel free to use these rumors as inspiration for new encounters or side treks.

Omin Dran is one of the fabled Masked Lords of Waterdeep. His presence on the council is the impetus for beneficial changes sweeping across the city.

Omin Dran is definitely not one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. The addition to the council of such a power-hungry and ruthless individual would spell the end of the rule of law in the City of Splendors.

The earthquake that hit the city two days ago wasn't natural. Strong magic unleashed underground caused it—maybe even magic from Undermountain.

Acquisitions Incorporated is making a play for control in the city, and the other power groups of Waterdeep are not going to let that happen without a fight. The recent hostilities between groups such as the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim have been made even worse by the increasing sway of the company.

A noble merchant in the South Ward survived an assassination attempt last night. A female half-elf was seen fleeing the scene, bearing a deep cut on her shoulder from a bodyguard's blade. A 50 gp bounty has been offered for bringing her in alive for questioning.

A killer is stalking the streets of the North Ward, murdering people in broad daylight. The victims' feet are chopped off, as if by a powerful blow with a sharp blade. Then they're decapitated. The heads are left behind, but the feet are taken!

The famous Waterdavian actor Tystanya Creed has not been seen since leaving the theatre after her last performance several days ago. Her adoring fans fear she is dead.

Towering forms in black cloaks have been seen around the City of the Dead at night. A number of witnesses swear that those cloaks and their deep hoods concealed skeletal forms.

A green dragon was spotted flying over the Sea of Swords just west of the city. The Blackstaff and her team are on high alert in case it ventures closer or harasses ships in the area.

One of the great walking statues of Waterdeep has been reported to be crying over the last three days. No one is sure about the cause of this watery discharge from the eyes, but some say it means the destruction of the City of Splendors is imminent! Others are certain it's a sign of great fortune on the horizon. Still others say it's just the humidity.

Members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters are going on strike, leaving the streets of Waterdeep dark and dangerous around the next new moon. The thieves and assassins of the city are already getting prepared for a night of carnage.

When the characters enter the chamber from the south, Dabshabah is fending off a pair of darkmantles, so they can hear the fight before they see it.

> A small, brass-colored dragon thrashes madly at the far end of the cavern, trapped beneath two large boulders that block a northern tunnel. Two dark creatures resembling flying squids dart just out of the little dragon's reach, harassing it. Another northern tunnel is also blocked with rubble. Only a tunnel to the east stands clear of debris.

##### Creatures

The two Darkmantle understand that the dragon is doomed to eventually die of its wounds, and that they can have an easy meal in a few hours if they bide their time. They are thus staying out of the dragon's reach. Dabshabah can't use her breath weapon against the darkmantles because the weight of the boulders makes it hard for her to breathe.

When the characters engage the darkmantles, the monsters ignore the dragon to focus on the new threat. Both creatures fight to the death.

##### Aftermath

If the characters defeat the darkmantles, Dabshabah (a brass dragon wyrmling) is thankful. If they use magic to heal the wounds she suffered during the earthquake, she is even more grateful. However, she expresses that gratitude with an inflated sense of her importance in the world. Remember that dragons aren't like people. Even the good ones can be haughty, proud, entitled, demanding, self-involved, and <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch> to violence. (Okay, maybe they are like people.)

Dabshabah is less than a year old, and she shares the story of how a green dragon attacked her and her siblings, driving her away from her mother's territory and down the Sword Coast. She can also confirm that she saw an armed and armored female human—Sergeant Ava Teeshe—pass through this chamber and head east some hours ago. Dabshabah kept silent, fearing the human would slay her.

##### Ahghairon's Dragonward

Waterdeep is protected by a magical ward that keeps dragons from entering the city. The ward doesn't reach this far below ground, so Dabshabah is safe here. However, if the characters attempt to bring her out of the fissure, she can't follow them. The dragon whines and sobs when it becomes clear that the characters must leave her behind. Arranging to meet somewhere outside the city quiets her, but Dabshabah demands assurances that the party won't abandon her.

> ###### A Powerful Pet
> 
> It might be fun to run Dabshabah as an NPC member of the party for a bit. However, any dragon—even a chaotic good wyrmling—can be tough to manage. Townsfolk are likely to be terrified at the prospect of a dragon coming into their shops and taverns. Moreover, caring for Dabshabah to her own high standards, including meeting her needs for sustenance and treasure, is equivalent to maintaining a character in a wealthy lifestyle.
> 
> That said, having Dabshabah stay with the party for a short time, then take off on her own to learn the business of being a dragon, could provide a bit of poignant narrative in your campaign. Much later on, if the characters are ever facing long odds in an important battle, Dabshabah might swoop down from the sky to return the favor the heroes once did for her.

#### 10. Shrine of Destruction

In this final area of the caverns, the characters discover the missing City Watch guard, the dead dwarf who caused all this mess—and a magical mystery that kicks off the rest of the adventure. When the characters enter this area, read:

> This crumbling chamber is dominated by an altar against the far wall, above which hangs some kind of construct gearwork mechanism ending in a massive maul. The wall to the left of the altar has fallen in to spread rubble across the floor. On the floor near the altar is a golden device resembling an orrery housing. The device is battered and falling apart, revealing exposed gears and spokes, and with its exterior pieces and plating scattered across the floor. Splayed on the ground next to the device is the corpse of a dwarf.
> 
> In the southwest corner of the room stands a muscular female human dressed in the livery of the Waterdeep City Watch. Her eyes are closed, and she breathes deeply as though resting.

The dead dwarf is Caerhan Coalsmith. Sergeant Teeshe stands in the corner. The magical housing of the <wc-fetch type="item">Orrery of the Wanderer</wc-fetch> sits before the altar.

##### Creatures

Teeshe touched the altar when she first entered this area, and a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures possessed her (see below). If the adventurers touch or disturb anything in this chamber (including the altar, the gearwork maul, or Teeshe herself), the spirit controlling Sergeant Teeshe forces her to attack. Use the thug stat block for her in this state.

##### Entropy Guardian

The gearwork device above the altar is called an entropy guardian, and it animates 1 round after Teeshe attacks. The entropy guardian's expanding clockwork arms allow it to attack anywhere in the room, but it cannot attack beyond it. On initiative count 10, it makes two attacks per round: +4 to hit, 7 (<wc-roll>1d8 + 2</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage. The damaged entropy guardian is a Huge object with AC 18, 32 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It focuses its attacks on intruders within 5 feet of the altar, anyone fighting with Sergeant Teeshe, and anyone holding the orrery housing (which its magic recognizes as an ongoing threat).

##### Altar

The altar is made of granite and covered in runes. It accepts offerings by destroying them with the attacks of the entropy guardian, representing the entropic power of That-Which-Endures. However, the ancient altar malfunctioned when Caerhan set the orrery housing on it—or perhaps the orrery channeled its own powerful magic to destroy the altar in self-defense. Either way, that pulse of power caused the earthquake, and saw the entropy guardian slay the unfortunate Caerhan when it took him as a threat to the shrine.

A character who touches the altar willingly must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be <wc-fetch type="condition">charmed</wc-fetch> by a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures. While <wc-fetch type="condition">charmed</wc-fetch> in this way, the character must use its action each turn to attack any creature defiling the shrine. This effect lasts for as long as the affected creature remains in this area, but the compulsion also prevents the creature from leaving the shrine.

##### Sergeant Teeshe

The City Watch officer is under the sway of a possessing spirit from the altar, as noted above. She attacks any creatures that appear to be a threat to the shrine, but a successful DC 13 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Insight</wc-fetch>) check allows a character to see the unfocused look in her eyes, as if she's not in control of her actions. If she can be removed from this area, the altar's power over her ends, and Teeshe comes back to her right mind. If the characters save her, the sergeant offers a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch> in thanks. She doesn't remember what happened to her after entering the tunnels with Constable Boot, and is keen to accompany the characters back out.

##### Development

If a character tries to identify the runes on the altar, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Religion</wc-fetch>) check determines only that they are connected to no known deity, but that their symbology associates them with the power of destruction and ruin. The magic of the altar and the gearwork maul is faltering, but would once have been capable of destroying even powerful magic items.

Any character who succeeds on the above check or on a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check to study the destruction here determines that a powerful pulse of magical power centered in this area is likely what caused the earthquake. The character also intuits that with the shrine's destructive magic curtailed by the earthquake, it is no longer a threat.

##### The Orrery

The <wc-fetch type="item">Orrery of the Wanderer</wc-fetch> is a powerful magic artifact, detailed in appendix D. In its present state, the orrery has been battered by the entropy guardian, though its six-sided form remains intact. Its side plating is mostly missing, but can be collected from the floor nearby. If characters replace any of the shattered side plating, it magically reattaches itself. More oddly, if the characters don't replace the plating, it begins to regrow, even as the orrery housing magically straightens itself out.

Within a few days, the orrery housing is a pristine, golden six-sided device with a circular hole in each face. The setup of gears and attachments within the orrery makes it clear that six round components are meant to be placed into the device. Characters will not recall seeing any such devices in the shrine of destruction.

## Exiting the Fissure

With Sergeant Teeshe saved (or with her body in tow and a convenient cover story), the characters can make their way back to the sinkhole. If they left any dangers behind them on their initial pass, those dangers reemerge on the trip back—and will prevent them from fulfilling their contract if not eliminated.

When the characters climb out of the sinkhole, Captain Truff is waiting for them alone, and is pleased to see them. She's even more pleased if the characters rescued Sergeant Teeshe. Truff asks the characters to sign an affidavit confirming that they've completely investigated and cleared the passages beyond the fissure. If the characters lie about the success of their mission, they risk a fine, imprisonment, or both.

The characters must also agree to have all the goods they found beneath the city inventoried. If anyone later claims to be the rightful owner of any of the loot, a magistrate might rule that the goods belong to the original owner instead of the characters. Who knew adventuring required so much paperwork?

#### Dock Ward Ambush

While the NPCs and characters are going over their bookkeeping, a group of villains working for the Xanathar Guild tries to take any treasure the party pulled out of the tunnels. The group consists of a thug called Stork leading three Bandit. Stork believes she has the advantage over the party members, who are probably coming out of the tunnels bruised and bloodied. Plus, she's already bribed the two City Watch guards, Orvis Torval and Rosko Bosh, to "take a walk," so neither is on hand during the attack.

Captain Truff fights alongside the characters, as do Gorkoh and Sergeant Teeshe if the characters rescued them. Otis Adalgrim might show up too, either during or after the fight.

## Conclusion

With this first episode completed, the characters attain 2nd level! But even as they get to bask in the warm glow of that achievement, they must return to Acquisitions Incorporated to report. Omin Dran is there to meet with them when they do. If the characters were successful and dealt with Captain Truff in good faith, Omin gives them the promised reward of 400 gp for the group (500 gp minus the Acquisitions Incorporated fee). If the characters were only partly successful, adjust Omin's reaction and what follows as necessary.

Having since learned about the initial mistaken identity when he met the characters, Omin is even more impressed by their success. Or he might be in the mood to demand favors from them if things didn't go entirely as planned (because that kind of mess makes the whole company look bad). Either way, read:

> "I've been told about the misunderstanding regarding your identities. I can't say much for your relative inexperience and lack of skill. But it looks as though you've got enough moxie to cover for that. And a willingness to do what it takes to get ahead. Those are traits we hold in high regard here at Acquisitions Incorporated."
> 
> Omin pulls a map from a satchel and places it on the conference room's oak table. "You know the town of Phandalin? Just off the Triboar Trail? A few months back, we awarded a group a franchise there. We received word that they were taking control of some ruined estate for their headquarters, and everything seemed to be going well. Only they missed this month's franchise payment, and their secretarian isn't answering any calls."
> 
> Omin snaps his fingers, and a paper, a pen, and an ink pot leap from his satchel. "This note gives you the right to travel to Phandalin and investigate the franchise there on my behalf. If you find the franchise in poor standing or otherwise in distress, I want a full report. And depending on how badly the last group botched things, I might look to you to take over. A failed franchise makes the whole company look bad. I'm sure you understand."
> 
> Omin then levels a hard stare. "I want you to appreciate what an incredible opportunity this is for you. You're skipping countless steps in the normal franchise process. No internships. No tests. It's unheard of. But I believe in you."

As before, Omin Dran is a busy CEO, and doesn't have time for a lot of questions. If the characters discuss finding the mysterious orrery housing, he tells them to make researching the relic part of their mission. With the characters all newly minted, official Acquisitions Incorporated employees, Omin trusts that they'll know what to do.

## Franchise Downtime

Once the characters formally establish their franchise at the end of episode 2, downtime activities and franchise tasks will play a bigger role in the adventure. For now, though, encouraging the players to engage in downtime activities before heading off for Phandalin can help them get comfortable with the idea of dedicating nonadventuring time to personal and business development.

A few possible downtime activities are suggested below, but the party's downtime escapades can include anything that you and the players come up with.

#### The Orrery

Learning more about the mysterious orrery could be undertaken as basic research, which might lead later to a more thorough investigation with the scrutineering activity (see "Franchise Tasks and Downtime" in chapter 2). Whatever approach the characters take, remember that learning the full scope of the orrery's history, the secrets of its creator, and the range of its powers is the goal of the whole campaign. Whatever small bits of information can be revealed at the outset should hint at even more that remains to be discovered.

#### Dragonsitting

If the players helped Dabshabah, they might want to check up on the wyrmling. Helping her fully heal up and regain the use of her fire breath and sleep breath might require research or a customized use of the recuperating downtime activity (both from the Player's Handbook.) If the characters want to arrange for someone else to watch over the young dragon, finding a suitable guardian might require research. Or the characters might decide to sow positive rumors in the area where the dragon wants to settle (using the sowing rumors activity from the Dungeon Master's Guide), hoping to get the locals used to the idea.

#### Altared States

Characters interested in the strange altar under Waterdeep can undertake research to study its mysterious runes, which can lead to information regarding That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the "New Race: Verdan" section in chapter 3.) Gorkoh the goblin might assist with this task if the characters keep him around, as a kind of warm-up for the rules for letting NPCs run franchise tasks (which the characters will gain access to at the end of episode 2).

In the long term, Gorkoh could take the lead in the scrutineering activity to research the shrine, or set up a shady business practice to restore part of the altar's power and arrange clandestine tours into the caverns by those who want other dangerous relics destroyed. See "Franchise Tasks and Downtime" in chapter 2 for more information on those new activities.

## Continuing the Adventure

With contracts in hand and downtime done, the characters can make the trek from Waterdeep to Phandalin. Episode 2 of this adventure details that trip and the new mysteries the characters encounter as they arrive in town, attempt to sort out what happened to the previous franchise—and start to build their own franchise as the newest members of Acquisitions Incorporated!
