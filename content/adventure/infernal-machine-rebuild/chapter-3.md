}

The Tomb of Horrors is one of the most legendary dungeons in the multiverse. Shaped by the demilich Acererak as a testing ground for would-be heroes—and as a place to steal the souls of those heroes whose skills where found wanting—the tomb has claimed countless lives over millennia, and even some of the most hardened adventurers would think twice about entering those deadly halls. But by going back into the past, the characters have a chance to explore a version of the Tomb of Horrors that few have ever seen, and to engage one of the world's deadliest dungeons on their own terms.

## Background

According to legend, Acererak was a tiefling fathered by a balor named Tarnhem. In his youth, he studied spellcasting under Vecna, and has since become an archmage of surpassing evil. While researching the means to achieve lichdom, Acererak built a number of dungeons and tombs, including his famed Tomb of Horrors. Those dungeons were created partly as a means to draw out and defeat those adventurers driven to seek and destroy him—and partly to claim those adventurers' souls to feed his phylactery.

Even after Acererak eventually became an archlich whose dark plots would threaten the world, he left behind the Tomb of Horrors as a monument to his greatness. But in its earliest stages, the tomb was a very different sort of place.

By traveling to the Tomb of Horrors in the past, the characters arrive with the place still under construction. The artificer Moghadam serves as the tomb's chief architect, overseeing its construction in initial areas dug out by enthralled umber hulks and refined by master artisans. As part of the unprecedented levels of magic used to create the deadly traps in the Tomb of Horrors, Moghadam has installed several of the missing components from the _Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad_ at the site. These components are used to draw magical energy from the life force of creatures sacrificed on Acererak's orders—including the archmage's own father, the balor Tarnhem.

Over the years of the tomb's construction, Moghadam and his rival artificer, Thessalar, have competed fiercely against each other's endeavors. Moghadam takes pleasure in having lured away several sculptors from Thessalar's temple to help with the tomb's construction. He has also recently sent a party of thieves and a master gemsmith to his rival's temple, instructing them to steal the temple's two most famous gems—set into the eyes of a great statue of Moloch—for use in the creation of Acererak's jeweled demilich skull. Unfortunately, those thieves have failed to return, and are presumed captured by Thessalar.

## Who Dwells Here?

This version of the Tomb of Horrors takes place in the distant past, when various legendary figures of in-game history (Acererak included) still operate as mere mortals. Several of such figures have been included as NPCs, but you should not treat this adventure's approach to those characters as canon. Rather, use them to flesh out this particular adventure in "what-if" fashion. Alternatively, if you prefer not to populate the adventure with such prominent names, you can substitute those characters with unnamed general NPCs who can fill the same roles.

Some of the NPCs in this section of the adventure (including Moghadam) are a much more potent threat than characters of the lower levels suggested for the adventure can safely deal with. The players should be forewarned that their characters should treat with such legendary figures carefully—a warning that is repeated by whichever agent the characters are dealing with.

### Moghadam

A legendary evil human artificer, Moghadam has long sought out interesting challenges for his immense intellect. As such, he considers the design of the Tomb of Horrors to be his masterwork. If questioned about his motivations, he claims that Acererak took his family hostage, and will not release them until Moghadam completes his work. The truth is that the artificer has no family. He delights in creating despair, and works on the tomb in the hope that his name will go down alongside Acererak's in legend.

Moghadam competes with a rival artificer named Thessalar, who operates out of a temple dedicated to Moloch some distance away. Moghadam has lured away several of Thessalar's expert sculptors to come work on the tomb, promising them great wealth that he has no intention of paying. More recently, the architect sent his own expert gemsmith along with a group of thieves to the Temple of Moloch, so that they might steal the gemstone eyes from its most famous statue. However, the thieves were captured, and Moghadam is now without the gemstones or his gemsmith, and plots the means to seize both.

See appendix B for Moghadam stat block.

### Nolzur

Fated to one day become a spellcaster of great renown, Nolzur (a neutral male human master thief) has not yet begun to hone his magical art in this time, but has already started a specialization in alchemy that will one day lead to the crafting of such items as his famed <wc-fetch type="item">Nolzur's marvelous pigments</wc-fetch>. In this age, Nolzur most recently studied with Thessalar, learning secrets of alchemy and infusing his own blood with strange and dangerous properties. Moghadam learned of all this and captured Nolzur. He is now held in the tomb, with his blood used as a base material for magic pigments.

> #### Who's Who
> 
> According to game lore, Nolzur belonged to the Company of Seven, a famed group of adventurers whose names are immortalized in spells, artifacts, and magic items such as <wc-fetch type="item">Keoghtom's ointment</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">Quaal's feather token</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="item">Heward's handy haversack</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="spell">Tasha's hideous laughter</wc-fetch>. Nolzur was a noted thief, illusionist, and alchemist, most famous for creating <wc-fetch type="item">Nolzur's marvelous pigments</wc-fetch>.

### Pentival

A lawful good male half-dragon paladin in the service of Pelor, Pentival ventured to the tomb worksite along with several fellow paladins, drawn by rumors of a powerful balor bound there. Acererak spread these rumors, relying on combat between Pentival and Tarnhem to weaken them both, after which he could capture and imprison them for his own purposes.

Pentival uses the half-red dragon veteran stat block, but has the form of a gold dragon. He can be found in the chapel of evil (**area area 14**), forced to take part in the evil ceremony there. Though Pentival has been forced to watch his fellow paladins succumb one by one to the ceremony, he has so far held out, his devotion somehow keeping him alive.

### Phenex

An incubus cleric of Vecna, Phenex came to this world by way of the jungles of Chult. He first occupied an abandoned temple filled with girallons, where Acererak found and recruited him with promises of power and glory.

Although Phenex remains fanatically loyal to Vecna (even to the point of removing one of his eyes and his left hand), Acererak finds him useful to his own cause as well. (The mortal Acererak still ostensibly pledges his own faith to Vecna at this time.) Since arriving at the tomb along with many of his girallons, Phenex has magically grafted on a second set of arms, making him resemble something of a girallon himself. 

### Tarnhem

A powerful balor and Acererak's father, Tarnhem has been tricked into imprisonment by his son. Above all else, the demon desires his freedom, and is willing to promise anything to those who can offer it to him.

## Missing Components

The missing components of the _Infernal Machine_ at this location can be found in the chapel of evil (**area area 14**), worked into the altar. They resemble the components found at the clock tower in chapter 1, being gemstone-like buttons made of some unknown material, all a deep sapphire blue.

## Mechanical Guide

If the characters' mechanical guide is lost or destroyed while they explore the Tomb of Horrors, you can make use of a number of options to keep the characters from remaining stranded in the past. Moghadam might offer to repair or rebuild the guide for a suitable price, and Thessalar makes the same offer if an overland trek is made to reach him. (The sculptors in the tomb possess maps showing the way to the Temple of Moloch.) Tarnhem might also be able to help restore a fallen guide using his powerful fiendish magic, but only if the characters are willing to make a deal with the demon and free him.

## Exploring the Tomb

Compared to the original Tomb of Horrors adventure, this version of the tomb is still in the early stages of its construction. Areas 1 to 18 match the well-known maps of the tomb closely, but the sections of the tomb beyond those areas have not yet been constructed.

Numbered locations are keyed to the map on page 18.

### Hillside

From the characters' arrival point, a busy vista unfolds at the construction site.

> Construction of the Tomb of Horrors is well underway, focused on three tunnels being dug into the north end of a flat-topped hill covered in ugly weeds, thorns, and briars. An active workers' camp occupies the north end of the hill, above the tunnels.

The rocky hill into which the tomb is being built is approximately six hundred feet wide, nine hundred feet long, and sixty feet high. Characters who ascend the hill to search the top discover a number of large black rocks dumped there. (The rocks will later be placed into the pattern of a grinning humanoid skull). A successful DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="skill">Nature</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type="skill">Religion</wc-fetch>) check identifies the rocks as the remains of living creatures that have been reshaped to stone by dark magic. (These are the remains of worshipers from **area area 14**.)

#### Entrance Portals

The three openings across the north side of the hill lead to areas 1 to 3. With a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check, characters atop the hill can observe umber hulks and their handlers traveling to and from **area area 2**, and humanoid workers moving to and from **area area 3**. **area Area 1** appears deserted.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes several workers to emerge from inside the tomb, hauling a large black rock to add to the pile atop the hill.

### Workers' Camp

A number of tents along the north side of the hill house the tomb's workers, their food storage, equipment depots, latrines, and so forth. These workers include two dozen neutral dwarves split into two gangs. A surly, browbeaten lot, they have no interest in who the characters are or what their business at the tomb is. If talked to, they grumble about their poor food and lack of pay, with the two groups blaming each other for every worksite mishap and grievance. They flee into the tomb if threatened, but fight with picks and shovels if cornered.

Each Dwarven Worker uses the cultist stat block with the following changes:

- They are neutral, have a speed of 25 feet, and speak Common and Dwarven.
- They have <wc-fetch type="sense">darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet.
- They have advantage on saving throws against the <wc-fetch type="condition">poisoned</wc-fetch> condition and resistance to poison damage.
- They have a +4 bonus to Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">History</wc-fetch>) checks related to the origin of stonework.
- Their attacks with picks or hammers are treated as a scimitar attack that deals bludgeoning or piercing damage.

#### Umber Hulk Handlers

Three neutral evil dwarf Cult Fanatic wear spiky leather armor and serve as handlers for the pair of umber hulks found in **area area 2**. They know certain command words that magically compel the hulks' obedience. The handlers carry long hooked poles to prod the hulks, and which are also enchanted to magically open and close the stone slab in **area area 2**.

If approached, the handlers refer characters to Moghadam in **area area 1**. If combat breaks out, they flee to **area area 2** and release the umber hulks, ordering them to dispose of the intruders. They step up to fight for themselves only if all else fails.

#### Treasure

Little of value can be found in the camp aside from personal effects. These effects include several letters offering high wages for construction workers, signed by Moghadam.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes a number of the dwarves to erupt into squabbling, allowing the characters to approach any of the tomb entrances without notice.

</wc-gallery>

### 1. Office of the Artificer

> This entrance opens up to a large stone chamber. At the far end, an intense-looking man stands behind a large stone table covered in a dense layer of plans, drawings, and other documents. Tiny wax golems, their heads all lit wicks of flame, flit about the place, keeping the objects under his gaze well illuminated.
> 
> The man raises his head and intones: "So, you've come to engage in this grand endeavor. Are you miners, sculptors, artists? Or, I suspect, something else entirely?"

Moghadam the artificer manages the design and construction of the Tomb of Horrors from this office. He knows he has nothing to fear from the characters, and has little personal loyalty to Acererak. As such, he is happy to listen to any tale the characters tell, and to entertain any deal they might offer.

#### Moghadam's Bargain

Moghadam knows about the _Infernal Machine_ components in the tomb, and is quick to negotiate with the characters for them. In truth, he has no intention of parting with them and looks to subvert any deal, ideally by luring the characters to the evil chapel (**area area 14**).

![Moghadam](adventure/IMR/005-003.png)

The artificer talks of having a number of tasks that the characters can help him with, and says he will trade the components for either of the following:

- The characters must travel to the Temple of Moloch (see chapter 4) to rescue the gemsmith Seodra and any surviving thieves sent there. They must then help those operatives complete their mission to steal the gemstone eyes from the temple's greatest statue.
- The characters can instead travel to the temple to facilitate a prisoner exchange, taking Nolzur and some of the sculptors working the tomb to exchange for the gemsmith.

The distance between the Tomb of Horrors and the Temple of Moloch is left to your determination, as are the details of the overland journey. If you don't want to play out that journey, the characters' mechanical guide can use its teleportation ability to take them to the temple.

If the characters have already been at large within the tomb and caused trouble, Moghadam might decide he's better off being rid of them. In that event, he might offer to trade the components in exchange for the characters meeting with Phenex and assisting in his ceremony (expecting that the priest will dispense with them), or recapturing the balor if the characters' actions have freed it (hoping that the resulting battle finishes the characters off).

If the characters enter into a deal with Moghadam, he writes them a magic pass that allows them to travel the tomb without being attacked by the girallons therein. Moghadam can communicate telepathically with anyone carrying a pass, and can teleport into an unoccupied space next to anyone carrying a pass.

#### Treasure

The stone table here is the first piece of stone cut for the tomb's excavation. It holds a number of important documents of Moghadam's creation, including the master map of the tomb. This map features a notation in Undercommon: "The true master of the tomb is he who plans its construction."

Characters who have a chance to look around this area can also find <wc-fetch type="item">calligrapher's supplies</wc-fetch>; a <wc-fetch type="item">forgery kit</wc-fetch>; <wc-fetch type="item">Spell Scroll</wc-fetch> of <wc-fetch type="spell">arcane lock</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">glyph of warding</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type="spell">legend lore</wc-fetch>; a <wc-fetch type="item">wand of secrets</wc-fetch>; and a strongbox containing 30 pp.

### 2. Umber Hulk Pen

Before its eventual conversion into a false tomb entrance, this tunnel is being used to house a mated pair of umber hulks used as labor for the tomb's construction. During the day, they carve out tunnels for the tomb. At night and while their handlers take breaks, they are kept behind a 10-foot-thick stone block that is magically slid across the tunnel.

#### Creatures

The two Umber Hulk have symbols magically scribed on their mandibles by Moghadam, placing them under the effect of a permanent <wc-fetch type="spell">dominate monster</wc-fetch> spell. Their handlers (at area B when the characters first arrive) know the command words that compel the hulks into service.

Unless ordered otherwise, the umber hulks stay in this area, defending themselves if necessary. If the characters are at the tomb site long enough, they might witness the umber hulks carving out new areas of the dungeon in the blank part of the map.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the umber hulks to either return here to rest if they are elsewhere, or to depart for the tomb to begin work, opening or closing the stone slab accordingly.

### 3. Entrance to the Tomb

> This broad tunnel is currently being shaped into the tomb's elaborate entryway. This is an active site, featuring a number of artisans working by lantern light to plaster the walls and paint them with bright, colorful murals. Other artisans are covering the floor in an elaborate mosaic featuring a distinct winding path of red tiles, some of which cross over a series of open pits.

This area is noisy with the sounds of hammering and stone cutting coming from the west (areas 8 and 10). If the umber hulks are digging, a rumbling can also be heard to the east. But even over all that, the characters can hear a rhythmic chanting coming from the south (carried from the chapel of **area area 14** by the magic of Phenex's ceremony).

#### Creatures

Twelve neutral Tiefling Muralist work here, constantly mixing fresh pigments to be applied to the plaster walls. A muralist uses the cultist stat block with the following changes:

- It knows the <wc-fetch type="spell">thaumaturgy</wc-fetch> cantrip.
- It has resistance to fire damage.
- It has <wc-fetch type="sense">darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet.
- It speaks Common and Infernal.

A successful DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check made by any character looking over the pigments being prepared identifies the ingredients as including impossibly bright-red blood. If questioned, the muralists talk of working in the tomb in the service of its art, which transcends all other concerns. They direct the characters either to Moghadam or onward to Phenex in response to any other questions.

#### Murals

If the murals are examined, read the following (from the original Tomb of Horrors):

> The scenes painted show fields with kine grazing, a copse with several wolves in the background, slaves (human, orc, elf, and strange human-animal mixture: pig-human, ape-human, and dog-human) going about various tasks. Certain of the frescoes show the rooms of some building: a library filled with many books and scrolls, a torture chamber, a wizard's workroom. Chairs, windows, boxes, bales, doors, chests, birds, bats, spiders, and all manner of things are shown on the walls.

#### Looking South

The muralists' lantern light illuminates the north half of this area. The details of **area area 6** are visible only when characters with <wc-fetch type="sense">darkvision</wc-fetch> or a light source move close enough to the end of the hall.

#### Open Pits

In several places, the winding mosaic path crosses over a series of open pits yet to be covered and concealed. The first four pits are each 10 feet deep and empty except for refuse.

The pit leading to **area area 7** is 30 feet deep and contains a ladder. Characters who watch this area long enough see the muralists periodically climb down into this pit, then later return with vials of bright-red blood (claimed from Nolzur in **area area 7**) to be mixed into new pigments.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes one of the muralists to descend the southernmost pit to collect more blood from Nolzur (held in **area area 7**). If Nolzur has been rescued, the muralists report this to Moghadam, who rallies available workers to hunt for the missing thief.

### 4. Side Entrance

This section of the wall has not yet been plastered or painted over, leaving an open doorway leading west. The pit before the doorway is crossed by a series of wooden planks.

### 5. Control Room

> Through a stone archway, several banks of panels and instruments can be seen lining the walls. They crackle with sparks of eldritch energy, their dials and controls moving of their own volition.

Commissioned by Acererak, the wizard Tuerny built these controls for the balor's prison in area 6. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check identifies a number of silver wires that lead from these controls into area 6 and are attached to the imprisoned balor.

Anyone attempting to disrupt the controls or the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) force damage. The controls and the wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed. However, if the ceremony is disrupted, the controls here can be set to free the balor.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area drains more energy from the balor, causing him to fall <wc-fetch type="condition">unconscious</wc-fetch> in area 6.

> ##### Who's Who
> 
> The wizard Tuerny was the creator of the long-lost artifact called the _Iron Flask of Tuerny the Merciless_, used to trap demons, devils, and other creatures. This artifact later became the model for the lesser-but-still-legendary magic of the iron flask. According to lore, Tuerny became a nalfeshnee demon before vanishing from history.

### 6. Captive Balor

> At the end of this hall, some sort of horrible binding process is underway. A balor is held against the wall, pressed in against the stonework design of a great green devil's face. A black sphere holds the demon in place, and appears to be slowly draining away its essence.

The balor Tarnhem is bound here by the magic of Acererak, who has fashioned a device from a <wc-fetch type="item">sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch> that slowly drains away Tarnhem's essence to fuel the magical workings of the tomb.

A successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check identifies a number of silver wires attached to the Balor and running to the control room (**area area 5**). Anyone attempting to disrupt the controls or the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) force damage. The controls and the wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.

#### Bargaining with Tarnhem

If the characters are free to speak with Tarnhem, the balor asks them to disrupt the ceremony in the chapel (**area area 14**), and then set the controls in **area area 5** to release him. To convince them to do so, the fiend promises anything within his power. As a show of good faith, he can relate how to safely open the treasure chests in **area area 13**, and how his weapons have been taken to the chapel (**area area 14**) and worked into the altar there.

Tarnhem uses the balor stat block with the following changes:

- While held, Tarnhem is <wc-fetch type="condition">incapacitated</wc-fetch> but can still speak.
- Until he recovers his weapons from the chapel, his Longsword and Whip actions are replaced by the following action option: _**Fist of Retribution**._ _Melee Weapon Attack_: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit_: 13 (<wc-roll>2d4 + 8</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) fire damage.

If released, Tarnhem upholds any agreement he made to not harm the characters. He instead focuses his wrath on Moghadam and Phenex, hunting both down before vanishing into the rift to the Lower Planes in **area area 16**.

If the balor is released, the sphere binding him becomes a <wc-fetch type="item">sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch> and is unmoored. It travels throughout the tomb at random, though is confined by the tomb's magic to stay within its rooms and corridors rather than boring through the walls. This sphere can be controlled as normal while within the tomb, but it cannot leave.

If Tarnhem is not freed, the balor is eventually drained away to become part of a horrible monument. His life force fuels the black sphere in the mouth of the great green devil face in this area when the Tomb of Horrors is complete.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area reverts Tarnhem to an earlier period before so much of his life force was drained, awakening him if he is <wc-fetch type="condition">unconscious</wc-fetch>.

### 7. Forsaken Prison

A narrow crawl space leads here from the southernmost pit in the entrance hall (**area area 3**). At the bottom of a 10-foot drop at the end of the crawl space, a miserable cell holds a solitary prisoner. The artisan Nolzur (a neutral male human master thief, but he is reduced to 1 hit point) has been captured and held here, his alchemical blood continually drained to create the magic pigments used to paint the tomb's murals. The muralists drain him with tools crafted from the beaks of stirges, keeping him barely alive with healing magic.

Nolzur is too weak to escape on his own, but if rescued and provided healing and nourishment, he gladly aids the characters in any way. This includes telling the characters the general layout of the Temple of Moloch, and revealing Thessalar's vulnerability to magic potions and salves that restore hit points (see "**area Who Dwells Here?**" in chapter 4).

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes one of the muralists to arrive here to collect more blood, for use in either **area area 3** or 10. Spending 2 charges also restores a measure of health to Nolzur, equivalent to the effect of a <wc-fetch type="spell">cure wounds</wc-fetch> spell.

### 8. Sculptors' Workroom

This workspace is used by a number of neutral human sculptors creating objects for use in the tomb. Five are present when the characters first enter this area, watched over and assisted by a girallon. The sculptors (use the cultist stat block) traveled here from the Temple of Moloch under the false promise of fabulous payment for helping construct the tomb. They have since found themselves unable to leave.

The sculptors seek assistance to escape the tomb, and provide whatever information they know in exchange for aid. They can relate how the rest of the sculptors (in **area area 10**) are devising a means of escape using a set of superior <wc-fetch type="item">mason's tools</wc-fetch> hidden there, and that these tools can also weaken the eidolon in the Temple of Moloch (see **area area 25** in chapter 4). They also know that the muralists are loyal to Moghadam and cannot be trusted.

The rhythmic chanting magically carried into **area area 3** grows louder in this area.

> #### Nolzur's Gift
> 
> If the characters help him escape from the Tomb of Horrors, Nolzur later sends them a set of his <wc-fetch type="item">Nolzur's marvelous pigments</wc-fetch>, which magically arrives wherever and whenever they end up after the adventure is done. The delivery also contains a small, unpainted miniature figure representing each character. Each figure is a tiny clockwork device. If painted and kept on hand, the figures secretly animate to help the characters with small tasks whenever they sleep.

#### Creatures

Under the command of Phenex (**area area 14**), the girallon has been ordered to obey the sculptors as they work, but to not allow them to leave the tomb. The creature carries torches in two hands to provide light for the sculptors. With the other two, it hands out hammers, chisels, and other tools as needed.

The girallon challenges the characters unless they bear one of Moghadam's magical passes. In combat, it uses the implements it holds as weapons. Use the statistics for the girallon's claw attack, but a hammer attack deals bludgeoning damage and a chisel attack deals piercing damage. A torch attack deals bludgeoning damage plus 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) fire damage.

#### Treasure

The girallon wears a golden armband (worth 250 gp) on one of its left arms, scribed by Moghadam with magical symbols that place the creature under the effect of a permanent <wc-fetch type="spell">dominate monster</wc-fetch> spell. Phenex (**area area 14**) knows the command words that compel the girallon into service.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the girallon to leave. Roll a <wc-roll>d4</wc-roll>. On a 1–2, the girallon checks in with Moghadam in **area area 1**. On a 3–4, it goes to see Phenex in **area area 14**.

### 9. Artisans' Chambers

This connected series of rooms are currently being used as small apartments and storerooms for the muralists and sculptors laboring inside the tomb. The rooms are small, sparse, and minimally furnished.

The rhythmic chanting magically carried into **area area 3** grows louder in this area.

#### Treasure

These areas contain only personal effects, including several invitations sent from Moghadam for employment at the tomb and offering exorbitant wages. As well, one of the artisans has a map showing the overland route from the Temple of Moloch to the Tomb of Horrors.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes <wc-roll>1d4 + 1</wc-roll> artisans to either return here from their labors, or depart for their work.

## Exploring the Tomb (areas 10-18)

### 10. Great Hall of Spheres

> This area is being crafted into a second grand hall. Like the entrance hall, it is a busy and noisy work site. A number of artisans are plastering the walls and painting them with bright, colorful murals that include large spheres of different colors. Other artisans work at stone cutting. Watching over them all is a massive four-armed girallon, helping to light the area by holding torches in each of its hands.

#### Creatures

Five neutral human sculptors (use the cultist stat block) originally from the Temple of Moloch are here creating stonework for the tomb. Desperate to escape, they are working on a secret plan.

Eight neutral tiefling muralists are plastering and painting, as well as covering the floor with inlaid tiles. They use the same statistics and respond to questions in the same way as the muralists in **area area 3**.

The girallon is under orders to obey the workers but not to allow them to leave the tomb. It challenges the characters unless they bear one of Moghadam's magical passes, using the torches as weapons. Use the statistics for the girallon's claw attack, but a torch attack deals bludgeoning damage plus 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) fire damage.

#### Murals

If the murals are examined, read the following (from the original Tomb of Horrors):

> The walls are being painted with figures of animals, strange signs and glyphs, and humanoids posing with spheres of different colors.

##### Golden Sphere

Only one of the spheres has special significance: a golden sphere located in the northwest corner that covers the entrance to area 11. The entrance can be noticed behind the sphere, whose magic does not yet fully conceal it. However, that magic prevents anyone carrying any gold or wearing any clothing that is gold in color from passing through the sphere.

##### Open Passageway

One section of the east wall has not yet been plastered or painted over, revealing the passageway to the chapel (**area area 14**). The rhythmic chanting magically carried into **area area 3** grows louder still at the entrance to the passageway. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check identifies the chanting as belonging to some sort of ritual involving enchantment magic.

#### Treasure

The girallon wears a golden armband (worth 250 gp) on one of its left arms, scribed by Moghadam with magical symbols that place the creature under the effect of a permanent <wc-fetch type="spell">dominate monster</wc-fetch> spell. Phenex (**area area 14**) knows the command words that compel the girallon into service.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the girallon to leave. Roll a <wc-roll>d4</wc-roll>. On a 1–2, the girallon checks in with Moghadam in **area area 1**. On a 3–4, it goes to see Phenex in **area area 14**.

### 11. Escape Room

The sculptors have utilized this side chamber to plan their escape, though none of them are present when the characters first come here.

The room is occupied by a life-sized sculpture of a winged girallon. Once it is finished, the sculptors plan to animate the statue using the information from half a <wc-fetch type="item">manual of stone golems</wc-fetch> in their possession. The manual was torn in half and taken from the Temple of Moloch, where the other half still resides. If brought to life, the statue uses the stone golem stat block, and the sculptors use it to attack the tomb's girallon guards and flee.

If the characters earn the trust of the sculptors, the sculptors estimate completing the statue will take three days. They ask the characters to help buy them this time.

#### Treasure

The partial <wc-fetch type="item">manual of stone golems</wc-fetch> is hidden beneath a pile of rocks in the corner of the room, and can be found with any search of the area. Even incomplete, it is worth 500 gp.

Additionally, the sculptors store a set of superior <wc-fetch type="item">mason's tools</wc-fetch> here. These tools grant advantage when used to make an appropriate crafting check, and are worth 500 gp.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area either brings the statue one day of work closer or further from completion (a 50 percent chance for either).

### 12. False Doors

To gain time to complete their statue in area 11, the sculptors spend much of their time building, destroying, and rebuilding a number of false doors here in the great hall. Two such doors are marked at area 12 on the map.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area creates or removes a false door at random.

### 13. Chamber of Three Chests

This treasury holds resources for the construction of the tomb, including precious metals and gemstones stored here for safekeeping. A number of bones from former prisoners and creatures lie heaped about these materials, acting as magical guardians for three chests—one made of gold, one made of silver, and one made of oak.

The three locked chests can be opened with a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. However, doing so triggers this area's protective magic.

#### Creatures

Opening the gold chest causes the bones in the room to assemble into a giant skeleton. Opening the silver chest results in the bones becoming a skeletal juggernaut. Opening the oak chest creates a skeletal swarm from the bones. If more than one chest is opened, these monsters each assemble in turn, with the next appearing when the previous threat is destroyed. However, if all three chests are opened simultaneously, the bones remain inanimate.

#### Treasure

Panels meant for the tomb's walls are stored here. Each panel is approximately 2 feet wide and 3 feet long, weighs 20 pounds, and is crafted from various materials of differing value:

- Twenty gleaming copper panels (worth 25 gp each)
- Twenty silver panels (50 gp each)
- Ten panels of rare woods inlaid with ivory (150 gp each)
- Five panels of ivory with gold inlaid (500 gp each)

The three chests hold the following:

- The gold chest has four <wc-fetch type="item">Potion of Greater Healing</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of flying</wc-fetch>, and a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of poison</wc-fetch>.
- The silver chest contains <wc-fetch type="item">Spell Scroll</wc-fetch> of <wc-fetch type="spell">guards and wards</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">summon lesser demons</wc-fetch> (see appendix C), and <wc-fetch type="spell">teleportation circle</wc-fetch>; and a <wc-fetch type="item">wand of web</wc-fetch>.
- The oak chest holds 278 pp, ninety-seven small gems (worth 10 gp each), and a peridot (5,000 gp).

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes any currently active animated skeletal creature to grow weaker or stronger. Roll a <wc-roll>d4</wc-roll>. On a 1–2, the creature halves its hit points. On a 3–4, the creature doubles its hit points.

### 14. Chapel of Evil

> The chanting heard throughout the tomb originates in this chapel, whose pews are filled with more than two dozen worshipers—and, oddly, with two large chunks of rough black stone. The chapel appears dedicated to Vecna, decorated with artwork and symbols in honor of the god of evil secrets. The worshipers, all humanoid, appear exhausted as they continue their chant. As you watch, one of them collapses—and is suddenly and horrifyingly <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch> into another chunk of black stone.
> 
> At the far end of the chapel, a handsome priest stands behind an altar block that glows an opalescent blue. The priest is missing his left eye and hand, but has a second set of arms grafted to his body. All three of his arms gesture as if directing the worshipers like a conductor. Two girallons flank him, each of them also missing an eye and hand.
> 
> The priest smiles and gestures for you to enter the chapel and take a seat. And the chanting fills your mind with a desire to obey...

#### Creatures

The roughly thirty humanoids here (use the cultist stat block) include loyal cultists pressed into service, workers being punished, and captured prisoners. None of the worshipers (except Pentival; see below) can take any actions beyond continuing to chant as long as the priest, Phenex, commands them.

##### Pentival

One of the prisoners includes the lawful good half-dragon paladin Pentival. Drawn to the temple by rumors of its bound balor, Pentival and his party were quickly captured. All his friends have succumbed to the magic of the temple and been transformed into black rock, but Pentival has so far held out. Of all the worshipers, he alone can communicate with the characters, quickly explaining who he is and the nature of the ceremony.

If freed, Pentival joins the characters for the remainder of their time at the tomb. He uses the half-red dragon veteran stat block, but has the form of a gold dragon. However, he insists on keeping Tarnhem imprisoned, and on attempting to destroy Moghadam.

##### Phenex

An incubus cleric of Vecna, Phenex directs the dark ceremony here. As long as he commands the worshipers (using a bonus action each round), they maintain their chant.

In combat, Phenex first orders the girallons to attack. As needed, he then uses his Charm action to force a character or Pentival to defend him. Due to his fanatic devotion, Phenex does not use his Etherealness action to escape a fight, but remains in the chapel to the bitter end.

##### Girallons

The two girallons that protect Phenex have each had a left hand and eye removed. They use the girallon stat block but can make only three claw attacks as part of their multiattack action.

#### Ceremony

As long as the worshipers chant, the ceremony fueling the balor's prison (**area area 6**) remains active. They continue to chant while they are physically able and while Phenex commands them. The ceremony fuels Phenex as well, allowing him to maintain it without need for sustenance or sleep.

Anyone entering the chapel while the ceremony is underway must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall under an effect equivalent to a <wc-fetch type="spell">mass suggestion</wc-fetch> spell. While a character is under this effect, Phenex can direct them to sit and join the ceremony. Any character who does so takes up the chant, and has their Constitution score reduced by 1 each round on initiative count 0. A character reduced to 0 hit points while under this effect dies and has their body and all possessions transformed into a chunk of black rock (see below). A character under the effect of the ceremony can make another saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the effect with a success.

(This version of the ceremony is more potent than that suffered by the other worshipers, who would otherwise have all turned to black rock by now. Phenex is concentrating his magic in an effort to defeat the characters.)

If Phenex is defeated, any remaining worshipers immediately cease chanting and collapse into exhausted unconsciousness. Once a character is freed from the ceremony and out of combat, their hit point maximum is restored at a rate of 1 hit point per round. Anyone transformed into a black rock unfortunately remains in this condition.

#### Black Rocks

When a worshiper's life energy has been drained by the ceremony, they are transformed into a large black rock, carried out of the tomb, and set on the hillside (where they'll eventually form the image of a grinning skull). A <wc-fetch type="spell">greater restoration</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="spell">wish</wc-fetch> spell can end the <wc-fetch type="condition">petrified</wc-fetch> condition for one victim, restoring them and their gear.

#### Altar

This block of strange material glows with an inner light of opalescent blue, owing to the missing components of the _Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad_ wired into its workings. There are three such components, each a deep sapphire blue. Removing one component safely requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, jeweler's tools, or tinker's tools.

In addition, Tarnhem's flaming whip and lightning-imbued longsword have also been worked into the altar. On a failed check to remove a missing component, these weapons cast a <wc-fetch type="spell">lightning bolt</wc-fetch> or a <wc-fetch type="spell">fireball</wc-fetch> at the character making the check (a 50 percent chance for either spell; save DC 16 for both). If Tarnhem is freed, he comes here directly to recover these weapons, and is the only creature that can do so. Anyone else attempting to claim them automatically triggers a <wc-fetch type="spell">lightning bolt</wc-fetch> or a <wc-fetch type="spell">fireball</wc-fetch>.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area reverts one of the black rocks back to a living worshiper.

### 15. Secret Door

A secret door here leads to a hallway beyond. The door is unlocked and can be found with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check.

### 16. Rift to the Lower Planes

The ceremony that summoned Tarnhem resulted in an unstable rift to the Lower Planes opening up in this area. The far end of the hallway is scribed with glyphs and sigils, and leads to an open fiery pit—a portal to the Abyss. The unstable magic of the portal prevents any creature that is not a fiend from stepping through it. If Tarnhem is freed, he eventually comes this way and escapes.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes a ripple in the rift's magic, allowing a creature to pass through it into the tomb. Roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll>. On a 1–5, treat this effect as a <wc-fetch type="spell">summon lesser demons</wc-fetch> spell. On a 5–6, treat it as a <wc-fetch type="spell">summon greater demon</wc-fetch> spell. (See appendix C for both those spells.) Pick one character at random to be treated as the summoner.

### 17. Flooding Pit

The corridor beyond the secret door at **area area 15** contains three open 10-foot-deep pits. Lying at the bottom of each pit, a number of skeletons are shackled to the walls. In addition, the outline of a door on the south wall of each pit can be seen.

![undefined](adventure/IMR/006-004.png)

#### Flooding Trap

The first two pits are trapped, such that anyone trying the false door at the bottom causes a stone slab to slide across the opening, the skeletons to animate (see below), and the pit to begin filling with water. It takes 5 rounds to completely fill a pit, leaving no air space at the top. After one hour, the slab opens and the water drains away.

A successful DC 20 Strength check allows a character inside or outside the pit to pry the slab open, allowing escape from the pit. A character proficient with mason's tools can also make a DC 18 Dexterity check using those tools, cracking open the slab on a success.

#### Creatures

The first pit contains four humanoid Skeleton. The second contains two umber hulk exoskeletons (use the minotaur skeleton stat block, but treat its greataxe attack as a claws attack and its gore attack as a mandibles attack). The third looks like it contains the skeleton of a large wolf-headed humanoid, but a successful DC 13 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check reveals that the creature is a mix of humanoid and animal bones. The bones do not animate.

When either of the first two pits are sealed, the skeletons within animate. They remain shackled to the walls, but attack any character in the pit to hinder any attempt to escape from the flooding chamber.

#### True Doorway

The third pit contains an actual door leading to area 18.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area opens one closed pit at random, or closes one pit at random if all the pits are open.

### 18. Guardian Door

> A mithral door in the stone wall resembles the figure of a flattened tortle, its arms and legs extended to the four corners, and its shell carved with a complete map of the tomb. Its head is turned in profile, its eye set with a gleaming gem.

When any character approaches the door, the tortle's head animates and intones: "Are you the master?"

#### Opening Riddle

The door unlocks automatically for Moghadam or Seodra the gemsmith. To anyone else, it repeatedly asks, "Who is the master?" The correct answer to the question can be found in Moghadam's office (**area area 1**): "The true master of the tomb is he who plans its construction." With any answer other than that phrase or the name "Moghadam," the door replies that the speaker is not the master and refuses to open.

#### Soul Gem

The door's eye is gem set with a smaller version of one of a demilich's soul gems. The gem can be removed only by a character proficient with jeweler's tools who succeeds on a DC 13 Dexterity check using the superior jeweler's tools found in **area area 31** of chapter 4. A successful check removes the soul gem, which destroys the gem and unlocks the door.

A character who attempts to remove or destroy the gem in any other way must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) force damage.

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the door to intone: "The master does not resort to feeble manipulations of a clock to open this door. You are not the master."

### 18a. Gemsmith's Workshop

Seodra, a master gemsmith in the employ of Moghadam, maintains her workshop here, although she is currently a prisoner in the Temple of Moloch (see chapter 4).

> Beyond the door, a series of overlapping curtains embroidered with a pattern of silvery spiderwebs drape across a stairway leading down.

#### Curtains

The first three curtains are sheets of thick webbing that function as the product of the <wc-fetch type="spell">web</wc-fetch> spell. The fourth is a disguised trapper kept by Seodra as a pet, and which attacks anyone who passes by it except Seodra and Moghadam.

Once the characters move beyond the curtains, read:

> This workshop features a number of tables covered in <wc-fetch type="item">jeweler's tools</wc-fetch> and materials—including three large diamonds. Set against the back wall is a couch upholstered in golden cloth, on which rests a headless body outfitted in elaborate robes.

When the first character descends the stairs, the body rises to its feet.

#### Creature

The body is a greater zombie, used by Seodra as a manikin and animated assistant. It automatically stands up whenever anyone enters the workshop, but does not attack unless Seodra's gems are touched (see below).

#### Treasure

In addition to a set of <wc-fetch type="item">jeweler's tools</wc-fetch>, one worktable contains plans for crafting the jeweled silver skull of a demilich. The three large diamonds (worth 1,000 gp each) have already been cut and fashioned into teeth. These are meant for the skull currently in Seodra's possession (see chapter 4).

#### Manipulating Time

Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the manikin to approach the table and indefinitely pantomime searching for its missing head. Spending 2 charges causes it to search briefly, then settle back down to the couch, where it remains inert until anyone new enters the workshop.

> ##### Completing the Skull
> 
> If Seodra has all six diamond teeth (the three in the Tomb of Horrors, along with the three she has with her in **area area 31** of chapter 4), the jeweled eyes from the great statue in the Temple of Moloch (**area area 25** of chapter 4), and the silver skull (also in **area area 31** of chapter 4), she will have all she needs to complete Acererak's demilich skull.
> 
> The magic of the ritual that creates the skull shrinks down the great rubies of Moloch's eyes to fit the silver skull. The last stage of the ritual involves placing the finished skull atop the manikin in area 18a. The spirit of the archmage Acererak then possesses the manikin and transforms it into an eye of fear and flame. If the characters are present, they can treat with Acererak in this form.
> 
> The eye of fear and flame attacks at once if the characters are known to have undertaken any actions against Moghadam, the tomb, or its workers. If not, and if Acererak is impressed with their adventuring acumen, the archmage promises to grant a great boon in exchange for some measure of service necessary for the completion of his tomb. The details of the service are left to your determination. The boon can be the equivalent of a wish spell, though whether or not Acererak fulfills any promise is left to you to decide.
