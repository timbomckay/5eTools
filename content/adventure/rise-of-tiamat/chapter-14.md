When the Cult of the Dragon sounded the <wc-fetch type="item">Draakhorn</wc-fetch>, its tremors were felt across the North. In response, many metallic dragons began to investigate what the sounding meant, and to gather what information they could on the cult from nearby humanoid cultures.

One of those dragons, an ancient gold wyrm named Protanther, invoked an ancient draconic rite of council, summoning ambassadors from among the metallic dragons. Meeting in the Nether Mountains, the council will determine what metallic dragons should do in the face of the looming threat of Tiamat.

The council includes representatives from each of the five metallic dragon races, who will spread word to their fellows of the council's decision. Of specific importance to the factions of Waterdeep is the question of whether the dragons should aid the civilized humanoid races in their fight against the cult, or whether they will act on their own.

During the council, the adventurers have a chance to engage and debate some of Faerûn's wisest and most powerful creatures. They must convince the dragons that the cause of the humanoid folk of the Sword Coast is just, and that dragons and non-dragons need to support each other in this conflict.

To broker such an alliance, the characters might need to promise concessions on behalf of different factions—whether they have those factions' permission to offer concessions or not. If they are successful, the adventurers can gain not only the support of the dragons as a whole but also the specific favor of certain councilors, including valuable magic items from those dragons' own hoards.

## Unlikely Ambassadors

By ancient tradition, the draconic council includes ambassadors from the diminutive humanoid races. The silver dragon Otaaryliakkarnos—in the guise of the human Elia—comes to the Council of Waterdeep to extend the invitation to the draconic council, at which point, the delegates discuss who should be sent as ambassadors for the humanoid factions of the Sword Coast. As a group not aligned overall with any specific faction or cause, the party is deemed to be the best fit.

### Journey to the Nether Mountains

The journey from Waterdeep to the Nether Mountains is more than six hundred miles. Otaaryliakkarnos is willing to grant the characters the special boon of flying them there on her back in only two days. However, this offer is extended only if the adventurers leave directly from the council, rather than first pursuing any other business.

The journey takes the characters through areas suffering under the cult's attacks. Whether from horseback or by air, they see the ruins of isolated settlements and smoke hanging on the horizon. If the characters travel overland, they might pass through some of these ruined settlements, or encounter cult marauders, brigands, refugees, and chromatic dragons bent on destruction. Use your own discretion when choosing how many combat encounters the journey should encompass.

## Council of Dragons

Five ancient dragons make up the council charged with deciding their metallic kin's response to the cult. Though they are not necessarily the wisest or most powerful specimens of dragonkind, all are well respected. Any decision made by these dragon councilors will be accepted by the metallic dragons as a whole.

The dragons have no need to judge the different factions of the Sword Coast, for they know of their reputations and actions already. The dragons' attitudes are effectively fixed in that regard. However, they know also that among all the humanoid races, leaders often determine the character of societies. Though they understand that the adventurers are not the nominal leaders of any faction, the dragons already know that the heroes' actions have set the course of the factions' battle against Tiamat. As such, if the dragons side with the humanoids, it will be as a statement of personal faith in the party—and in the party's ability to bring all the factions into the fight.

### Attitudes

Each dragon councilor has one of four attitudes in this chapter, ranging from **unfriendly** to **cautious**, **neutral**, and **friendly**. To secure the cooperation of the metallic dragons as a whole, the party must conclude this chapter with at least three dragon councilors having a friendly attitude and with none unfriendly. If the characters make a promise or perform an act aimed at a specific dragon, they gain a two-step improvement in the attitude of that dragon (for example, from unfriendly to neutral, or from cautious to friendly). A general concession grants a one-step improvement to a single dragon of your choosing.

Metallic dragons are exceedingly wise, but they sometimes have difficulty distinguishing individual humanoids from each other. As such, an individual dragon's initial attitude depends on the party's racial makeup—and on ancient interactions and past wrongs.

See "Chapter 9:Council of Waterdeep" for information on the effects of the concessions offered by the adventurers to secure the metallic dragons' allegiance.

### Protanther

_Male Gold Dragon_

Protanther is the leader of the council. A former King of Justice—a royal title among the gold dragons—he does not care for humanoids, particularly humans and elves. Though he sees both good and bad in the lesser races, he believes that their capacity for attaining great power despite their physical limitations makes them dangerous. For all their capability, humanoids have little time to learn the wisdom to direct that capability.

The gold dragon knows that many of the world's most blighted creatures descend from humans who bargained with dark forces for power, including yuan-ti and tieflings. He considers the cycle of failed human civilizations across Faerûn as a sign of a quintessential flaw in human nature. Moreover, he is quick to point out that humans make up the majority of evil archmages and liches—including Sammaster, who founded the Cult of the Dragon, and Szass Tam's Red Wizards. Even the current leader of the Cult of the Dragon, Severin, and a majority of the cult's members are human.

Protanther can at least appreciate that the crimes of the humanoid races are usually directed against each other. He knows that the short lives of many humanoids means they might not even recognize their own evil. The elves, however, live for long years and possess great knowledge—and have used that knowledge to the detriment of dragonkind in the past. It was the elves who shaped the magic of the _Dracorage mythal_, causing dragons across Faerûn to go mad with rage. Convincing Protanther to trust humanoid factions that include elves is a difficult task.

##### Desire

Protanther would prefer that the dragons rally their forces with no regard for the humanoid factions, striking immediately and decisively before the cult and its chromatic dragon allies can muster their full strength. If this puts the humanoids at risk, so be it.

##### Attitude

Neutral. If there are humans or tieflings in the party, Protanther is instead cautious. If there are elves in the party, he is unfriendly.

##### Concession

Protanther wants a formal apology from one who speaks for elvenkind for the abomination that was the _Dracorage mythal_. He is willing to trust that the adventurers can wring such an apology from King Melandrach on the council.

### Ileuthra

_Male Brass Dragon_

Ileuthra is an ancient brass dragon who travels the planes in search of knowledge and ever more challenging games. Legend has it that he resides with Oghma, god of knowledge, but the dragon is cagey on that point.

Seeing good and bad in equal measure among the lesser races, Ileuthra recognizes that helping the humanoids is less a case of deciding whether they are worthy of aid, and more about deciding whether these adventurer ambassadors can be trusted to properly lead the factions.

##### Desire

Ileuthra has no preconceived sense of what might be the best course, and he is willing to hear all sides of the discussion.

##### Attitude

Neutral. Ileuthra has watched the lesser races for long centuries from the planes, and he understands that every individual humanoid possesses the potential for good or evil in equal measure. He is truly undecided, and will weigh all options for action against the cult.

##### Concession

Ileuthra believes that the dragon masks are too dangerous to remain in the worldin the world if the humanoid races are aware of where they are. If the characters agree that all dragon masks will be handed over to the metallic dragons as soon as they are found—including any masks captured after the final battle—his attitude can be improved.

### Otaaryliakkarnos

_Female Silver Dragon_

The representative of the silver dragons believes that among the lesser races, neither good nor bad is ever absolute. The humanoids are in need of protection and guidance, and should be shown Bahamut's righteous way of living rather than ignored and treated as children. If the dragons refuse to engage the humanoids and focus only on their own advancement, the humanoids will persist in making the same mistakes again and again.

Otaaryliakkarnos's faith in the potential of humanoids has something of a blind spot when it comes to dwarves, however. She resents the dwarves for their Dragonmoots of old—great hunts during which clans would come together to end the perceived threat of a particular dragon. Centuries before, Otaaryliakkarnos's niece was killed in a Dragonmoot, and with the long ancestral memory of the metallic dragons, she holds all dwarves responsible.

##### Attitude

Neutral. If the party includes one or more dwarves, Otaaryliakkarnos is instead unfriendly.

##### Desire

Otaaryliakkarnos would like the metallic dragons to strike now as Protanther suggests, but she does not know if they can succeed alone. An alliance would reduce casualties for all parties, but the dragons must be certain of the intentions of the factions and their leaders.

##### Concession

Otaaryliakkarnos knows that the skin of her slain kin was used to make armor for the dwarf lord who slew her. She demands the remains be returned and that Ambassador Brawnanvil make an apology on behalf of all dwarves for the wrongful deaths the Dragonmoots have caused.

### Nymmurh

_Male Bronze Dragon_

Of all the dragons on the council, Nymmurh disagrees most strongly with Protanther. He knows that the metallic dragons are made in the image of Bahamut, and have no choice in the matter of being good or evil. Thus, how much greater and more precious is good when it is freely chosen by the humanoids, who must consciously turn away from villainy?

Nymmurh's belief in the potential of humanoids is partly driven by his affection for and protection of the noble Silmerhelve human family in Waterdeep (including Dala Silmerhelve; see "Chapter 9:Council of Waterdeep").

##### Desire

Nymmurh would like to help the factions, looking to the Harpers and the Order of the Gauntlet as epitomizing the best traits of humanoid aspiration.

##### Attitude

Unless the party has engaged in problematic behavior in his presence (or where he would hear of it), Nymmurh is friendly. He knows that the characters come to the council on the recommendation of those he respects and loves.

##### Concession

Nymmurh needs no concession unless the characters have somehow offended him. In such a scenario, the adventurers must prove their worth and goodness in a way you deem suitable.

### Tazmikella

_Female Copper Dragon_

Tazmikella is fond of humans and has spent a great deal of time living among them, but she has reservations about supporting the factions. Her lair and hoard have been the target of cunning thieves and fast-talking swindlers more than once, and she perceives betrayal as a humanoid trait. She fears what might happen if one or more factions turn against the metallic dragons to demonstrate loyalty to Tiamat.

The copper dragon also believes that unrestricted interaction between humanoids and dragons has been disastrous for both races. The _Dracorage mythal_ serves as a sore reminder of the animosity that has often arisen between the two peoples.

##### Desire

Tazmikella agrees with Protanther that the metallic dragons could strike against the chromatic dragons themselves. However, she is not convinced they would succeed, and having humanoid allies would reduce casualties for both sides.

##### Attitude

Neutral. If any character is a dragonborn, Tazmikella is instead cautious. If the party contains any character with a personal reputation for shady dealings (particularly a rogue or bard), she is unfriendly.

##### Concession

Pick one magic item owned by a member of the party, and which was found during a previous adventure. That item turns out to have once belonged to Tazmikella, and was part of a hoard she took from an ancient black dragon she defeated. (<wc-fetch type="spell">Legend lore</wc-fetch> or similar magic used on the item confirms this story.) The item holds sentimental value to her—or it did until a thief stole it from her hoard. Returning the item to her with an apology improves Tazmikella's attitude.

> ###### A Relic for Just Such an Occasion
> 
> Metallic dragons are known to bestow magic and treasure from their hoards to help heroes from time to time. If the characters do an excellent job impressing the dragons—for example, bringing all five dragons up to an attitude of friendly—or if they roleplayed the encounter well, the council dragons might grant one or more characters with a token of their esteem. This is likely a set of 3 <wc-fetch type="item">Arrow of Slaying</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type="item">Armor of Resistance</wc-fetch>. Either will prove useful against the cult, especially if the characters have yet to play through chapter 15. Tazmikella can even return the item the characters gave to her as a concession. (She does not covet it when it might do others good, but simply resents having had it stolen.)

### General Concessions

The party can make general concessions to the dragons to appease them as a group, rather than make personal concessions to individual dragons. A general concession improves the attitude of a single dragon of your choice by one step.

#### Wealth

Even good dragons love treasure, and bestowing a share of the hoard the cult has collected for Tiamat goes a long way toward improving the attitudes of the council dragons. The party can effectively treat the dragons as another faction receiving an equal portion of the hoard, granting one share of the total treasure divided among eleven factions. Doing so improves the attitude of a single dragon by one step. For every additional share the dragons are promised (two shares among twelve factions, three shares among thirteen factions, and so on), the party improves the attitude of another dragon by one step.

The attitude of the dragons is improved by wealth in the following order: Tazmikella, Otaaryliakkarnos, Ileuthra, Protanther, and Nymmurh. Promising one-third (five shares among fifteen factions) or more of the treasure improves the attitude of all five dragons.

#### Other Promises

The dragons do not prompt the party with options, but the characters can potentially sway them with other offers. Reward player ingenuity for options such as the following:

- Promise to turn over Severin as a prisoner if captured, or to deliver his body to the dragons if slain
- Consecrating a major monastery or temple to Bahamut
- Dedicating a historical plot of land as belonging to the dragons

## Conclusion

When the characters have reached a satisfactory agreement with the dragons, Otaaryliakkarnos offers to return to Waterdeep to let the council know an agreement has been reached. The details and terms—including any concessions promised by the characters—can be discussed during the next council session. If the characters do not reach an agreement because they cannot or will not meet the dragons' demands, Otaaryliakkarnos flies them back but departs Waterdeep at once.
