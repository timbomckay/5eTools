  "title": "Appendix C: Creatures",
  "weight": 22
}

This appendix describes new creatures that appear in the adventure, presenting them in alphabetical order. The introduction of the Monster Manual explains how to interpret a creature's stat block.

Several of the creatures in this appendix are common beasts—foxes, hares, mountain goats, seals, sperm whales, and walruses—that live among other beasts from the Monster Manual, such as polar bears, deer, elk, reindeer (use the elk stat block), killer whales, mammoths, moose (use the giant goat stat block), saber-toothed tigers, snowy owls, woolly rhinoceroses, and wolves. And then there's the notoriously ugly knucklehead trout, without which there would be no Ten-Towns.

If the adventuring party includes a wizard who can prepare the <wc-fetch type="spell">find familiar</wc-fetch> spell, consider allowing the wizard to add the fox and the hare to the spell's list of eligible familiars.

### Arcane Brotherhood

The Arcane Brotherhood is a cabal of powerful wizards that operates out of the Hosttower of the Arcane, a multi-spired structure that towers above Luskan (a city south of Icewind Dale on the Sword Coast). The brotherhood's leadership consists of five renowned archmages who handpick the other members, favoring wizards of great accomplishment. Every year, scores of wizards from across Faerûn flock to the Hosttower of the Arcane, hoping to gain admittance into the prestigious ranks of the brotherhood. Nearly all candidates are dismissed out of hand, without so much as a test, feeding rumors that the brotherhood's leaders are more interested in marketing their own brand of exclusivity than finding new talent. Yet wizards seem willing to debase themselves regardless, for admittance to the brotherhood grants access to the Hosttower's incredible libraries of magical lore.

The truth behind the brotherhood's ongoing quest for new members is based on the adage, "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer." The brotherhood's leaders seek out wizards who might by their exploits compete with the brotherhood's acquisition and hoarding of arcane lore and magical secrets. By bringing these wizards into the fold, the brotherhood turns potential enemies into colleagues, in effect neutralizing future threats.

Once welcomed into the brotherhood, wizards are free to pursue their own interests so long as they place the security and sanctity of the Hosttower and the cabal above all else. When not rallying to defend their home, wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood act like friendly and unfriendly rivals to one another, striving to outdo their peers in magic. Open conflict between members is forbidden, yet members are adroit at finding underhanded ways to needle and sabotage one another.

The Arcane Brotherhood sent three of its members to investigate rumors of a lost Netherese enclave that crashed in Icewind Dale nearly two thousand years ago. A fourth wizard, Nass Lantomir, learned about the expedition and decided to form her own.

Not long after they arrived in Bryn Shander, the three wizards who had formed the initial expeditionary force parted company, each one determined to be the first to find the enclave—such is the fragile nature of wizardly alliances. The four wizards are described below:

Avarice, an albino tiefling evoker with a pair of gargoyle companions

Dzaan's Simulacrum, a human illusionist and Red Wizard of Thay who perished recently, but whose simulacrum lives on

Nass Lantomir's Ghost, a human diviner who died and now exists as a spellcasting ghost

Vellynne Harpell, a human necromancer from a famous family with a cadre of kobolds—some living, others undead

### Goliaths

At the highest mountain peaks—far above the slopes where trees grow, where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl—dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few other folk can truthfully claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still to have forged a friendship with one.

Goliaths love to compete and keep score, counting up their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to what others have done. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as an incentive to improve their skills. Above all else, every goliath is driven to outdo their past performance, taking greater and greater risks. As a result, few goliaths live to see old age.

#### Goliath Names

Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn's mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name.

- <b>Birth Names</b> Aukan, Eglath, Gae-Al, Gauthak, Ilikan, Keothi, Kuori, Lo-Kag, Manneo, Maveith, Nalla, Orilo, Paavu, Pethani, Thalai, Thotham, Uthal, Vaunea, Vimak
- <b>Nicknames</b> Bearkiller, Dawncaller, Fearless, Flintfinder, Horncarver, Keeneye, Lonehunter, Longleaper, Rootsmasher, Steadyhand, Threadtwister, Twice-Orphaned, Twistedlimb, Wordpainter
- <b>Clan Names</b> Akannathi, Anakalathai, Elanithino, Gathakanathi, Kalagiano, Katho-Olavi, Kolae-Gileana, Ogolakanu, Thuliaga, Thunukalathi, Thuunlakalaga

#### Goliath Player Characters

With your consent, any player in your game can play a goliath character. A goliath native to Icewind Dale can be a member of the Skytower (Akannathi) clan, the Wyrmdoom (Thuunlakalaga) clan, or another goliath clan that you and the player create together.

#### Spine of the World Goliaths

Goliaths inhabit the Spine of the World, where their mettle is tested against Orc, Ogre, Frost Giant, Remorhaz, Ice Troll, Young White Dragon, the treacherous mountain terrain, and the cruel indifference of nature.

##### Bitter Rivals

Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag are two mountain strongholds inhabited by goliaths. The former is home to the Skytower (Akannathi) clan, the latter to the Wyrmdoom (Thuunlakalaga) clan. The two groups refuse to get along, and competition between them is fierce and often violent. They stare at each other across mountain peaks and fight over everything from necessities to territory. The likelihood of peace between them is remote, because goliaths like to hold grudges.

### Kobolds

Kobolds can be found anywhere dragons are known to dwell, and those that live in the mountains and hills of Icewind Dale are among the hardiest of their kind. Drawn to the north by a desire to find and serve white dragons, these kobolds adapted as best they can to the hostile climate. Their sensitive eyes appreciate sunless days and long, dark nights. They use wooden javelins as tools to test the snow ahead of them.

Kobolds native to Icewind Dale frequently wander into Ten-Towns to escape the dreadful cold, hoping to trade what few skills they have for some warm soup and shelter. The people of Ten-Towns, accustomed to the presence of strange outlanders, allow these kobolds to dwell among them for the most part. When the kobolds don't feel safe, they acquire heavy winter clothing and disguise themselves as humans by standing on one another's shoulders. Three kobolds in cold weather gear can pass themselves off as a clumsy human with a successful group Charisma (<wc-fetch type="skill">Deception</wc-fetch>) check, the DC of which equals the onlooker's Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Insight</wc-fetch>) check result.

#### Icewind Kobold Zombie

The necromancer Vellynne Harpell has Icewind kobold guides in her employ, including a pair that died and were turned into Icewind Kobold Zombie using <wc-fetch type="spell">animate dead</wc-fetch> spells. The cold climate helps to preserve their dead flesh.

#### Kobold Vampire Spawn

The gnoll vampire Tekeli-li has a small number of kobold vampire spawn minions to keep it company in the Caves of Hunger (see chapter 6). The vampiric kobolds are terrified of the gnoll vampire and can't understand its commands, so they give Tekeli-li a wide berth. These ravenous undead kobolds thirst for blood and tend to swarm one foe at a time.

### Magen

Magen are magical, humanlike beings created by a wizard spell (see the <wc-fetch type="spell">create magen</wc-fetch>) or by other arcane methods.

Though magen look like humanoids with green skin, they are constructs. When one is wounded, its blood is seen to have the color and consistency of mercury. They exist purely through magical means. When one is killed, its body disappears in a burst of harmless fire and a cloud of smoke that quickly dissipates.

##### Magical Servants

Magen make ideal servants. At creation, each is instilled with an instinct to protect itself and its creator, and it follows its creator's instructions without hesitation. When its task is complete, a magen stands immobile and silent until its creator gives it new orders.

### Reghed Nomads

Reghed nomads are the children of the Reghed Glacier, as suggested by their name. They are people of the wild, as revealed by their tribal names—the Elk, the Tiger, the Wolf, the Bear. They are the tribes of Icewind Dale, proud and strong, bound to ancient traditions that have kept them alive through countless harsh winters. The Reghed wear heavy furs as well as gloves, boots, and masks made of animal hide, to protect themselves from the bitter cold.

Although they originally descended from humans who were predominantly blue-eyed and fair-haired, the Reghed tribes have assimilated other folk, adding new blood to their dwindling ranks. There used to be more than four Reghed tribes, but the others have all disbanded over the past century, with many of their former members settling in Ten-Towns and abandoning their traditional ways.

The Reghed tribes rely on a nomadic lifestyle to survive, as they follow herds of reindeer along the route of the animals' annual migration. When they make camp, the tribesfolk live in large, round tents made of deerskin and supported by wooden shafts. (See map 2.11 for a typical Reghed camp configuration.)

The Monster Manual has stat blocks that can represent most members of a Reghed tribe, as shown in the Reghed Tribesfolk table.

#### Reghed Tribesfolk

| Role | Stat Block |
| - | - |
| Hunter or Reghed Warrior | Tribal warrior with <wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch> +4; speaks Common |
| Reghed Shaman | Druid with <wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch> +4; speaks Common and Druidic |
| Reghed Chieftain or Reghed Great Warrior | Gladiator with hide armor instead of studded leather and <wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch> +5; speaks Common |

#### Tribe of the Bear

Internal strife has splintered what remains of the Bear Tribe today. The turmoil began shortly after a band of Bear Tribe hunters recovered pieces of chardalyn from the frozen corpses of several dwarves. Oblivious to the demonic magic suffusing the crystal, tribe members used the shards to fashion heads for their spears and axes. Contact with the crystal corrupted these warriors over time, turning them into Chardalyn Berserker. Their cruelty forced the king to banish them from the tribe. These outcasts have since begun raiding Bear Tribe camps for sacrifices, which they offer up to Auril to gain the Frostmaiden's favor.

#### King Gunvald Halraggson

The thirty-year-old Bear King cuts an impressive figure and is renowned for his size and strength. He tries to be honorable, but he is often merciless and doesn't change his mind easily. He has trouble relating to Ten-Towners, so he avoids them. His perspective on townsfolk might change if they helped him destroy the chardalyn berserkers who have turned against their own.

Gunvald has had three wives in six years, each of whom died while she was pregnant. His advisors fear that the gods have cursed Gunvald and the entire tribe. In truth, the king's doting shaman, Ulkora, lusts for him and surreptitiously poisoned his wives. In time, Ulkora hopes Gunvald will turn his loving eye toward her and allow her to bear his true heir. If Gunvald were to learn the truth, he would put Ulkora to death.

#### Tribe of the Elk

Of the four remaining Reghed tribes, the Tribe of the Elk is the largest and the most tolerant of outsiders. It's also the tribe of the hero Wulfgar, son of Beornegar.

Members of the Elk Tribe view the people of Ten-Towns as "tame folk," who are ill bred and ill equipped for life in Icewind Dale. The tribe keeps its distance from Ten-Towns to avoid misunderstandings, since the appearance of Elk Tribe hunters near Ten-Towns has been known to panic Ten-Towners who live in constant fear of attack.

#### King Jarund Elkhardt

The Elk King is Jarund Elkhardt, a terse yet thoughtful giant of a man who is nearly fifty years old—ancient by tribal standards. He has led the Elk Tribe for over half his life, and age has made him cautious. He has seen other kings and queens rise and fall, has made war with friends and peace with his enemies, and has led warriors he knew as babes to their deaths in battle. The strain of his long years of rule is etched on his weather-worn face.

Jarund's late son, Jarund Twice-Born, was killed almost a decade ago while trying to bring down a cave bear, leaving Jarund without an heir. He has failed to produce another child with his wife, Wynneth, and his mistress, Froya, so the future of his royal line remains uncertain.

Auril's unyielding winter concerns Jarund deeply, and he often turns to his shaman, Mjenir, for guidance. The king respects the shaman's understanding of gods and spirits, and the fact that both men have lost their sons serves to strengthen the bond between them. Mjenir believes that the only way to break Auril's spell is to slay the goddess in her home, but Jarund believes that his warriors aren't strong enough to accomplish that task alone.

#### Tribe of the Tiger

The Tiger Tribe shuns the stronger Elk Tribe and preys on the weaker Bear and Wolf tribes. Of all the Reghed tribes, the Tiger Tribe is the most comfortable preying on the weakness of their rivals as well as Ten-Towns.

#### Queen Bjornhild Solvigsdottir

It's unusual for a woman to lead a Reghed tribe, but Bjornhild is a most extraordinary woman. The fearless wife of the late King Korold, she fought alongside him in many battles. After a frost giant's mammoth companion slew Korold, the formidable Bjornhild took his place.

Bjornhild worships the Frostmaiden and is so ruthless that her enemies believe she has actual ice flowing through her veins. She has no living children that she knows of, but with Auril's blessing, she won't need any heirs to preserve her legacy. Bjornhild intends to live forever by demonstrating her unwavering faith in the Frostmaiden and becoming the Chosen of Auril.

As if she weren't fearsome enough, Bjornhild has a pet saber-toothed tiger named Grava.

![Queen Bjornhild Solvigsdottir and her saber-toothed tiger, Grava](adventure/IDRotF/250-08-015.bjornhild.png)

#### Tribe of the Wolf

The Wolf Tribe is the smallest of the four remaining Reghed tribes, and even its most optimistic members don't think it will survive much longer under its current leadership. To swell its ranks, chieftains have resorted to bringing outsiders into the fold, including outcasts from Ten-Towns, disenfranchised members of other Reghed tribes, and even goblinoids.

#### Isarr Kronenstrom

The Wolf Tribe has been without a king or queen for years. Its most powerful chieftain, Isarr Kronenstrom, is a psychotic brute who worships Malar the Beast Lord. He hunts Ten-Towners for sport, bathes in their blood, and strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. Several members of Isarr's clan have deserted him or been killed off, but the few that remain are fiercely loyal. They believe, incorrectly, that he's the Chosen of Malar.

Although Isarr calls himself the Wolf King, few others in the Wolf Tribe support him in that claim, but the other Wolf clan chieftains are too weak and disorganized to challenge him.
