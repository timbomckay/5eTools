In the far reaches of the world, under a lost and lonely hill, lies the sinister Tomb of Horrors. This labyrinthine crypt is filled with terrible traps, strange and ferocious monsters, rich and magical treasures, and somewhere within rests the demilich.

The legend of the tomb is an old story with many parts, some of which may be lost or obscured. Characters attempting to glean special information by consulting sages or through legend lore spells may still have difficulty obtaining as much background as they desire, for the scraps of information thus gained are often minimal and mystical.

The essentials of the legend can be furnished to the players from the following section.

## Legend of the Tomb

Somewhere under a lost and lonely hill of grim and foreboding aspect lies a labyrinthine crypt. It is filled with terrible traps and not a few strange and ferocious monsters to slay the unwary. It is filled with rich treasures both precious and magical, but in addition to the aforementioned guardians, there is said to be a demilich who still wards his final haunt. Be warned that tales have it that this being, called Acererak, possesses powers that make him nearly undefeatable!

All accounts conclude that it is quite unlikely any explorers will ever find the chamber where the demilich lingers, for the passages and rooms of the tomb are fraught with traps, poison gases, and magical protections. Furthermore, the demilich has so well hidden his lair that even those who avoid the pitfalls will not be likely to locate their true goal. Only large and well-prepared parties of the bravest and strongest should even consider the attempt, and if such a group does locate the tomb, they must be prepared to fail. Any expedition must have magical protections and weapons, and must be equipped with every sort of device possible to ensure survival.

### The Truth Behind the Legend

Ages ago, a human wizard/cleric of surpassing evil took the steps necessary to preserve his life force beyond the centuries he had already lived, and this creature became the lich known as Acererak. Over the scores of years which followed, the lich dwelled with hordes of ghastly servants in the gloomy stone halls of the very hill where the tomb is.

Eventually even the undead life force of Acererak began to wane, so for the next eight decades, the lich's servants labored to create the Tomb of Horrors. Then Acererak destroyed all his slaves and servitors, magically hid the entrance to his halls, and went to reside in his final haunt, while his soul roamed strange planes unknown to even the wisest of sages. If the characters gain access to the innermost part of the tomb where the lich's crypt lies, their actions along the way will have caused his soul to be called back to the Material Plane and alerted Acererak, now a demilich, that interlopers have invaded his resting place.

## Running the Adventure

As clever players will gather from the information in the "Legend of the Tomb," this dungeon has more tricks and traps than it has monsters to fight. This is a thinking person's adventure, and if your group is a hack-and-slay gathering, they will be unhappy! Only high-level characters stand a chance of surviving, but every player who braves the tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.

Negotiation of the tomb will require quite a long time, so be prepared to spend several sessions with this material. When the game ends for the day, assume the expedition is spending the intervening time resting and recovering until play again commences. Since there are no monsters to be randomly encountered within the tomb, the party might be able to encamp close to the entrance without fear of being disturbed, but if you do so opt, do not inform the players of this.

As characters enter the various areas, read aloud appropriate sections of text, but never give any additional information that player characters would have no way of knowing, and avoid facial expressions or voice tones that might either give helpful hints or mislead players. The real enjoyment of this adventure is in managing to cope, and those players who do so with even moderate success will appreciate your refereeing properly and allowing them to "live or die" on their own.

The starting information given here simply assumes that the expedition has arrived at the site of the Tomb of Horrors. After relating the salient features of the "Legend of the Tomb," you may fill in whatever other background is needed to get the characters to the site.

> ### Placing the Adventure
> 
> In the original Tomb of Horrors, Gary Gygax suggested six possible, far-flung locations for the adventure in the Greyhawk setting—proof in itself that the tomb is liable to turn up just about anywhere. Those possibilities are as follows:
> 
> 
> 
> - Inside the highest hill on the Plains of Iuz
> 
> - On an island (unmapped) in the Nyr Dyv
> 
> - In the Bright Desert
> 
> - At the western border of the Duchy of Geoff
> 
> - Somewhere in the Vast Swamp south of Sunndi
> 
> - On an island beyond the realm of the Sea Barons
> 
> Other settings offer choices that are just as varied.
> 
> **Dragonlance:** The tomb on Krynn might be in the foothills near the Eastwall Mountains, in the Cursed Lands of Newsea, or in the Shadowglades of Krynn, where a renegade wizard who served Takhisis was said to dwell.
> 
> **Eberron:** Appropriate sites for the tomb in Eberron include the Ashen Spires of Karrnath, or among the tors in the Vile Marsh between Droaam and the Shadow Marches. among Shargon's Teeth. Eberron's Boneyard could hide the tomb and thus speak to Acererak's enmity for Eberron's dragons.
> 
> **Forgotten Realms:** The tomb could be in the Serpent Hills or the Trielta Hills on Faerûn. It could be in the High Moor or amid the isles that make up the Korinn Archipelago in the Moonshaes. It might be somewhere in the Anauroch desert, perhaps tying Acererak to ancient Netheril.

> ### About the Original
> 
> _Tomb of Horrors_ was born in Gary Gygax's home campaign and introduced to the world at the first Origins game convention in 1975. Since its original publication in 1978, _Tomb of Horrors_ has risen to legendary status among D&D players and is generally regarded as one of the greatest adventures of all time.
> 
> In the words of its creator, "This is a thinking person's adventure." It was designed not for player characters of a certain level—though high-level adventurers are certainly necessary—but for players who enjoy a mental challenge and DMs who want to put their own spin on this truly unique dungeon.

### Adventure Start

The characters have arrived at the site of the demilich's last haunt. Before them is a low, flat topped hill, about 200 yards wide, 300 yards long, and 60 feet high. Only ugly weeds, thorns, and briars grow upon the steep sides and bald top of the mound. There are black rocks upon the top of the hill, and if these are viewed from a height of about 200 feet or so above the mound, it will be seen that the whole is shaped like a human skull, with piles of rock appearing as eyeholes, a nose hole, and the jagged teeth of a grinning death's head.

A thorough inspection and search of the entire area reveals only that the north side of the hill has a crumbling cliff of sand and gravel about 20 feet high in the middle of the whole. (This cliff face is represented by the northern edge of the map.) A low stone ledge overhangs this eroded area, and shrubs and bushes obscure it from observation at a distance.

It takes 10 minutes for characters to search each 10-foot-wide space along the cliff face. This examination must be done from a distance, using a long spear or a 10-foot pole to poke into the sand and gravel, looking for an opening. Any prodding into the cliff face must be sufficiently high off the ground in order to collapse enough material to expose a portion of a tunnel entrance. Once an entrance is exposed, it takes about 1 hour for characters to thoroughly clear the passage that lies beyond, but a crawl space can be opened in 10 minutes.

Probing of the gravel and sand face can begin wherever the characters choose—east side, west side, middle, several locations at once or merely a single one at a time. Leave this strictly to the players to decide. The best manner to handle it is to ask where they will search, once they have determined that they will investigate the area and they have stated how it will be done and with what. Remember that probing low to the ground, or probing with short implements (daggers, swords, and the like) will not reveal anything.

As soon as any entrance is cleared and entered, go to the appropriate location on the map: either **area 1**, **area 2**, or **area 3**.

> #### Demonic Attention
> 
> Characters who become astral or ethereal in the tomb might attract a demon. Roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> whenever this occurs. On a roll of 1 to 16, no demon appears. Otherwise the following demons could appear: 17, a vrock; 18, a hezrou; 19, a glabrezu; or 20, a nalfeshnee.

## Locations in the Tomb

The following locations are identified on the map.

<wc-gallery>

![DM Map](adventure/TftYP/ToH-DM.png)

![Player Map](adventure/TftYP/ToH-Player.png)

</wc-gallery>

#### 1. False Entrance Tunnel

If the characters clear the passage on the west side of the cliff face, read:

> The corridor before you is made of plain stone, roughly worked, and it is dark and full of cobwebs. The ceiling overhead is obscured by hanging strands of webbing.

Casual observation will not reveal that the ceiling, 20 feet overhead, is composed of badly fitting stones. The cobwebs must be burned away for someone to be able to inspect the tunnel ceiling. Anyone who does so and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check realizes that the ceiling is unstable and in danger of collapse.

Daylight is sufficient to reveal a pair of oaken doors at the end of the passageway. The doors open outward by means of great iron ring pulls. When either door is opened, it is revealed to be a false door, and the trap is triggered.

##### Ceiling Trap

If the ceiling is prodded with any force, or if the doors are opened, the ceiling of the tunnel collapses. Creatures under the collapse must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (<wc-roll>5d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap mechanism is beyond the doors and inside the ceiling, so it can't be disabled from outside.

#### 2. False Entrance Tunnel

If the characters clear the passage on the east side of the cliff face, read:

> The corridor before you is made of plain stone, roughly worked and mortared, with a 10-foot-high ceiling.

Daylight will enable adventurers to dimly see what appear to be two separate doors at the end of the corridor.

The paving stones on the floor 50 feet south of the entrance are unmortared and shift slightly when characters tread upon the surface. A character who inspects the floor in this section and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices the change in the floor. A character can use <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch> to keep the stones from shifting by taking 1 minute and succeeding on a DC 20 Dexterity check. On a failed check, the shims are put in place but they fail when someone moves across the stone, and the trap is triggered.

##### Sliding Block Trap

If the paving stones shift when someone moves across them, a 10-foot-thick block of stone emerges from the midpoint of the eastern wall and begins to slide into the corridor. Have the players roll initiative. On each initiative count, the block slides 6 inches to the west, until at initiative count 1, it completely blocks the corridor. The block's movement can be stopped by using an iron bar or a similarly sturdy normal object, but only if the object is placed on the floor where it can be wedged into the space between the block and the floor. If the block moves far enough to prevent the characters from escaping, they have to devise a means to bypass it. It can't be moved or forced backward.

The doors at the end of the passage are false ones.

#### 3. Entrance to the Tomb of Horrors

Even a bit of light entering through a crawl space or provided by a torch will reveal that an unusual tunnel lies ahead. If the characters clear the passage near the center of the cliff face, read:

> Bright, brilliant colors are to be seen everywhere, the stones and pigments undimmed by the passage of decades. The floor of the corridor is a colorful mosaic of stone, with a distinct, winding path of red tiles about two feet wide snaking its way south down the corridor. No stonework can be seen on the walls or the ceiling twenty feet above, for some sort of cement or plaster has been smoothed over all of these surfaces and then illustrated.
> 
> The scenes show fields with kine grazing, a copse with several wolves in the background, workers of various races and strange human-animal mixtures—pig-human, ape-human, and dog-human—going about various tasks. Certain of the frescoes show rooms of some building—a library filled with many books and scrolls, the door of a torture chamber, and a wizard's work room. There are chairs, windows, boxes, bales, doors, chests, birds, bats, spiders, and all manner of things shown on the walls.

This corridor contains five covered pits (**area see below**). On the west wall adjacent to the northernmost pit is where the torture chamber is painted. The wall hiding the passage to the west shows a depiction of an iron door that evidently confines some sort of horrid creature (its taloned and scaled hands grasp the bars of its small window). If the plaster and lath beneath this image is broken away, a normal, inward-opening door will be revealed. If the plaster remains intact, the door can be discovered only by magical means.

##### Message from Acererak

If the path of red tiles on the floor is carefully observed and studied all the way from the entrance to where the path forks toward **area areas 5** and **area 6**, the individual with such perseverance will be rewarded by suddenly understanding that a message is contained in barely noticeable runes in the mosaic floor.

The message reads:

> Acererak congratulates you on your powers of observation, so make of this whatever you wish, for you will be mine in the end no matter what!
> 
> Go back to the tormentor or through the arch, and the second great hall you'll discover.
> 
> Shun green if you can, but night's good color is for those of great valor.
> 
> If shades of red stand for blood, the wise will not need sacrifice aught but a loop of magical metal-you're well along your march.
> 
> Two pits along the way will be found to lead to a fortuitous fall, so check the wall.
> 
> These keys and those are most important of all, and beware of trembling hands and what will maul.
> 
> If you find the false you find the true, and into the columned hall you'll come, and there the throne that's key and keyed.
> 
> The iron men of visage grim do more than meets the viewer's eye.
> 
> You've left and left and found my tomb, and now your souls will die.

![undefined](adventure/TftYP/ToHCorridor.jpg)

#### 4. Fresco of the Wizardly Work Room

> The most outstanding feature in this location is actually outstanding! Two jackal-headed human figures are painted so as to appear to be holding a real bronze chest that protrudes from the wall.

##### Poison Needle Trap

If the chest is examined closely, the viewer will note that it is hinged on the bottom so as to allow the lid to swing down if a catch on the top is pressed. The catch has an easily seen poison needle trap—the needle sticks 3 inches out of the wall—and the needle can be avoided easily by pressing the catch with the pommel of a dagger. Disabling the trap by taking the needle out of the mechanism requires the use of <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch> and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check.

The needle deals 1 piercing damage and 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) poison damage if it hits someone. Someone who takes this poison damage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become <wc-fetch type="condition">poisoned</wc-fetch> for 1 hour.

##### Deep Covered Pit

If the chest is opened, it appears to be empty, but a character who actually feels inside the chest will find a rod that protrudes vertically from the bottom. This lever moves easily, and if it is pulled with any force it will open a trapdoor in this square that covers a 30-foot-deep covered pit (see **area the sidebar**). Someone who falls in takes damage from a 30-foot fall as well as from the spikes and the poison.

The trapdoor over this pit is 3 feet thick and can't be detected by sounding, and it is technically not a trap, so a <wc-fetch type="spell">find traps</wc-fetch> spell doesn't reveal it. A <wc-fetch type="spell">true seeing</wc-fetch> spell reveals a tiny rectangular gap where the door meets the floor. Once the trapdoor falls away, the pit remains open thereafter.

> #### Covered Pits
> 
> Pit traps throughout the tomb, except where otherwise noted, are constructed as covered pits. Each one is 10 feet deep and concealed by a counterweighted trapdoor that looks like the floor and opens as soon as any person steps on it.
> 
> A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check discerns the edges of a pit's lid. In addition, someone who prods a pit lid can force the lid to open with a successful DC 10 Strength check. The lid can be wedged shut with a <wc-fetch type="item">piton</wc-fetch> or a similar object. A character must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check to place the shim properly. On a failed check, the shim fails if someone treads on the lid.
> 
> Each pit is spiked at the bottom, so someone who falls in takes falling damage plus 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) piercing damage from the spikes. The spikes are also poisoned, so someone injured by them must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### 5. The Arch of Mist

One section of the path shown on the floor leads directly into a stone archway. If any character stands within 2 feet of the entranceway upon the path, read:

> The stone archway before you is filled with a veil of thick vapors. The stones on either side of the base and the keystone protrude slightly from the stones around them. As you move to within touching distance, the left-hand base stone begins to glow yellow, the right-hand base stone orange, and the keystone seven feet above blue.

Nothing will cause the vapors to clear, nor will any sort of magic allow sight into the area, until the glowing stones are pressed in the proper sequence: yellow, blue, orange. If this is done, the vapors disappear, and the path appears to go eastward.

If the archway is entered when it is clouded, those characters doing so will be instantly teleported to **area 7**. If it is passed through after pressing the glowing stones in proper sequence, those who step through while following the path will be teleported to **area 11**, and those who pass through off the path will be sent back to **area 3**.

#### 6. The Face of the Great Green Devil

The path of red tiles leads south from the fork. If any character comes within 2 feet of the southern wall, read:

> On the wall before you is a relief sculpture of a devil face formed of mosaic tiles. The face has a huge O of a mouth, inside of which the space is dead black.

##### Aura

The devil face radiates an aura of transmutation magic if <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> is used on it, and a casting of <wc-fetch type="spell">detect evil and good</wc-fetch> or a paladin's use of Divine Sense reveals it as a desecrated place.

##### Mouth Trap

The mouth opening is similar to a <wc-fetch type="item">sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch>, but it is about 3 feet in diameter—plenty of room for those who wish to leap in and be completely and forever destroyed. A character who examines the mouth and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Arcana</wc-fetch>) check identifies the trap for what it is.

#### 7. The Forsaken Prison

> This miserable cubicle appears to have absolutely no means of egress. Three iron levers, each about one foot long, protrude from the south wall of the chamber.

Even a magical means of detection will not indicate any way out of this place.

##### Levers

The iron levers can be moved horizontally or vertically, singly or in combination. Only the act of moving all three together upward or downward has any results. Moving them up opens a small trapdoor in the center of the ceiling 10 feet above. Pushing them simultaneously down opens the entire floor to a 100-foot-deep pit with no exit. The floor returns to a closed position in 10 minutes, sealing any victim inside the pit until another creature triggers the floor trap again.

##### Crawl Space

The ceiling route is a crawl space some 3 feet square. At the place it turns east there is a plug in the ceiling, which can be detected only with magic or if a character has sense enough to check for secret doors. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check can find the door. Also, anyone who raps or sounds on the ceiling in the door's area hears it is hollow, indicating a space beyond. Eventually the small tunnel leads to a magical one-way door, which opens in the pit side as shown, and players are back to square one.

#### 8. Gargoyle Lair

When any door leading to the lair is opened, it frees the room's occupant from temporal stasis.

> What appeared to be a statue an instant ago comes to life before your eyes. The creature flaps its wings and stares at you.

##### Creature

A mutated, four-armed gargoyle attacks anyone who enters its lair. This creature uses Multiattack to make three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

##### Treasure

Around the creature's neck is a collar studded with ten gleaming gems (blue quartz stones of 100 gp value each).

Hidden in a secret compartment of the collar is a slip of parchment with the following written on it in magical code (requiring <wc-fetch type="spell">comprehend languages</wc-fetch> to understand): "Look low and high for gold, to hear a tale untold. Take the archway at the end, and on your way you'll wend." Beneath the runes, the initial "A" is inscribed.

#### 9. Complex of Secret Doors

If someone opens the door on the east wall of **area 8**, read:

> The small room beyond the door is empty and appears to have no other exits.

The south wall contains the first in a series of secret doors. Each of these portals requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check to find and must be opened by hand using a particular method, as follows:

- A. Pull down and inward (hinged on bottom)
- B. Pivot on central hinge
- C. Pull inward and up at bottom (hinged on top)
- D. Slide up
- E. Pull double panels inward (hinged on sides)
- F. Slide left
- G. Door has seven studs in a row—press all at once and door opens, but press 1 and 7 and the door falls inward. A character pressing the studs or near enough to do so must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage from the falling door.

##### Bolts from Above

Each round that characters are in any of the rooms inside the complex of secret doors, a number of bolts will be fired into the area from hidden devices in the walls and ceilings, and there is a <wc-roll chance>50 percent</wc-roll> chance that one character, randomly determined, in each such area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) piercing damage. There is no way to prevent the bolts from being triggered.

#### 10. Great Hall of Spheres

This area is similar to **area 3**, for the floor is of inlaid tiles and the walls and ceiling are painted with figures of animals, strange signs and glyphs (which mean absolutely nothing), and humans and human-like creatures posing with spheres of different colors. These globes are two-dimensional, of course, and their significance and pattern are described below. From north to south, with the west wall being the left-hand column, and the east the right-hand, the spheres are colored and positioned as follows:

| West Wall | East Wall |
| - | - |
| Gold, held high overhead¹ | Pale blue, held at shoulder |
| Orange, held waist high | Silver, at feet |
| (False door) | (Secret one-way door²) |
| Purple, at feet | Green, held high overhead |
| (False door) | Yellow, held at shoulder |
| Bronze, held waist high | Pink held high overhead |
| Gray, held at shoulder | Black, at feet³ |
| (None) | Pale violet, held at shoulder |
| Bright blue, at feet | (None) |
| White, held high overhead | Red, held waist high⁴ |
| Turquoise, held at shoulder | Buff, at feet |
| Scarlet, held waist high | (None) |
| Pale green, at feet | Indigo, held high overhead |

The false doors and secret doors can be found with successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) checks. If anyone makes physical contact with an illusion in this area, its nature becomes apparent. Also, a character who examines an illusory image without touching it can make a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type="skill">Investigation</wc-fetch>) check. On a successful check, the illusion becomes faint to the character, who can then easily see the crawlway beyond the illusion.

##### Magic Archway

On the south wall is a stone archway similar in appearance to **area 5**, also filled with cloudy vapors that block vision or detection of what lies beyond. When a character moves to within 3 feet of the arch, read:

> As you come close, three stones in the archway in front of you begin to glow. The left-hand base stone shines with an olive hue; the one on the right glows citron, and the keystone seven feet overhead gives off russet light.

No matter how the stones are manipulated, the archway remains clouded and veiled with a haze which nothing can enable the onlookers to see through. All living matter which goes through the arch will be teleported to **area 3**, while nonliving matter is teleported simultaneously to **area 33**—meaning that characters stepping through will appear at the start totally nude, while everything else with them will go to the crypt of the demilich. (Cruel, but most entertaining for the DM.)

#### 11. The Three-Armed Statue

> This small room holds what appears to be a statue of a gargoyle, eight feet tall, with four arms. One of the arms is broken off and lies on the floor in front of the statue.

![Statue](adventure/TftYP/ToHStatue.jpg)

No amount of fooling around with the broken arm will enable it to be replaced, and the statue will do nothing at all meanwhile.

##### Ten Gems for One

A close look at the open and outstretched hands of the statue will determine that a large gem (a 100 gp blue quartz fits perfectly) will fit in a carved depression in each of the three remaining hands, while the broken one has no such concavity. If three large gems of any sort are placed within the hands, the stony digits will close and crush them to powder, dump the remains on the floor, and return to their normal positions.

If this process is repeated until ten gems (or more) are crushed, a <wc-fetch type="spell">magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell is triggered and speaks the following words: "Your sacrifice was not in vain. Look to the fourth to find your gain."

As these words are uttered, an invisible <wc-fetch type="item">gem of seeing</wc-fetch> will come into being in the palm of the broken-off arm. The gem must be found, and the character so doing will need to wipe it free of a magical substance before it can be seen or used. Note that if the arm is carelessly moved, the gem will fall out and roll away. <wc-fetch type="spell">See invisibility</wc-fetch> or any other sort of searching except by careful feeling will be useless. Describe the gem, once it is wiped clean and visible, as an oval diamond, with two flat and polished sides, very clear, and about 1 inch in diameter by a quarter-inch thick. It will operate only twelve times, then shatter.

#### 12. Trapped False Doors

In four locations in the tomb, there are false doors which screen a spear trap. When one of these doors is opened, a spear will shoot out, and the door opener or someone standing nearby is subject to be struck. Determine at random, if need be, which character is the target. The trap has a range of 60 feet, has a **+11** bonus to hit, and deals 9 (<wc-roll>2d8</wc-roll>) piercing damage. If the door is closed and reopened, another spear will fire. The mechanism can be jammed by a character who uses <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch> and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check.

#### 13. Chamber of Three Chests

When the party enters the illusory crawlway hidden by the red sphere, they will come to an apparent dead end, but a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check reveals the presence of a secret door.

The character who opens the door will fall to the floor 10 feet below due to a tilting stone at the mouth of the crawlway, taking falling damage (a mere annoyance, but it erodes the strength of the party).

Three large chests are affixed firmly to the floor; the western one is gold (plate covering iron), the center one is silver (plate over iron), and the eastern one is of oak bound with thick bronze bands. Each is about 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 3 feet high.

##### Gold

Opening the gold chest releases a swarm of poisonous snakes that slither out and attack next round. They continue biting until all are killed.

##### Silver

Inside the silver chest is a clear crystal box (worth 1,000 gp) that holds a <wc-fetch type="item">ring of protection</wc-fetch>. Someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check while examining the box and the chest notices the box is set into the chest bottom. When this box is lifted from the supposed bottom of the chest, eight darts will fire upward, and the one or two characters leaning over the chest so as to be in the line of fire will take <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> attacks each if they are exposed to the path of these missiles. The darts have a range of 60 feet, a **++11** bonus to hit, and deal 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) damage on a hit. The trap mechanism is under the crystal box and can't be disabled without first removing the box.

##### Oak

When the lid of the oak chest is opened, an animated giant skeleton will be instantly teleported into the room, and it strikes with surprise.

#### 14. Chapel of Evil

After passing through the illusory black sphere the party will have crawled along the small tunnel until reaching the end, only to find it is solid stone. It requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check to find the secret door at the end of the passage—no form of magic will detect it, save for a <wc-fetch type="item">gem of seeing</wc-fetch>. If the characters open the door and enter the room, read:

> You see what is obviously some form of temple area. There are scenes of normal life painted on the walls, but the people have rotting flesh, skeletal hands, worms eating them, and so forth. Yet there are also depicted various religious symbols of good alignment. There is a mosaic path leading between four rows of wooden pews that face the worship area. In front of the pews, a wooden railing divides the room. South of it is an altar in front of a tiered dais, on which sits a wooden chair.

If the characters move farther into the room so they can see the features in the south end, continue:

> The chair is nicely carved and padded but seems unremarkable. On either side of the dais are large, free-standing large brass candelabras each holding five white candles. In each corner on the southern wall is a large white pottery urn stoppered with a brass and wood plug. Sprawled on the floor near the west wall is human skeleton in black chain mail that is badly rusted and damaged. The skeleton's outstretched arm points to a stone archway set in the wall. The opening is filled with opaque, bright orange vapors.

##### Aura

A casting of <wc-fetch type="spell">detect evil and good</wc-fetch> or a paladin's use of Divine Sense identifies the chapel as a consecrated place. (What a puzzle! Could the demilich actually have been of good alignment?)

##### Pews

Simple examination indicates that all of the benches have hinged seats. If a character examines either of the pews in the front row before opening the lid, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check reveals that the hinges on this pew are larger than the ones on the pews in the other rows.

##### Gas Trap

The hinges on the front pews are larger and stronger because they include rods that are connected to valves inside the pew. If the seat on either of the front pews is lifted up, a cloud of poison gas fills the whole room in 2 rounds. A character caught in the gas must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become <wc-fetch type="condition">poisoned</wc-fetch> for 48 hours.

If the hinges are noticed and then disassembled, requiring 1 minute and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch> for each hinge, the trap can't trigger. A failed check results in no progress at the task, but if the check fails by 5 or more, the trap goes off explosively, blowing the lid open.

##### Treasure

The back pair of pews have 4,000 sp each hidden therein, the next pair have 3,000 ep each, and the pair closest to the trapped pews have 2,000 gp each.

##### Altar

The centerpiece of the chapel is a block of strange material that glows with an inner light of opalescent blue. (If the altar is specifically targeted by a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect evil and good</wc-fetch> spell, it registers very faintly as a desecrated object.) If the altar is touched by living matter, a <wc-fetch type="spell">lightning bolt</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 15) will streak down the center aisle. After this bolt comes forth, the altar turns a fiery blue-red, and if it thereafter is touched by any object it will explode as a <wc-fetch type="spell">fireball</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 15).

##### Archway

Just as in other locations around the tomb, the mists that obscure the archway can't be penetrated with any sort of vision or magic. (If a character moves close to the archway and asks about it, explain that none of the stones of the arch glow.) The skeleton, of course, misleads the party, for any character passing through the portal will enter a 10-foot-by-10-foot room where their sex and alignment are reversed by a powerful magic. Exiting the room and re-entering the archway will restore original alignment, but also deals 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) psychic damage. Going back a third time will reverse sex again, but the individual will be teleported in the manner of the archway in **area 10**. Only a <wc-fetch type="spell">wish</wc-fetch> spell will restore both alignment and sex. If alignment is restored by entering the orange portal, a <wc-fetch type="spell">remove curse</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="spell">greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell will then restore original sex.

##### Wall Slot

A character who inspects the eastern wall directly opposite the archway and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check finds a small slot with the letter O faintly traced above it. This is the location of a moving stone block described below. The block can't be magically detected, nor will it open by physical or magical means other than the method given in **area 15**.

#### 15. Stone Gate

As shown on the map, the stone that forms part of the eastern wall of the chapel is 2 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 10 feet thick in a wedge shape. It is impregnated with strong antimagic that prevents its detection or removal or its change to another form or substance. The wall slot (see above) is of sufficient size to accept a coin or a disc-shaped gem. It is also just right for the insertion of a magic ring of any sort. Only such an item will trigger the mechanism, which causes the block to sink slowly into the floor so as to allow entry into the passage beyond. The object deposited into the slot is forever lost, as the sinking stone crushes all to pieces. The gate opens easily from the other (east) side, and no special item is required to trigger its opening from that side.

##### Doors and Pits

Beyond the gate stone, the corridor widens to 10 feet and turns southward where steps lead down steeply to a corridor that goes west. Each of the three doors in the corridor opens easily if any pushing force is applied to it, and a creature that does so stumbles into the **area pit** on the other side unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If a door isn't violently pushed against, it can be opened safely by pulling it inward, and the party will have standard chances of falling in when the characters leading the way step on the pit cover.

By the time the westernmost door and pit have been reached, the characters will certainly expect the pit, and will be likely to bypass and ignore it. This carelessness would prevent them from examining the pit from within. On the south wall of the pit is a wooden door painted to look like stone, which is easily discovered by anyone who looks at this wall while inside the pit or who makes a tactile investigation of the wall from outside the pit.

##### Crawl Space

Beyond the painted door is a narrow passage that emerges at the top of a short flight of stairs leading down.

#### 16. Locked Oaken Door

> The thick wooden door ahead of you is heavily bound with iron bands, and there are several locks keeping it shut.

![Oak Door](adventure/TftYP/ToHOak-Door.jpg)

##### Aura

The door is found to radiate an aura of abjuration magic if a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell is cast upon it.

##### Sounds from Beyond

A character who listens with an ear to the door will hear far-off music and happy singing, obviously coming from the other side of the door.

No amount of forcing or spells will open the door. The only way to continue northward is to use a <wc-fetch type="spell">disintegrate</wc-fetch> spell on the door or physically destroy it (it has 100 hit points).

If the characters destroy the door, read:

> As the door falls away, you can hear sounds of confusion and distress coming from the north. A faint glow, like that of a small flame, shines in the distance. The walls of the passage ahead of you are of smooth white alabaster, and the floor is highly polished, smoke-gray marble.

The destruction of the door triggered a <wc-fetch type="spell">minor illusion</wc-fetch> spell that produced the noises of distress, which are designed to lure the characters onward.

The tunnel floor is a counterweighted beam. Its overbalancing point is the third square north of the door. When one or more characters move there, the floor beyond the door will begin to tilt downward, with the north end slowly sinking. If this occurs, quickly state how the floor is beginning to slant, and have the characters roll initiative. On initiative count 10, all characters north of the door fall <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch> and slide 10 feet to the north.

A character can attempt to scramble back up the ramp to the south by making a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) check, or two successful checks if using the <wc-fetch type="action">Dash</wc-fetch> action. Those who succeed still slide 10 feet north on initiative count 10 in each round, but they can also climb upward according to the normal rules for doing so. A character whose check fails by 5 or more slides an extra 5 feet to the north. Those who slide to the fourth square north of the door take 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) fire damage, then 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) fire damage in the fifth square. Characters who slide farther than that are plunged into a pit of molten lava which will absolutely snuff them out.

#### 17. Magical Secret Door

This entrance to the remainder of the tomb is on the wall adjoining the stairway that leads down. It can be found by mundane means, requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check, but nothing will enable it to be opened until either the area is viewed through a <wc-fetch type="item">gem of seeing</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="spell">true seeing</wc-fetch> spell is cast, or a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell is used to determine the door's magic aura (abjuration).

After the magic of the door is identified, a <wc-fetch type="spell">dispel magic</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="spell">remove curse</wc-fetch> spell is needed to remove the guard that prevents the door from being opened. Once this is accomplished, the secret door can be opened easily from either side.

#### 18. Corridor Protected by Fear Gas

If the characters travel south from the secret door, they reach a landing at the top of a stairway.

> Stairs descend to the west. The corridor that extends past the bottom of the steps is slightly cloudy.

The corridor is filled with fear gas. Unless characters announce they are holding their breath before entering its 40-foot length, they will breathe in the gas. A creature exposed to the gas must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become <wc-fetch type="condition">frightened</wc-fetch> for 1 minute.

A creature <wc-fetch type="condition">frightened</wc-fetch> in this way must take the <wc-fetch type="action">Dash</wc-fetch> action on each of its turns to retrace its steps, moving away from this area of the tomb by the safest route possible. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. Once the effect ends, the creature is immune to the gas for 1 hour.

Beyond the first 10 feet, the gas becomes thicker, and it irritates the eyes. The area is lightly obscured, so it requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check to notice the south door that leads into **area 18A**. Once that door is opened, the gas dissipates.

#### 18A. False Crypt

> Beyond the door, a stairway leads down. The way is blocked by thick webbing that fills the area from steps to ceiling.

The steps down to the chamber at the end are filled with web (as <wc-fetch type="spell">web</wc-fetch>) which can only be removed by magical fire (a <wc-fetch type="spell">burning hands</wc-fetch> spell, a <wc-fetch type="item">flame tongue</wc-fetch> sword, or the like). Any character trying to break through them will become hopelessly entangled and can't get loose unless the webs are burned away or the character is freed by a <wc-fetch type="spell">wish</wc-fetch> spell.

If the characters clear away the webs and descend to the foot of the stairway, read:

> Lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs is an iron mace inlaid with silver. South of this location is a modest-sized room. What you can see of it is filled with rotting and decayed furnishings.

The mace will begin to glow with a bright golden light when it is picked up by any character. (Whenever this weapon is swung at the occupant of this chamber, it will hit.)

Characters who enter the room will see a solid gold couch along the back wall. A skeletal figure that resembles a lich, wearing a crown on its head, slowly rises from the couch (and throws up its hands in apparent fear if the mace is being carried). A booming voice seeming to emanate from the whole of the chamber will demand: "Who dares to disturb the rest of Acererak? It is your death which you have found!"

##### Creature

The false crypt is the home of a false lich that is actually a magically prepared greater zombie. Between strikes the creature will gesture with its hands as if readying a spell. If it is struck by the golden mace it will make a roaring bellow (produced by a <wc-fetch type="spell">magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell), and the weapon will obviously stagger it (roll dice and shake your head ruefully) every time the mace is used. The third time it is struck by the glowing mace, the false lich will instantly wither and disappear in a puff of dust, and the mace will shatter.

If the characters investigate the room's contents, they can see a jade coffer, the dead monster's fallen crown, and a fine leather bag (its condition is a give-away-it isn't rotten) all within easy reach. The furnishings and decorations are of no value.

##### Collapse

At the moment when the false lich disappears, the room will start to shake and stones will begin to come down from the ceiling. Obviously the place is beginning to collapse, but take your time detailing the increasing rumblings, tremors, grinding noises, falling hunks of ceiling, and so forth to the players.

Now begin counting slowly to 10, and it is odds on that there will be a stampede up the stairs to get away! A <wc-fetch type="spell">programmed illusion</wc-fetch> spell affecting the entire false crypt will produce the full effects of a cave-in, complete with tactile components. Actual dust will billow up the stairs, while bits of stone begin to fall in the east-west tunnel and then in the north-south tunnel and the stairs reached from the pit. If the party runs out, ask them if they thought it was too hard a dungeon.

##### Treasure

The jade coffer is worth 5,000 gp and contains six <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>. The crown is set with gems and worth 25,000 gp. (The gold that makes up the couch is worth 50,000 gp, but it can't be moved or damaged.) The small sack holds 278 pp, twenty-nine gems worth 10 gp each, seven <wc-fetch type="item">spell scroll</wc-fetch> (all of 1st and 2nd-level wizard spells), and a map showing a location several hundred miles away that supposedly has a rich treasure (it is a fake, naturally).

##### False Ending

If this outcome doesn't make the players suspicious enough to take another run through to check things out, put the adventure away for use when you have a different group (or the same ones) inquiring about one of the references in the "Legend of the Tomb." Note that something so simple as a <wc-fetch type="spell">commune</wc-fetch> spell will reveal that the demilich has not been destroyed.

#### 19. Laboratory and Mummy Preparation Room

Although there is only one item of eventual use within this totally plain and cluttered place, the volume of items within it is calculated to waste time for the players. Describe the features of the room as the characters investigate.

All of the walls are lined with shelves, and upon these are old jars filled with dust and impotent ingredients of all sorts. There is a large desk and stool, two workbenches, and two mummy preparation tables. Clay pots and urns on these tables and the floor obviously once contained unguents, ointments, oils, perfumes, and the like. Linen wrappings are in rolls or strewn about. Dried herbs of unidentifiable nature, bones, skulls and the like litter the workbenches.

##### Vats

In the south part of the room are three vats of about 7 feet in diameter and 4 feet in depth that contain murky liquids. The vats are affixed to the floor and too heavy to move. The western one holds only dirty water.

The middle vat contains a slow-acting acid which will deal 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) acid damage on the round after a creature's flesh comes into substantial contact with it (by immersing an arm, being splashed on, and so forth)-minor contact (dipping a finger) will cause only a mild itch. At the bottom of this vat is one-half of a golden key.

The eastern vat contains a grayish substance that is actually an ochre jelly that sits atop the other half of the golden key.

##### Treasure

The key parts are magical and will not be harmed by anything. If the parts are joined together they form one solid key, hereafter called the First Key. Because the acid will harm even magic weapons, the players will have to figure some way to neutralize or drain off the contents of the second vat to acquire the key, as a reach-in-and-grope-for-it technique has only a 1 percent cumulative chance per round of being successful.

#### 20. Huge Pit Filled with Spikes

If the characters proceed through the laboratory, they come upon a descending staircase that ends at a corridor heading east. Assuming they can see what lies ahead of them, read:

> A ten-foot-deep, empty pit completely fills the passageway and extends so far as to make jumping across it impossible for most creatures.

![Spiked Pit](adventure/TftYP/ToHSpiked-Pit.jpg)

##### Spike Trap

The characters might deduce that the pit can be crossed by climbing down and walking across the bottom, then climbing up the other side. Simple! Wrong—any footstep upon the last 5 feet (east portion) of the pit presses a pressure plate, causing a volley of spikes to discharge upward. If the plate is triggered, each person in the pit or leaning over its edge is likely to be struck by the spikes, which have a **+11** bonus to hit and deal 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) piercing damage. New spikes will come up out of the floor every time if the plate is pressed more than once.

A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check discovers the pressure plate. It can then be wedged shut by a character who is adjacent to the plate and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check while using <wc-fetch type="item">thieves' tools</wc-fetch>. On a failed check, it's apparent that the block didn't work—unless the check fails by 5 or more, in which case the job seems solid but fails when someone walks on the plate.

#### 21. The Agitated Chamber

The secret door to this place can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check.

> The room appears to be filled with funerary offerings and furniture. There are four rotting sofas, a couple of throne-like chairs, and a jumble of stands, small tables, and vases and urns that are dented, chipped, and broken. Only the rather plain tapestries hanging on the east and west walls appear to have been spared a rough looting. Amid the general havoc are scattered several trunks and a larger number of coffers.

##### Heaving Floor

The weight of the characters upon the balanced floor of this room sets a mechanism into motion. Each round they remain in the place, on initiative count 0, roll a die. An odd-numbered result means that the floor of the room will jump and buck up and down violently. When the floor does so, each creature in the room must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch> and take 1 bludgeoning damage from abrasions and contusions.

##### Tapestries

The wall hangings, which depict weed-grown rocks and green and golden tan scenes of undersea life, are special, antimagic-treated creations made of <wc-fetch type="trap">green slime</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type="trap">brown mold</wc-fetch> (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

If either tapestry is torn down, it instantly turns into <wc-fetch type="trap">green slime</wc-fetch> and covers a 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide area of floor when it falls. Note that the tapestries can be handled normally without risk, just not yanked so as to tear them (and they are well affixed at the top); if any character is holding one when the room becomes agitated, however, it is <wc-roll chance>75 percent</wc-roll> probable that the jerking motion will tear the thing.

If these hangings are subjected to burning, they instantly turn to <wc-fetch type="trap">brown mold</wc-fetch> that covers the same area.

The secret door behind the tapestry on the west wall requires the tapestry to be removed, but thereafter can be found as easily as the entry door.

##### Treasure

The trunks are empty, but the smaller coffers hold various items. Roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll> each time one is opened. On a roll of 1–3, the coffer contains <wc-roll>1d3</wc-roll> poisonous snake. On a roll of 4–5, <wc-roll>8d10</wc-roll> pp are found. On a roll of 6, the coffer holds <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> gems (worth 10 gp each).

#### 22. The Cavern of Gold and Silver Mists

> A thick silver mist, shot through with delicate streamers of gold, partially blocks your view of the area that lies ahead.

The mists make the entire area heavily obscured. A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect evil and good</wc-fetch> spell cast in the area, or a paladin's use of Divine Sense, indicates that this is a consecrated place.

Any creature that steps into the mist must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them. This effect lasts until the character can breathe the clean air above ground under the warm sun.

##### Creature

At the center of the cavern is a small grotto in which dwells the fey being Siren. As a private joke, Acererak placed her in this cavern under an enchantment. She must be asked to come out of the chamber in order to break the spell, and she can give no clues as to the nature of her durance. If the characters come close enough, they can see that two sacks, a large one and a small one, are lying on the floor next to her.

Siren will converse in a friendly fashion, asking how characters are and if they find the going hard in the tomb. Because of the enchantment, she will answer any direct questions with an evasive reply: "I cannot say," "That is unknown to me," "Possibly," and so forth unless she is freed. She knows nothing of the tomb in any event.

If the characters ask her to come with them and are kind, she will do so and stay with them through the rest of the adventure.

##### Treasure

Both of Siren's sacks contain treasure, but it isn't possible to acquire more than one of them—and in fact both of the sacks will disappear if she is asked to accompany the party. If a character touches one of the sacks before she is asked to come along, she and the other sack immediately disappear.

The large sack contains 50 pieces each of copper, silver, electrum, gold and platinum. It appears to be a normal sack, but it has a magical aura if it is checked, for it is a <wc-fetch type="item">bag of holding</wc-fetch>.

To determine the contents of the small sack, roll a <wc-roll>d10</wc-roll>:

| <span class="text-center block"><wc-roll>d10</wc-roll></span> | Contents |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1–2</span> | Filled with wool |
| <span class="text-center block">3–4</span> | Five pieces of jewelry |
| <span class="text-center block">5–6</span> | <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> <wc-fetch type="item">potion of greater healing</wc-fetch> |
| <span class="text-center block">7</span> | <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> <wc-fetch type="item">spell scroll</wc-fetch>, each of a wizard spell of 5th level or lower (DM's choice) |
| <span class="text-center block">8</span> | <wc-roll>4d12</wc-roll> gems (worth 100 gp each) |
| <span class="text-center block">9</span> | <wc-fetch type="item">Bracers of defense</wc-fetch> |
| <span class="text-center block">10</span> | <wc-fetch type="item">Ring of feather falling</wc-fetch> |

It isn't possible to gain both the large and the small sacks by any means. If a character or characters state they will grab them simultaneously, roll dice to see which sack is touched a fraction of a second sooner. The other disappears—along with Siren—forever.

#### 23. False/True Door

When the party opens the door that promises to offer access to the north, it is probable that they will believe it to be nothing more than a false door, but the seemingly blank wall of solid stone behind the false door hides a secret door, which can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check.

##### Secret Trapdoor

On the other side of the secret door is a secret trapdoor in the floor of the corridor, requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check to find.

The trapdoor opens onto a steep flight of narrow stairs that spiral down to a 5-foot-wide tunnel which emerges at **area 24**.

#### 23A. Knockout Corridor

If the characters don't find the tunnel or choose not to follow it, they move through a door that leads east and then come upon a set of double doors in the north wall. When the doors to the north are opened, sleep gas billows forth from the other side. Each creature in the eastwest passage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall <wc-fetch type="condition">unconscious</wc-fetch> for <wc-roll>2d4 × 10</wc-roll> minutes.

##### Rolling Stone

Every 10 minutes after the gas is released, roll a <wc-roll>d4</wc-roll>. On a roll of 4, a stone juggernaut (rather like a steam roller) comes out of the 20-foot square room to the north and rolls <wc-roll>1d6 × 10</wc-roll> feet south, then west. Everything it rolls over is squashed to a pulp. There is no appeal.

#### 24. Adamantine Door

The tunnel from the south emerges into a corridor that then heads east. The door at the end is a great block of adamantine. It has permanent antimagic effects on it, and there is no magical or physical way of forcing entry.

There are three slots in the door at about waist height. If sword blades are shoved simultaneously into all the slots, the 1-foot-thick door will swing open. Five rounds later, the door slams shut. There is no way of opening it from the west side.

#### 25. Pillared Throne Room

> You look upon an enormous chamber colored in pastels. A forest of massive, many-hued columns support the ceiling.

##### Aura

Each of the 3-foot-diameter pillars radiates an aura of transmutation magic when such is detected for.

##### Upwardly Mobile

Any character who touches a pillar with or without intent will uncontrollably float upward (as if affected by a <wc-fetch type="spell">levitate</wc-fetch> spell), then bounce gently around on the ceiling, 30 feet above, just as a helium balloon. To stop this effect, a <wc-fetch type="spell">dispel magic</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="spell">remove curse</wc-fetch> spell must be placed upon each such individual.

There seems to be a gentle breeze in the room, for any character floating among the many-hued columns will begin drifting toward the northwest or northeast corner of the room. From the entry an observant character with a suitable light source will be able to observe part of the dais on the south wall and the door at **area 27**.

##### Northwest Devil Face

About 24 feet above the floor in the northwest corner, on the north wall, is a mosaic relief sculpture of a green devil's face which appears to be exactly the same as that first encountered in the entrance hall to the tomb (**area 3**). Any creature that comes within 3 feet of its gaping mouth will be sucked in and instantly teleported, to be "spat out" nude at **area 6**, while all non-living matter in the character's possession goes to **area 33**.

##### Northeast Devil Face

The sculpture in the northeast corner is identical in size and placement to the one in the other corner, but it is tinged with a bluish color over the green. Any character that enters the mouth opening of this devil face is teleported to **area 27A**.

##### Charred Remains

Strewn near the southeast corner is a heap of charred bones and skulls, plus the crisped and blackened remains of clothing and gear, arms and armor—a thoroughly awful and frightening sight. A character who comes close enough to examine the remains will find a huge, glowing orange gem at the center of the destruction.

##### Cursed Gem

The gem can be easily claimed. Casting a <wc-fetch type="spell">detect evil and good</wc-fetch> reveals it to be a desecrated object. On a casting of <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch>, the gem gives off a strong aura of conjuration—so strong that the detecting character will get the vague feeling that the <wc-fetch type="spell">wish</wc-fetch> spell is involved in the gem's magic.

The gem is actually a cursed magic item. If any character touches it and attempts to cast a <wc-fetch type="spell">wish</wc-fetch> spell using it, a reversed or distorted version of the wish's fulfillment will bring harm to that character and all named in the wish.

Then, immediately after the evil <wc-fetch type="spell">wish</wc-fetch> spell has transpired, the gem begins to pulse with reddish lights, growing progressively stronger, brighter and hotter. Roll initiative. On initiative count 1, the stone explodes, absolutely killing any character within a 15-foot radius in a wave of searing radiation and flames. The gem remains as a noisome mass of stinking purplish mold which bubbles and chuckles. In one week the mass will again re-form as a glowing orange gem.

![Throne](adventure/TftYP/ToHThrone.jpg)

##### Ebony Dais and Silver Throne

When the characters come close enough to see the details on the dais, read:

> Contrasting with the pastel colors of the floor and pillars of the hall is the stark blackness of the huge dais on the south wall, atop which sits an obsidian throne inlaid with silver and ivory skulls. Upon the throne rest a crown made of gold and a scepter made of electrum, with a gold knob on one end and a silver cap on the other.

##### Aura

The crown and both ends of the scepter prove to be magical if such is detected for. In addition, the crown and the gold knob of the scepter radiate an aura of abjuration magic, and the silver end of the scepter has an aura of necromancy magic.

##### Crown and Scepter

The crown negates the pillars' levitation effect for anyone who dons it and enables the wearer to see within the hall as if in normal daylight—but outside this place the wearer is <wc-fetch type="condition">blinded</wc-fetch>. As soon as a creature puts on the crown, the wearer knows that the crown can be removed only by touching the scepter to it, but doesn't find out the exact procedure.

If the golden knob is touched to the crown, the wearer can remove the headgear. If the silver end of the scepter is touched to the crown, the wearer is instantly snuffed out, turning to a fetid powder that can't be brought back to life no matter what (<wc-fetch type="spell">wish</wc-fetch> spells notwithstanding).

##### Treasure

Each of these items is obviously valuable (25,000 gp for the crown, 12,500 gp for the scepter), but both are cursed. If they are removed from the tomb, the possessor of either item will be visited by a vrock sent to reclaim the item and return it to the throne room—or by two such demons if a single character has both items.

##### Throne Passage

A character who examines the throne and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check discovers a small replica of the crown inlaid in silver on the lower front panel of the seat. If the silver end of the scepter is applied to this inlay, the throne sinks down and reveals a 5-foot-wide passageway that leads south.

#### 26. Small Room with a Door of Electric Blue

The two doors near the northern corners of the throne room look the same. When a character comes within 10 feet of either one, it can be seen that the door actually shimmers with a faint blue light. When the door is touched, this glimmering grows bright. A brass pull beckons to be used, and the door will open easily. Inside the western room there is nothing but dust. The eastern room is another matter.

If the eastern door is opened, the characters will see a low stone table upon which rests a wooden sarcophagus. Various broken and looted urns and coffers are scattered about. Inside the sarcophagus are the parts of a mummy (not an undead, exactly, for at this time it is the mummified remains of a human) with wrappings partially undone and tattered.

##### Treasure

A huge amethyst, worth 5,000 gp, is barely visible between the wrappings that cover the mummy's head. A character who examines the mummy and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check can discover it in one of the eye sockets.

##### Creature

The gem has an evil magic placed upon it, and if it is removed from the mummy, the remains become a true mummy lord that has no spells and no legendary actions (defeating it awards half XP). Magic upon the mummy lord's wrappings makes them nonflammable, and the creature wears a <wc-fetch type="item">ring of fire resistance</wc-fetch>.

#### 27. The Portal of Scintillating Violet

The door in the center of the north wall of the throne room appears to lead to another small room. Like the two near the corners, this one gives off a faint glow when viewed from 10 feet away, though this light is of a lilac color.

When this door is touched, the light changes to a bright and coruscating purple with tinges of sickly green. If a character opens the door, read:

> You see a bare chamber, with a small door on the north wall, and pairs of swords crossed behind shields hung upon the walls. There are three such sets on each of the walls to either hand, and two sets on the north wall, one flanking each side of the door.

##### Creatures

If the threshold of the chamber is crossed by any creature, one set of swords will fly off the wall and attack the individual so doing. The two flying sword will both attack, and the shield ({creature flying shield|tftyp|statistics} as the swords, but no attacks) will interpose itself to take hits meant for the swords. This trio will attack until they are destroyed or the one who violated their area is dead. Surviving weapons and shields return to their former positions after the offender is hacked to pieces.

Worse still, if the threshold is crossed a second time, another pair of blades and a shield will attack, and each set gains a cumulative +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as 1 hit point more than the previous set.

Only the following spells will affect these items: <wc-fetch type="spell">telekinesis</wc-fetch> sends all three items of a set back to their original position; <wc-fetch type="spell">heat metal</wc-fetch> will cause one item to fall to pieces; <wc-fetch type="spell">disintegrate</wc-fetch> will destroy all items of a set; <wc-fetch type="spell">magic weapon</wc-fetch> will cause a sword to become a plain iron weapon.

#### 27A. Chamber of Hopelessness

Any creature unfortunate enough to be teleported here from **area 25** is doomed, for its fate is clearly stated in glowing letters magically written on the north wall of the place. If someone arrives here, read:

> "You who dared to violate my tomb now pay the price. Stay here and die slowly of starvation, or open and enter the door to the south, where certain but quick death awaits.
> 
> "Whichever you choose, know that I, Acererak the Eternal, watch and scoff at your puny efforts and enjoy your death throes."

##### Fountain

A small stream of water spills from a wall outlet into a basin and drains away through side holes, so there is always plenty to drink. (It is impossible to flood the place, for there are hundreds of small drain holes in the walls and floor.)

##### Treasure

There are numerous skeletons here, rotting equipment, and <wc-roll>30d10</wc-roll> each of sp, ep, gp, and pp hurled about. Searching through the remains will yield <wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll> gems (worth 10 gp each), a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of diminution</wc-fetch>, and a <wc-fetch type="item">+1 flail</wc-fetch>.

##### Swords and Shields

If the door to the south is opened from this side, all the swords and shields in **area 27** swoop from the walls to attack, but they cease as soon as the door opener retreats into the chamber to the north.

#### 28. The Wondrous Foyer

The narrow passage behind the throne leads to a 10-foot-wide landing and a series of steps which become wider to the south as they ascend. When a character reaches the landing and is able to see the steps, read:

> The walls of the area ahead are untarnished and gleaming copper panels set between rare woods inlaid with ivory. The ceiling is silver, formed so as to reflect and amplify light brought into the place. The chamber widens to the south, where a set of gently sloping steps leads upward. The six steps, from nearest to farthest, are made of onyx, pink marble, lapis, black marble, yellow serpentine, and malachite.

Upon the black marble step is a large, cylindrical key of bronze, hereafter called the Second Key, for all to behold. It has an <wc-fetch type="spell">antipathy/sympathy</wc-fetch> spell cast upon it (save DC 17) that repels humanoids (the antipathy effect). At the head of the steps are a pair of huge doors.

#### 29. The Valves of Mithral

The doors at the top of the stairs are 14 feet wide and 28 feet tall. They are made of solid mithral, 3 feet thick, and impregnated with great magics in order to make them absolutely spell and magic-proof.

##### Keyhole

Where these valves meet, at about waist height, is a cup-like depression, a hemispherical concavity with a central hole. The hole appears to fit the Second Key, but if it is inserted, the character so doing will take 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) lightning damage. Anyone so foolish as to insert the First Key (from **area 19**) will take double that amount of damage.

##### True Key

The real key to these great gates is the scepter from **area 25**. If the gold knob is inserted into the depression, the mithral doors will swing silently open. If the silver end of the scepter is touched to the hemispherical cup the holder of the instrument will be teleported instantly to be spat out of the devil's mouth at **area 6**, nude, while all non-living materials with the individual go to **area 33**, and the crown and the scepter reappear on the throne.

##### Blood Trap

If the door is attacked by force it will not budge, but if it is scratched or nicked it will turn red in that spot, and if it is cut by a sharp weapon it will begin to gush forth blood—the blood of all those who have died within the tomb! The red flow will cascade down the steps and fill the area to the top of the southernmost step in 6 rounds, and each round thereafter it will rise higher and encompass one more step. If unchecked, the flow of blood will fill the foyer to the ceiling in 20 rounds.

Fire of any sort, magical or otherwise, turns the blood to a poison gas, which is fatal, and all characters in the foyer area are dead, with no saving throw, while any in the 5-foot-wide passage to the throne room are slain unless they succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

Casting one or more <wc-fetch type="spell">cure wounds</wc-fetch> spells on the door in any combination that expends four spell slots (such as four 1st-level castings, two 2nd-level, or one 4th-level) will stanch the flow of blood, as will a <wc-fetch type="spell">heal</wc-fetch> spell. If other magic is used against the blood, only the following spells will have any effect:

- <wc-fetch type="spell">Cone of cold</wc-fetch> freezes the blood and halts the flow for 3 rounds.
- <wc-fetch type="spell">Create or destroy water</wc-fetch> turns the blood to water.
- <wc-fetch type="spell">Disintegrate</wc-fetch> destroys all the blood.
- <wc-fetch type="spell">Levitate</wc-fetch> coagulates the blood and causes it to rise up as a Huge red ochre jelly.
- <wc-fetch type="spell">Polymorph</wc-fetch> changes the blood into seven wight, which attack immediately.
- <wc-fetch type="spell">Purify food and drink</wc-fetch> turns all the blood to poison gas. A character caught in the gas must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become <wc-fetch type="condition">poisoned</wc-fetch> for 48 hours.
- <wc-fetch type="spell">Raise dead</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type="spell">resurrection</wc-fetch> destroys all the blood and causes a shade to appear on the top stair. The shade blesses the characters so that they benefit as if they had just finished a long rest.

#### 30. False Treasure Room

> This imposing chamber has a silvered ceiling, just as the foyer has, so it is brightly illuminated by reflected light. The walls are of ivory with gold inlaid. The floor is polished agate. In each corner stands a statue of black iron, easily nine feet tall. That to the northeast stands with a saw-toothed two-handed sword raised to strike; that to the northwest a huge, spike-ended mace; to the southeast the sculpture holds a wickedly spiked morning star, and the one in the southwest has a voulge.
> 
> Near the center of the room is a large bronze urn filigreed in gold. A thin stream of smoke issues from a tiny vent in its brass stopper. On the southern wall stands a granite sarcophagus that appears to be damaged. Flanking the sarcophagus are two large iron chests.

The room is lined with lead and has antimagic properties, so no spells will work within the room, and no magical properties of items of any sort will properly function except those that detect an aura of magic or a place of desecration.

##### Statues

Each statue has a magical aura, but they are merely hunks of metal; they do nothing. Each registers to the casting of <wc-fetch type="spell">detect evil and good</wc-fetch> as a desecrated object, and the visage of each of these iron statues is most fearsome and terrifying.

Moving a statue can be done, but it requires a combined Strength of 48. Moving the statue in the northwest corner reveals a ring pull in the western wall which will raise a small plug of stone and enable the party to enter a small chute which takes them into the corridor that goes west.

##### Bronze Urn

A character who examines the urn can use an action to pry loose the stopper. If the stopper is removed, an efreeti will come forth. If the urn has been battered, knocked about, shaken, overturned, or otherwise roughly handled, the creature will be in a fury and will attack. If not, it will grant three wishes for the party and then depart.

##### Sarcophagus

Examining the lid of the sarcophagus reveals that glyphs spelling "ACERERAK" are inset on it in platinum. (The metal, worth 100 pp in total, can be pried out.) The end of the thing nearest the wall is stove in and shattered. Inside can be seen bits of a wooden inner shell, a few bones, destroyed jewelry (the stones pried out), torn bits of robes and windings, dust, and a broken <wc-fetch type="item">staff of the magi</wc-fetch> (evident from the runes upon it). A shattered skull will roll out if the contents are moved around. (Why, the demilich has long been destroyed, but his magical traps somehow survived!)

##### Iron Chests

Each of these massive boxes is embedded into the stone. Neither can possibly be moved, and both show marks of prying, battering, and similar treatment. Each chest is triple-locked, and each lock contains a <wc-fetch type="trap">poison needle</wc-fetch> trap (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If the trap is triggered by a failed check, it deals 1 piercing damage and delivers a dose of <wc-fetch type="item">purple worm poison</wc-fetch> (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

##### Treasure

Both chests have treasure, the true nature of which doesn't become apparent until the spoils are moved at least 13 miles away from the tomb.

The eastern chest holds 10,000 gems, which will initially appear to be of not less than 50 gp value each. Each is actually a 1 gp piece of quartz. The other chest contains 10,000 copper pieces magicked to appear as platinum when they are first discovered.

#### 31. One-Way Doors

Characters who traverse the east-west corridor have no chance of discovering the north-south route that adjoins it. The two doors to the north are magical, such that they don't exist except for characters who approach and open them from the north.

##### Phasing Pit

The **area covered pit** depicted on the map doesn't exist until someone opens either of the one-way doors or opens the door in the corridor while traveling east to west. When one of those events occurs, the covered pit comes into phase where shown. This pit is otherwise exactly the same as others in the place.

#### 32. Secret Door

The portal to the south can't be detected by any magical means, but a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check enables a character to notice that the wall at this location has a small opening that is metal-lined—obviously a keyhole!

Following this discovery, any attempt to force the door open by physical or magical means will be useless. But if the _First Key_ (from **area 19**) is inserted in the hole and then removed, the door will sink into the floor, revealing itself to be a stone-sheathed adamantine slab of tremendous thickness. There can be no real doubt that the end of the adventure—one way or another—is near.

#### 33. The Crypt of Acererak the Demilich

> Beyond the door is a smallish, rectangular chamber with a ceiling that extends twenty-five feet overhead. There is a small depression a few inches deep and about two feet square in the center of the floor.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) check enables a character to discover a small hole in the middle of this depression—another keyhole!

If the _First Key_ is inserted herein, the key explodes, and the individual doing so takes 17 (<wc-roll>5d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage.

The _Second Key_ (from **area 28**) will fit within the hole, and nothing untoward will occur. In fact, nothing whatsoever will happen until it is turned three times to the right in succession. If this is done, read:

> As you finish turning the key, the floor begins to tremble, and then abruptly it starts to rise toward the ceiling.

Roll initiative. On initiative count 10, anyone still on the southern 15 feet of the crypt floor is crushed against the roof and slain. If any characters survive, read:

> The rising of the floor in the southern part of the room reveals a mithral vault. There is a door in the center of the device, with a ring set into it.

A hard pull will open the door.

> A low, dust-covered bench is near the back wall of the vault. On and around it are an abundance of items. Resting on one end of it is a human skull.

##### Creature

The skull belongs to Acererak, the demilich who lies in wait for the characters. When they joined the halves of the _First Key_, that act called his soul back to the Material Plane, and their use of the _Second Key_ to enter the vault alerted him that he must be prepared to do battle in order to survive yet more centuries.

All that now remains of Acererak the lich are the dust of his bones. This bit is enough! If any of the treasure in the crypt is touched, the dust swirls into the air and forms a man-like shape. If this shape is ignored, it will dissipate in 3 rounds, for it can only advance and threaten, not harm. Any physical attack will give it 1 point of energy, however, and a damaging spell cast on it gives it a number of points of energy equal to the level of the spell slot expended (1 point for a cantrip). Each point of energy is equivalent to a hit point, and if 50 hit points are thus gained, the dust will form into a ghost controlled by Acererak, and this thing will attack immediately. (The dust will seem to waver and fall back if it is struck by blow or spell, as if suffering actual damage, so formation of the ghost isn't too improbable.)

If any character is so foolish as to touch the skull of the demilich, a terrible thing occurs. Acererak rises into the air upon the touch, and it slowly scans the party prior to attacking. The demilich has the Trap the Soul action and access to its lair actions, but not lair traits. It can tell which members of the party are the most powerful, and it uses Trap the Soul on them first.

There are two jewels set into the skull's eye sockets (50,000 gp rubies) and six pointed (marquis cut) diamonds set as teeth in the jaw (each diamond is worth 5,000 gp). If all these gems are filled with souls and the skull is still intact and still being opposed, it will pronounce a curse upon the remaining characters which will teleport them randomly in a 300-mile radius, each subjected to a <wc-fetch type="spell">bestow curse</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 17) that lasts until dispelled. If the curse is removed, the character must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the character must permanently decrease one ability score by 2, or two ability scores by 1 each. This secondary effect is instantaneous and can't be dispelled.

##### Treasure

Characters who survive the demilich's wrath can claim any loot they can carry. Inside the vault are these items:

- All items possessed by characters who were teleported nude
- Ninety-seven small gems worth 10 gp each
- Three huge gems—a 10,000 gp peridot, a 50,000 gp emerald, and a 100,000 gp black opal
- Four magic weapons—a defender, a sword of vengeance, a berserker axe, and a spear of backbiting

In addition, the hoard contains several magic items of your choosing (except that none can be of legendary rarity), including:

- Twelve potions
- Six <wc-fetch type="item">spell scroll</wc-fetch>, each of a wizard spell of 5th level or lower
- One magic ring, one magic rod, one magic staff, and three wondrous items

This ends the expedition to the Tomb of Horrors. We hope you and your players have found it exciting, challenging, and rewarding.
