The grove level and the fortress level connect through the shaft that leads from **area 41** to 42. The following locations are identified on the map.

### Maps

## 42. Central Garden

> Luminescent fungus, shedding violet light, clings to the walls and ceiling of this wide cavern. The air is damp, chilly, and redolent with the odors of loam and decay. A layer of earth, mixed with rotting vegetation and the remains of cave animals, covers the floor. Several varieties of mushrooms and fungi grow on the detritus, as well as a few saplings.

### Creatures

Two robed skeleton (AC 12) serve Belak by tending a fungus garden, using shovels and a rusted wheelbarrow to turn the soil and spread compost. In addition, two mature twig blight are rooted in the garden. The twig blights ambush intruders that aren't goblinoids, and the skeletons attack (with shovels, 1d6 bludgeoning damage) anything that the twig blights target.

### Development

The creatures in **area 43** investigate any disturbance in the garden after 3 rounds.

## 43. The Great Hunter's Abode

> The floor of this rough cavern is stained and smells of blood and animal musk. Light from glowing fungus reveals the eastern niche, which holds a pallet of matted furs, a wide wooden board on which a variety of weapons are affixed, and a great cloak of patchy black fur hung on a slender pole. To the edge of the niche are two large nests made of hair, dry fungus, and refuse.

![Balsag](adventure/TftYP/TSCBalsag.jpg)

### Creature

Balsag the bugbear and his two giant rat "hounds," named Grip and Fang, reside in a natural stone chamber when they're not hunting (25 percent chance of being absent when characters arrive). The bugbear wears a crown of antlers on his head to enhance his frightening appearance. Balsag considers all non-Durbuluk creatures to be potential prey, so he attacks any he meets, roaring in Goblin,

> ### Balsag
> 
> "Get ready to meet the cook pot!"

### Underdark Access

In the dark of the northern cavern section, a crude tunnel leads away, angling west and downward. The tunnel is like the one in **area 23**.

### Treasure

Two spears, six javelins, one longsword, one greatsword are affixed to the weapon rack. A box hidden under one of the furs in Balsag's bedding, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice, contains 241 sp and 54 gp.

## 44. Rift

> A rift opens here, its debris-strewn floor two feet below that of the corridor. No phosphorescent fungus grows in the rift. The corridor continues past the rift, though the opening of the rift has caused it to shift 10 feet to the west. A number of two-foot-diameter holes riddle the floor of the rift. The smell of burnt earth hangs in the air.

The small holes in the floor extend as far down as any one is capable of probing.

## 45. Rift Node

> The rift widens, creating a cavern-like chamber. Small, two-foot-diameter holes riddle the node. A dim fiery glow shines out of one such hole.

### Creature

In the glowing hall rests a fire snake. Belak used magic to call the creature forth and hopes to train it to be a loyal servant before it matures.

### Treasure

Belak has already appealed to the snake's greed with a small gift. In its nest, the adventurers find two sapphires (worth 50 gp each).

## 46. Old Shrine

The stone door at the end of the corridor is closed and stuck, requiring someone to make a successful DC 15 Strength check to pull it open.

> Faded mosaic tiles still decorate parts of the wall, but most have fallen to the dust-covered floor and shattered. Situated at the center of the chamber stands a slim pedestal of rusted iron shaped like an upright dragon. In the dragon's mouth rests an empty tray.

The room once held items of importance to the old dragon cult. The remaining features are dust-covered and worthless.

## 47. Belak's Laboratory

> Two rows of dragon-carved marble columns march the length of the hall, most completely covered in luminescent fungus. The cobbled floor is cracked and stained, and on it sit many small wooden tables. The contents on the tables include mortars and pestles, small tools, bowls filled with crushed leaves, chopped fungus stalks, and other plant specimens. The many doors leading off this hall are all partly open.

Belak prepares various experimental concoctions in his laboratory and the small chambers that lead off it (see the sections below), with the fumbling aid of goblins that serve him. Any noise or disturbance in the main area draws all the monsters, although those in the northwest chamber respond most slowly.

### Investigating

The containers on the small tables in the main area hold mashed leaves, fungus, bark, and powdered roots. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies many common varieties of tree, shrub, and fungus, although all have a pronounced pallor, as if sun-starved.

### Treasure

One pile of herbs and supplies in the main chamber contains the ingredients of a <wc-fetch type="item">healer's kit</wc-fetch>. An assortment of tools and herbs can be salvaged to make up a <wc-fetch type="item">herbalism kit</wc-fetch> and a set of <wc-fetch type="item">alchemist's supplies</wc-fetch>.

### Northwest Chamber

Snores are audible from the room to the northwest, which is a rough barracks. Sixteen small pallets of matted fur cover the floor. Two pallets currently hold a sleeping goblin and two goblin commoner (like those in **area 40**).

### Southwest Chamber

The goblins use a crude mashing, straining, and casking facility to create goblin wine, which they and Belak are quite fond of. Two goblin commoner currently stand barefoot in the mashing-tun, squashing roots and fungi into pulp. A dirty straining bin stands nearby, as well as ten 2-gallon casks of the end product.

### North Central Chamber

Two goblin commoner currently repair dirty goblin armor with cord, iron needles, leather patches, and other crude implements of tailoring.

### South Central Chamber

One goblin and two goblin commoner monitor the health of a diseased giant rat, which is strapped spread-eagled onto a wooden bench. The rat suffers from horrible tumors that look woody and fruit-like. Its tumors stem from an elixir Belak created to infuse twig blight traits into giant rats.

On a stand in the corner is a fancy crystal vial (worth 5 gp) that contains the elixir. Drinking the elixir exposes the drinker to the same disease that the diseased rat might impart with its bite, except the initial saving throw DC is 15.

### Northeast Chamber

Extra weapon stores include five battered scimitars, six shortbows, and forty arrows.

### Southeast Chamber

The room stands empty, and the caved-in back wall leads to a natural rift in the earth (see **area 44**).

## 48. Garden Galleries

The two galleries that lead to the arboretums have the same characteristics. The doors to all connecting areas are closed.

> Nodules of luminescent fungus hang from the ceiling and walls and grow in clumps on the flagstone floor. The light illuminates portions of grand bas-relief carvings on the stone walls that aren't covered with the fungus. The carvings depict dragons in various stages of raining fire down upon terrified people. Soil and compost cover half the chamber's floor, which allows a variety of feeble plants to grow. A bench containing simple gardening implements stands along the west wall.

Belak is using the galleries to grow above-ground vegetation using the light of luminescent fungus.

### Creature

A bugbear gardener roams both galleries, tending the grasses for Belak. She is armed with a sickle-bladed glaive; she has a reach of 10 feet and deals 2d10+2 slashing damage with it.

### Treasure

The bugbear carries a <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>.

### Development

The neighboring arboretums (**area 49**) contain additional monsters. The closed doors and stone walls prevent sound from entering these four areas. The creatures within join the battle here at your discretion.

## 49. Arboretums

> Luminescent mist blurs the edges of this octagonal chamber. Nodules of glowing fungus dot the stone walls and ceiling, as well as the caps of toadstools and mushrooms, small polyps, puffballs, and lichen. The humid air reeks with rot.

The arboretums hold small samples of traditional Underdark ecosystems, which aren't difficult for Belak to nurture. The stone doors leading to them are unlocked.

### Southern Arboretum

A goblin and three goblin commoner gather fungus for use in **area 47**.

### Southeast Arboretum

Several growths in the chamber are scorched and dead. Fungus shrouds holes similar to those found in **area 45**, and a fire snake lurks inside one of these openings. It emerges if anyone pokes into or closely examines the holes. If the snake comes out, a character who reaches into the snake's burrow can recover two sapphires (worth 50 gp each).

### Northeast Arboretum

Three skeleton -AC 12, 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage with shovels or rakes-are at work, clearing scorched plants. One twig blight, which is hostile to the adventurers, is with them. The skeletons attack anything the twig blight attacks.

Fungus shrouds holes similar to those in **area 45**.

### Northern Arboretum

The northern room contains only its plants.

## 50. Ashardalon's Shrine

> Dragon-carved granite blocks line this chamber's walls and ceiling, though many are crumbled and broken, leaving stony debris on the floor. A huge marble statue of a rearing red dragon stands in the curve of the western wall. The eye sockets of the dragon are empty, but a red glow lingers there, providing reddish light throughout the chamber. The radiance casts an inky shadow behind the statue's wide wings. A five-foot-diameter, circular tile of dark stone is set in the floor in front of the dragon statue. Runes are carved around the circular tile's inner edge.

### Investigating

Viewed in white light, the circular tile is red. A <wc-fetch type="spell">detect magic</wc-fetch> spell can reveal that the tile and statue give off an aura of transmutation. The runes on the tile's inner edge read, in Draconic,

> "Let the sorcerous power illuminate my spirit."

If anyone speaks this sentence aloud while standing on the tile, a puff of spectral flame harmlessly envelops the speaker, granting the target advantage on Charisma checks for 24 hours. Once the tile is activated, it is dormant for 24 hours.

### Creature

A shadow hides in the gloom behind the dragon statue. It attacks only those who spot it or who attempt to investigate the circular tile or claim the treasure. The creature doesn't pursue those who flee.

### Treasure

A loose stone is in the wall behind the statue, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. Inside are 34 gp and two flasks of alchemist's fire.

## 51. Dragon Library

> Leaning and fallen stone bookshelves fill this chamber, though a clear path connects wooden doors on opposite walls. Torn and burnt pages, bindings, and scrolls form disordered piles in the corners.

### Treasure

Rooting around in the wreckage, separate successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks uncover a <wc-fetch type="item">Spell Scroll (2nd level)</wc-fetch> <wc-fetch type="spell">scorching ray</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="item">Spell Scroll (2nd level)</wc-fetch> <wc-fetch type="spell">Melf's acid arrow</wc-fetch>, and a tome of dragon lore bound in dragon scale and written in Draconic (worth 150 gp).

## 52. Underpass

> Damp and crumbled steps descend sharply.

The steps descend 15 feet. An 8-foot-high stone corridor passes about 7 feet below the northern arboretum (**area 49**), connecting the stairways on either side.

## 53. Belak's Study

The wooden door leading to Belak's study is closed and locked. The lock can be undone by someone who uses thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check.

> A layer of soil covers the floor. Rough wooden shelves, filled with a scattering of tomes and scrolls, line the north and east walls, and a rough-hewn desk stands in the center of the chamber. Fungus on the ceiling provides light, apparently in sufficient quantity to nourish several small bushes and pale saplings that grow in the soil.

### Investigating

In his study, Belak stores seasonal records of growth, precipitation, harvests, and similar notes for the surrounding lands for the last dozen years. One interesting tome titled (in Draconic) Treasures of the Fire Lords has a <wc-fetch type="spell">glyph of warding</wc-fetch> spell with an explosive runes effect on it. The glyph is on the second page, and it's triggered when someone opens to that page. Otherwise, the book is blank.

If the glyph is triggered, it erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the book. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cold doesn't damage the other works here.

### Development

If any obvious disturbance occurs here, the goblins in **area 54** set an ambush for intruders. They wait at least 10 minutes before coming to investigate.

### Treasure

Separate successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks uncover a <wc-fetch type="item">Spell Scroll (1st level)</wc-fetch> <wc-fetch type="spell">entangle</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type="item">Spell Scroll (2nd level)</wc-fetch> <wc-fetch type="spell">protection from poison</wc-fetch>, and a tome on druidic theories on the cycle of life and death (worth 150 gp). Cubbyholes in the desk hold 365 gp and four agate gems (20 gp each).

## 54. Grove Gate

> Twigs and roots are piled on the floor of this sagging chamber. The collapsed southern wall opens into a vast cavern. Luminescent fungus on the rough walls and the high roof loom over a twilight grove of sickly briars, bushes, saplings, and other woody plants. Ruined walls and hollow towers protrude from the briars.

### Creatures

Four goblin sort the specimens for Belak. They are hostile to intruders. If things go badly for them, they cry out in Goblin, saying,

> ### Goblin
> 
> "Aid us, Protector of the Twilight Grove!"

### Development

Sometimes the twig blights in **area 55** attack the goblins out of sheer malice. Thus, a call from the goblins doesn't bring all the forces of the cavern down on the characters. But if the goblins do call, four twig blight arrive from **area 55** and attack.

### Investigating

Any character who gazes into **area 55** and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the blackened top of the Gulthias Tree in the distance. If the check succeeds by 3 or more, the character also spots the twig blights creeping around in **area 55**.

## 55. Twilight Grove

> Pale, spindly briars press close, casting twisted shadows on the earth floor in the violet light.

### Briars

The most successful aboveground plants that Belak has transplanted in the Twilight Grove are the briars, though they appear sickly and pale, with blighted leaves. Other common plants and bushes are also represented, though they are equally afflicted.

The briars don't hinder Small and smaller creatures. Larger creatures must either spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved or make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw for every 10 feet moved. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 piercing damage from the briars.

A 5-foot-by-5-foot area of briars can be cleared if it takes 20 damage of any type other than psychic.

### Creatures

Ten twig blight, less any that were dispatched in **area 54**, are spread about the grove. After moving 50 feet into the cavern, the characters come upon 1d4 of the hostile creatures. Any significant noise, such as from combat or clearing the briars, also attracts 1d4-1 twig blights (minimum 0) each round.

### Development

If the characters get to **area 56** before all the twig blights have engaged, the rest of the monsters hold off their attacks. Any conflict that involves yelling in a language other than Goblin, the use of flashy magical effects, or similar noticeable elements alerts Belak in **area 56** to the approach of invaders.

## 56. The Gulthias Tree

> A walled clearing is here among the briars. The walls are about twenty feet high, which is less than half the height of the cavern's ceiling. Several varieties of plants grow around the perimeter of the clearing, including a few suspicious-looking saplings, but their importance pales before that which stands at the courtyard's center.
> 
> Beneath the fungal light grows an evil tree. Its blackened, twisted limbs reach upward, like a skeletal hand clawing its way out of the earth. Before it stand a few twig blights; a heavily armored, young human male with a shield and sword; a blonde, young human woman in a robe fit for a noble; and a middle-aged, bearded human male wearing a hooded brown robe and armed with a staff and sickle.
> 
> The younger humans have black eyes and gray skin with the texture of bark.

![Belak](adventure/TftYP/TSCBelak.jpg)

### Creatures

Belak the Outcast spends much of his time studying the Gulthias Tree, but he is well aware when the characters are approaching. He is a human druid, and he has the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): <wc-fetch type="spell">druidcraft</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">poison spray</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">shillelagh</wc-fetch>

1st level (4 slots): <wc-fetch type="spell">cure wounds</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">entangle</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">faerie fire</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">thunderwave</wc-fetch>

2nd level (3 slots): <wc-fetch type="spell">barkskin</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type="spell">flaming sphere</wc-fetch>

Standing with Belak are Sir Braford and Sharwyn Hucrele. Belak's giant frog, Kulket, lurks stealthily in the branches of the Gulthias Tree. A character who has a passive Perception score of 15 or higher or succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the frog. If combat breaks out, the frog jumps down and joins the fight in the second round. Three twig blight are here, too.

### Interaction

When the characters arrive, Belak says loudly,

> ### Belak
> 
> "Hold a moment, you know not what you do!"

If the characters engage him in conversation, he can share the following information:

> ### Belak
> 
> _What are you doing?_ "I am Belak, called the Outcast. My circle expelled me, the fools. Why? Because I dared to expand nature's reach in ways they couldn't grasp. I have found what I sought in the Gulthias Tree."

> ### Belak
> 
> _What is the Gulthias Tree?_ "It's beautiful, no? It lives, though it looks dead. In an age long past, someone staked a vampire on this very spot. The stake took root. And so grew the Gulthias Tree, reverberating with primal power for those who can tap it."

> ### Belak
> 
> _What's with the stick-monsters?_ "The twig blights grow from seeds of the tree's fruit."

> ### Belak
> 
> _What's going on with the fruit?_ "I give fruit to the goblins with orders to disperse their seeds on the surface. Deceitful beings that they are, the goblins barter the fruit, but the seeds are dispersed all the same. My plan for colonizing the surface with the children of Gulthias continues."

> ### Belak
> 
> _What did you do to the other adventurers?_ "They were the first supplicants. The Gulthias Tree has accepted them, and they are mine to control, just like the twig blights. You can't save them."

> ### Belak
> 
> _Why are you talking to us?_ "Though your remains would enrich the compost, you'll serve my needs better as supplicants. You shall retain your lives, after a fashion. Surrender and submit peacefully, or perish!"

While this interaction proceeds, Sir Braford, the three twig blights, and Belak's frog position themselves between the characters and Belak (Sharwyn stands next to Belak).

### Combat

If a fight breaks out (which will happen unless the characters actually submit to Belak), the twig blights, the frog, and Sir Braford attack the characters physically. Sir Braford uses Shatterspike to destroy his foe's weapon, if possible.

Belak casts barkskin on himself, possibly before melee occurs. He also makes early use of his wand of entangle, attempting to hold the transgressors in place. If Braford looks like he needs healing, Belak casts healing spells on him, as well. Sharwyn uses her repertoire of spells to best advantage, resorting to her dagger only in desperation.

### Development

During a battle, if any twig blights remain in **area 55**, 1d4-1 of them (minimum 0) enter this area each round.

### Targeting the Tree

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check or Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check allows a character to deduce that destroying the tree might have an effect on Sir Braford, Sharwyn, and the twig blights. If anyone attacks the Gulthias Tree, Belak and the twig blights try to kill the aggressor. If the Gulthias Tree dies, Belak loses his influence over the twig blights, Sharwyn, and Sir Braford. These monsters turn on Belak before targeting the characters again.

### Walls

The courtyard's walls stand 20 feet tall, and the cavern's stalactite-dotted ceiling is 50 feet up.

### Treasure

Belak has a key (to **area 53**), three <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch>, two doses of <wc-fetch type="item">antitoxin (vial)</wc-fetch>, and his <wc-fetch type="item">wand of entangle</wc-fetch>. Sharwyn wears her gold Hucrele signet ring (worth 20 gp).

> ### The Gulthias Tree
> 
> A Gargantuan plant, the Gulthias Tree has AC 10 and 35 hit points. It is immune to necrotic, poison, psychic damage, and it has resistance to piercing damage. The tree has vulnerability to fire damage.
> 
> **Fruit:** Two magical fruits (evocation school) ripen on the tree each year. Each fruit resembles an apple, but it slowly extrudes from the tree like a cyst.
> 
> Up to a week before the summer solstice, a ruby red fruit grows. Someone other than a construct who eats a quarter or more of it regains 70 hit points. In addition, any blindness, deafness, and diseases affecting the eater end.
> 
> Up to a week before the winter solstice, a sickly white fruit grows. Someone who eats a quarter or more of it takes 70 necrotic damage. Each fruit has 1d4 seeds that, if planted, grow leafless woody shrubs that animate as twig blights after one year.
> 
> **Tree Thralls:** If a humanoid is bound to the bole of the Gulthias Tree, over the next 24 hours the victim is sucked completely into the tree. Once the victim is completely absorbed into the tree, it becomes the tree's thrall, and is expelled over the course of 1 hour. The Gulthias Tree can have only four thralls at any one time. A victim's skin is rough, gray, and bark-like. A thrall is totally corrupted, becoming neutral evil. Such a creature exists only to serve the Gulthias Tree and those who tend it (such as Belak). It possesses all of its former abilities and gains the following traits:
> 
> **Barkskin:** The thrall's AC can't be lower than 16.
> 
> **Tree Thrall:** If the Gulthias Tree dies, the thrall dies 24 hours later.

### Aftermath

If the characters kill the Gulthias Tree, Sharwyn and Braford die 24 hours later (unless you decide they can be saved somehow). If Belak survives, his former servants turn on him, and he attempts to escape. If he succeeds in getting away, he might appear later to trouble the characters.

If the characters reveal the truth about the fruit's seeds to the villagers of Oakhurst, those folk cut down and burn all growing saplings.

As the villagers set the evil saplings alight, the mayor turns to you with a frank expression.

> #### Mayor
> 
> "You realize that our actions have set loose several of these abominations upon the world. Who knows what these twisted plants are doing now?"

The mayor is right. Twig blights that are already loose in the world can still reproduce through root sprouts, as aspen trees do. Although it is likely a hopeless task, the characters can search out these twig blights and destroy them. It's up to you and your players to determine what happens next. At any rate, if the characters warn Oakhurst's residents about the seeds, they have taken their first steps toward gaining a measure of fame and establishing a rapport with local residents.

In addition, if the characters return the Hucrele signet rings to the family matriarch, they receive the promised monetary award. If they bring back the remains of Sharwyn and Sir Braford, the matriarch begins funeral arrangements and invites the characters to attend. If they accept, they can begin to establish a long-term relationship with the Hucrele family, which can prove useful in later adventures.
