This section contains stat blocks and descriptions for the creatures that appear in _The Lost Dungeon of Rickedness: Big Rick Energy_.

## Creature Stat Blocks

A creature's stat block provides the essential information that you, as the DM, need to run the creature.

### Size

The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. This space is not a measure of the creature's physical dimensions. For example, a typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, but it controls a space that wide. If a Medium orc stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the orc lets them.

#### Size Categories

| <span class="text-center block">Size</span> | Space |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">Tiny</span> | 2½ by 2½ ft. |
| <span class="text-center block">Small</span> | 5 by 5 ft. |
| <span class="text-center block">Medium</span> | 5 by 5 ft. |
| <span class="text-center block">Large</span> | 10 by 10 ft. |
| <span class="text-center block">Huge</span> | 15 by 15 ft. |

#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than itself. When squeezing through such a space, the creature's speed is halved. While squeezing, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against it have advantage.

### Type

A creature's type speaks to its fundamental nature. The following types of creatures appear in this adventure:

**Aberrations**. Utterly alien beings that have no place in the natural world.

**Beasts**. Nonhumanoid creatures that, like real-world animals, are a normal part of the world's ecology.

**Dragons**. Winged, reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power.

**Giants**. Humanoid-like creatures that tower over humans and their kin.

**Humanoids**. Bipedal peoples of the civilized and savage world, including humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings.

**Monstrosities**. Frightening creatures that sometimes resemble beasts but that are often touched by magic and almost never benign.

**Oozes**. Gelatinous creatures that generally have no fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean.

**Plants**. Plant creatures, as opposed to ordinary plants, have some degree of sentience and mobility.

**Undead**. Once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse.

#### Tags

A creature might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, a mimic has the monstrosity (shapechanger) type. These parenthetical tags provide an additional layer of categorization for certain creatures, but they have no bearing on how a creature is used in combat.

### Alignment

A creature's alignment reflects its disposition. Alignment indicates whether a creature leans toward law or chaos and good or evil, or whether a creature is neutral.

##### Any Alignment

Some creatures, such as the veteran, can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the creature's alignment. Depending on the creature, its alignment entry might indicate a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil.

##### Unaligned

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment.

### Armor Class

A creature that wears armor or carries a shield has an AC that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a creature's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and any natural armor or supernatural resilience it might possess.

If a creature wears armor or carries a shield, the kind of armor it wears or shield it carries is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

### Hit Points

A creature usually dies or is destroyed when its hit points drop to 0. For more on hit points, see the rulebook.

### Speed

A creature's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the rulebook.

All creatures have a walking speed; those that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Many of the creatures herein have one or more additional movement modes.

##### Climb

A creature that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The creature doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.

##### Fly

A creature that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. If the creature is <wc-fetch type="condition">incapacitated</wc-fetch> or knocked <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch> while flying, it falls unless it can hover.

##### Swim

A creature that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.

### Ability Scores

Every creature has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they're used in play, see the rulebook.

### Saving Throws

The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are particularly adept at resisting certain kinds of effects.

### Skills

The Skills entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a perceptive and stealthy creature might have higher-than-normal bonuses to Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) and Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Stealth</wc-fetch>) checks.

Skills in a creature's stat block are shown with the total modifier—the creature's ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "Stealth +6," roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> and add 6 when the creature makes an ability check using <wc-fetch type="skill">Stealth</wc-fetch>.

#### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies

Assume a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap out a creature's armor and weapons, you must decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment. see the rulebook for what happens when you use these items without proficiency.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions and other game effects. These immunities are also noted here.

### Senses

The Senses entry notes a creature's passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) score, as well as any special senses the creature might have, such as the following senses.

##### Blindsight

A creature with <wc-fetch type="sense">blindsight</wc-fetch> can perceive its surroundings without having to rely on sight, within a specific radius.

##### Darkvision

A creature with <wc-fetch type="sense">darkvision</wc-fetch> can see in the dark within a specific radius. The creature can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

##### Truesight

A creature with <wc-fetch type="sense">truesight</wc-fetch> can see in normal and magic darkness, see <wc-fetch type="condition">invisible</wc-fetch> creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

### Languages

The languages that a creature can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a creature can understand a language but not speak it, and this is noted in the entry.

### Challenge

An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a creature that has a challenge rating equal to their level without suffering any casualties. Creatures that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have challenge ratings lower than 1.

#### Experience Points (XP)

The number of experience points a creature is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the creature, and characters gain levels as they accumulate XP.

In _The Lost Dungeon of Rickedness_, you don't need to track experience points, as the characters advance in level simply by delving deeper into Rick's ridiculous dungeon (see "Leveling Up," page 6).

### Traits

Traits are special features of the creature that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter.

### Actions

When a creature takes its action, it can choose from the options in the "Actions" section of its stat block. The rulebook describes other actions available to all creatures.

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a creature will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the "weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw.

##### Hit

Any damage or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described here. As the DM, you can take average damage or roll the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented. For example, a monster might deal 4 (<wc-roll>1d8</wc-roll>) slashing damage with its longsword. That notation means you can have the monster deal 4 damage, or you can roll <wc-roll>1d8</wc-roll> to determine the damage.

### Reactions

If a creature can do something unusual with its reaction, that information is contained here. Most creatures don't have special reactions, in which case this section is absent. Reactions are explained in the rulebook.

### Limited Usage

Some special abilities—whether they are traits, actions, or reactions—have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

##### Recharge X–Y

The notation "Recharge X–Y" means a creature can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the creature's turns, roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll>. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains the use of that special ability. The ability also recharges when the creature finishes a short or long rest.
