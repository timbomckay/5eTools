"Umbrage Hill" is balanced for characters of 3rd level or lower. Higher-level characters won't face great peril here, but they might need to visit this location to buy <wc-fetch type="item">Potion of Healing</wc-fetch> from Adabra Gwynn.

## Location Overview

Umbrage Hill got its name after two feuding dwarf clans fought a pitched battle atop it. The cause of their umbrage is a tale lost to time, and only the cairns of the dead now remain. The stone windmill on the hill is a later addition, but is still more than a hundred years old.

Adabra Gwynn, a midwife and apothecary devoted to Chauntea (goddess of agriculture), resides here. A manticore driven out of the mountains by Cryovain the white dragon attacks the windmill shortly before the adventurers arrive. Read the following boxed text to set the scene:

> Built on the slope of Umbrage Hill is an old stone windmill surrounded by an iron fence. A large winged monster with a spiky tail is trying to knock down the windmill's front door. A woman appears in a second-floor window, waves at you, and yells, "A little help?!"

Adabra uses the commoner stat block. Characters can fight or negotiate with the manticore, which ceases its attack and flies away if given at least 25 gp in treasure or a few pounds of meat.

If it's not killed, the manticore could return with its mate to make more trouble in the future.

### Quest Goals

Adabra declines to return to Phandalin, but the characters can complete the **area Umbrage Hill Quest** by asking her for a note for Harbin Wester confirming her safety. Adabra also gives her saviors one <wc-fetch type="item">potion of healing</wc-fetch> for dealing with the manticore (see below).

#### U1. Dwarven Cairns

Dwarves were buried under these rock piles, but their bones, armor, and weapons disintegrated long ago.

#### U2. Ruins of a House

A fireplace is all that remains of this old stone house.

#### U3â€“U5. Stone Windmill

Adabra uses the millstone on the ground floor (area U3) to grind herbs and other ingredients for poultices and potions. Her quarters are on the second floor (area U4). The third floor (area U5) is a loft where guests can stay.

##### Treasure

Adabra sells <wc-fetch type="item">Potion of Healing</wc-fetch> for 50 gp. Give a <wc-fetch type="item">Potion of Healing</wc-fetch> card to any player whose character acquires one of these potions or they can reference it in the Magic Items Listing. If you run out of cards, Adabra has no potions left to sell. (_There are six cards included with the physical product_).
