When a chase begins in the wilderness, the DM can use these rules to determine whether the pursuer catches their quarry.

### Playing a Chase

A chase is played out over the course of rounds, during which each chase participant takes a turn.

Here Are the steps to follow in a chase:

- <b>1. Establish positions.</b> Determine how far apart the quarry and the pursuer are from each other. The quarry and the pursuer might each be an individual or a group. Over the course of the chase, the DM keeps track of this distance. You may use a dry-erase hex map in this kit to track distance. If you do so, you determine how many feet each hex represents: 5 feet, 10 feet, or more.
- <b>2. Roll initiative.</b> Everyone involved in the chase rolls initiative, determining the order of their turns in the chase.
- <b>3. Roll for a complication.</b> When your turn starts, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> and consult the Wilderness Chase Complications table to see if an unexpected event complicates your turn.
- <b>4. Move And take an action.</b> You can take one action on your turn, and before or after that action, you can move upto a distance equal to your speed. See the "Actions in Combat" sheet for the actions you can take during a chase (see the "Dashing" section on the other side of this sheet if you take the <wc-fetch type="action">Dash</wc-fetch> Action). If you have a bonus action available, you also take it during your turn, but no more than once one each of your turns.
- <b>5. Begin the next round.</b> When Everyone Involved in the chase has had a turn, the round ends, and the DM determines whether the chase ends, as detailed in the "Ending a Chase" section on the other side of this sheet. If the chase doesn't end, repeat steps 3â€”5 until it does.

#### Wilderness Chase Complications

| <span class="text-center block">d20</span> | Complication |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1</span> | Your path takes you through a rough patch of brush. Make a DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) or Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check (your choice) to get past the brush. On failed check, the brush counts as 5feet of difficult terrain. |
| <span class="text-center block">2</span> | Uneven ground threatens to slow your progress. Make a DC 10 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check to navigate the area. On failed check, the ground counts as 10 feet of difficult terrain. <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> |
| <span class="text-center block">3</span> | You run through a swarm of insects (see the Monster Manual For game statistics). The swarm makes an opportunity attack against you (+3 to hit; <wc-roll>4d4</wc-roll> piercing damage on a hit). |
| <span class="text-center block">4</span> | A stream, ravine, or rock bed blocks your path. Make a DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type="skill">Athletics</wc-fetch>) or Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check (your choice) to cross the impediment. On a failed check, the impediment counts as 10 feet of difficult terrain. |
| <span class="text-center block">5</span> | Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Ona failed save, you are <wc-fetch type="condition">blinded</wc-fetch> by blowing sand,dirt, ash, snow,or pollen until the end of your turn. While <wc-fetch type="condition">blinded</wc-fetch> in this way, your speed is halved. |
| <span class="text-center block">6</span> | A sudden drop catches you by surprise. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the impediment. On failed save, you fall <wc-roll>1d4 x 5</wc-roll> feet, taking <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen as normal, and land <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch>. |
| <span class="text-center block">7</span> | You blunder into a snare. Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On failed save, you are caught in the snare and <wc-fetch type="condition">restrained</wc-fetch>. As an action, you or someone within 5 feet of you can make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing you on a success. The snare can also be destroyed; it has an AC of 10 and 5 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. Complication |
| <span class="text-center block">8</span> | You are caught in a stampede of spooked animals. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Ona failed save, you are knocked about and take <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> bludgeoning damage and <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> piercing damage. |
| <span class="text-center block">9</span> | Your path takes you near a patch of razorvine. Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or use 10 feet of movement (your choice) to avoid the razorvine. On a failed save, you take <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> slashing damage. |
| <span class="text-center block">10</span> | One or more creatures in the area chase after you! The DM chooses these pursuers or rolls a <wc-roll>d8</wc-roll> to determine them: (1) 2 brown bear, (2) <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> giant toad, (3) <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> poisonous snake, (4) <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> wolf, (5) 1 giant boar, (6) 2 dire wolf, (7) griffon, or (8) <wc-roll>1d12</wc-roll> giant rat (see the Monster Manual for the creatures' game statistics). |
| <span class="text-center block">11-20</span> | No complication. |

#### Dashing

Over the course of a chase, you can take the <wc-fetch type="action">Dash</wc-fetch> action a limited number of times before you risk <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch>. That number equals 3 + your Constitution modifier. Each additional <wc-fetch type="action">Dash</wc-fetch> action you take after that number during the chase requires you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of your turn or gain | level of <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch>.

You drop out of the chase if your <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> reaches level 5, since your speed becomes0. By finishing a short or long rest, you can remove all the levels of <wc-fetch type="condition">exhaustion</wc-fetch> you gained by taking the <wc-fetch type="action">Dash</wc-fetch> action additional times during the chase.

#### Reactions

During a chase, you can take reactions as normal, but you can't make opportunity attacks against other chase participants, since you are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, chase participants can still be the targets of opportunity attacks from creatures not participating in the chase. For example, an adventurer who chases a bandit past a wolf in the woods might provoke an opportunity attack from the wolf.

### Ending a Chase

A chase ends when one side or the other stops, when the quarry escapes, or when at least one pursuer is within 5 feet of a quarry.

If neither side gives up the chase, the quarry can make a Dexterity (<wc-fetch type="skill">Stealth</wc-fetch>) check at the end of each round, after every participant in the chase has taken a turn. An <wc-fetch type="condition">incapacitated</wc-fetch> quarry can't make this check, nor can a quarry without anything to hide behind. The check's total is compared to the passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type="skill">Perception</wc-fetch>) scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple creatures, they all make the check. If the total of a quarry's check is greater than the highest passive score, that quarry escapes and is no longer in the chase.

The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on the check based on prevailing circumstances, as shown in the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, the quarry has neither, as usual.

#### Escape Factors

| Factor | Check Has... |
| - | - |
| Quarry has many things to hide behind | Advantage |
| Quarry is in a very crowded or noisy area | Advantage |
| Quarry has few things to hide behind | Disadvantage |
| Quarry is in an uncrowded or quiet area | Disadvantage |
| The lead pursue ris a ranger or has proficiency in <wc-fetch type="skill">Survival</wc-fetch> | Disadvantage |

Escape doesn't necessarily mean a quarry has outpaced pursuers. For example, in the mountains, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a crevice or a hollow log.

### Splitting Up

Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each separate group.

### Role Reversal

During a chase,it's possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For example, characters chasing a bandit through the woods might draw unwanted attention from other bandits. As they pursue the fleeing bandit, they must also evade the bandits pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, the fleeing bandit might run into the waiting arms of their accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide to flee with the bandits in pursuit
