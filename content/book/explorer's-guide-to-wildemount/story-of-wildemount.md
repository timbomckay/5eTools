> Born from nothing, there was something. Light, then thought, then life and fire. We who are born of the will of the gods keep these records to preserve their deeds, their design, and their lessons. We who live by our own will shall keep these records to know where we walk and where not to tread. We who look to our inevitable end keep these records to teach those who succeed our footsteps how to be better than we could.

## History of Wildemount

The continent of Wildemount has undergone many ages of discovery, conflict, and renewal. These bygone eras are more than ancient history. Whether the people of Wildemount know it or not, the struggles they face in their daily lives were set in motion by the turbulent events of past ages. This section explores this history and the major figures whose actions shaped the physical and cultural landscape of Wildemount.

### Myth of Exandria

Life ever seeks to understand its inception. Every civilization has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with recorded history, but there is no universally accepted story. Even so, the ancient city of Vasselheim on the distant continent of Othanzia is largely considered to be the oldest surviving city, having endured a terrible war that wiped out most of civilization nearly a thousand years ago. Vasselheim houses the earliest known temples to the gods, as well as the earliest known records of history that survived this catastrophic war.

The most widely accepted tale of the world's origins is the myth of the Founding. This is the interpretation held and embraced within most of Wildemount, as well as the vast lands of Exandria as a whole.

### The Founding

Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and chaotic forces, naught but unbridled fires and churning, jagged rock. Through the ashen skies of Creation Primordial, the gods came from beyond the ether, new and formless. Looking on this roiling realm, they saw potential for great beauty, great strength, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.

Thus, divine hands birthed the First Children, the elves, who embodied beauty and grace, to walk the verdant Green and know the music of the Blue. A second creation was wrought: the dwarves, a hearty people intent on taming the land, filled with the craft and invention of the divinity beyond the ashen void. A third people were given life: the humans, endowed with hearts of passion that burned as brightly as their spans of life were short, and infused with the need to celebrate and laugh.

Other creations followed as the many races of Exandria were given form from the boundless inspiration the of the protean gods. These Children of Creation walked the land and, as their knowledge grew, attempted to build on it. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the children were dashed on the rocks and consumed by the elements. Sorrow filled the hearts of the gods as these first races struggled against a land that did not want them, and the children looked to their creators for guidance and protection. Thus, the gods gave to them gifts, lending their own power to their children to create and shape the world around them; these were the first divine magics.

With these magics, the various peoples learned to bend the angry earth to their will: to temper the flames that burst through the ground, to tame the floods that threatened their abundance, and to turn seedling into fruit and beast into meal. Language became commonplace, culture was born, and governance replaced anarchy. The protean creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good, yet fragile and in need of guardians.

Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Exandria, who safeguarded the gentler races. The realm grew quieter, the people multiplied, and new beings were given form and life. As culture grew, and the people further understood the world around them, they also looked up to their creators and gave them worship, gave them form, gave them title and purpose.

But this realm did not wish to be tamed. Quaking cliffs roared in defiance. Seas swelled and swallowed. Flames erupted from the land. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen skies, lived ancient beings who had already claimed this world as their home: the Primordials. These great elemental titans that once dwelt deep within the world now rose from their unseen domain to sunder the land once more. The gods watched as their children, their joy, were flung against the broken rocks or fed to formless terrors unleashed by the destruction. Demonic entities spilled from the umbra of the Abyss to feast on the carnage, called forth by the violence and released to pick the carrion clean.

Some gods were so full of grief and anger that they wished to leave this world behind and start anew. They tried to convince their divine kindred to join with the Primordials, allowing chaos to reclaim the realm. Other gods wished to remain and subdue the Primordials, to tame the land for the sake of their creations. Thus was created a divide among the gods. Celestial sentinels once dedicated to battling the chaotic forces of the Abyss now fell to hate and tyranny, forging new hells under a fallen angel now claiming lordship over all the realms of sulfur and brimstone.

The Creators that remained, wishing to salvage their home, their creations, and their realized selves, were forced to take up arms and learn to protect that which they valued most. They organized their followers and taught them how to draw from the powers of creation on their own: to build, to change, and to destroy, all without the aid of divine power. Mortals learned to defend themselves through practices such as alchemy or by bending the very fabrics of existence, though on a smaller scale than that of their creators.

This gift was the knowledge of arcane magic, which the good children used to drive away their traitorous kin, banish the turned Creators to their own prison-like planes, and ultimately destroy the Primordials, scattering the chaotic elements to their own planes of existence. The world was at peace for the first time since its creation, and the first real civilization took root and grew into a grand city called Vasselheim. The Cradle of Creation. The Dawn City.

Culture developed anew, the races ventured forth to discover and explore their own lands, and great music filled the air to give a name to this world once and for all: Exandria.

### Age of Arcanum

Over time, some of the people of Exandria grew arrogant. Seeing their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway over their fate, a belief developed that, with enough understanding, they too could become as powerful as the gods. Many began to shun faith in favor of their own pursuits. Though this hurt and surprised the Creators, they understood the willfulness of their children and endured out of love and hope for redemption.

Great kingdoms sprung up across Exandria. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists' newfound power. Erudite cities hovered and drifted through the skies, shifting under the direction of scholarly magi to wherever their interests took them. Even though magic could be used to complete the most difficult tasks with hitherto unknown speed, magic-users strove always to innovate. As mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving birth to wondrous, dangerous new creatures and power. Powerful archmages such as Vecna the Whispered One and Halas Lutagran began to carve their paths into history during this era of unbridled magical experimentation.

The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Petty squabbles erupted over resources and wealth among the elite, while the rumor of immortality through perfected arcanum began to drive the greatest mages wild with a lust for unending power. One mortal mage, her name either lost or struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making her the first and only mortal to ascend to godhood. The archmage Vespin Chloras was inspired by this display. Driven by his hunger, he sought the guidance and power of the banished gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the betrayers into the mortal world.

During their imprisonment, these gods of hatred and despair twisted their prison into their own image, spawning unthinkable horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed. The Nine Hells and the Abyss began to push their way into Creation. The Betrayer Gods and their hateful children discovered a world unspoiled, save for the avarice of mortals. The urge to ruin was now replaced with the desire to dominate, and the Betrayer Gods began by turning on the mage who freed them, making Archmage Vespin their first thrall. This corrupted divinity sought out the remnants of their offspring, scattered across the world, and created a mighty and terrible new kingdom on the plains of Xhorhas, at the far end of the world from Vasselheim—Ghor Dranas.

In this land of evil, where the twisted power of the lower planes seeped into Exandria, the lords of darkness tainted the minds of mortals, hungrily welcoming those who had lost their way, and offering great promises and boons to hearts easily swayed. These poisonous seeds found fertile ground in the hearts of mortals obsessed with the unlimited power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned behind them, the Betrayer Gods soon made their presence known to the world with an assault on Vasselheim itself.

Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of the Prime Deities themselves, who descended to trade blows with their former brethren. The battle between divinity and mortals, between heroes and demons, raged ceaselessly for twenty days and nights until the dark forces, their surprise attack thwarted, were finally forced to retreat.

Evil was repulsed momentarily, but with the revelation of such a terrible foe, a dangerous arcane arms race began. Trust was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the Betrayer Gods, who was an ally? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of the gods, how were they relevant? Not trusting any but themselves, the self-interested and singular humans reforged their instruments of celebration into instruments of incredible power—artifacts that could be wielded by worthy heroes. The dwarves' fascination with rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed deeper into the mountains, using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. Elves used their understanding of creation's beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria had never seen before.

For the first time since the Primordials were destroyed, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as the Calamity.

![The Calamity](book/EGW/004-01-01.png)

### The Calamity

The battlefields of the catastrophic showdowns of the Calamity were scattered across Exandria, but it was Wynandir that suffered the full destructive powers of the gods. Divided by the Ashkeeper Peaks, the fields of Wynandir were once home to several powerful ruling houses, squabbling over their own goals before being drawn into either side of the conflict of the gods, or abstaining for their own reasons. The immensity of power wielded by the Prime Deities and Betrayer Gods was enough to wound the landscape for eons, and the irresponsible use of arcane knowledge developed by the mortals ensured the ruin of their own legacy.

Little record remains of the terrible war, but its effects are still felt today. The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in the ensuing battles by gods and mortals alike was enough to fray the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world. It completely rearranged the known flow of magical ley energy across Exandria. The dark kingdom of Ghor Dranas was reduced to ash, but the conflict devastated Exandria's peoples, razing entire cities and inspiring in many a desire to flee from this plane of existence entirely. So great was the loss of life during the war that historians believe no more than a third of Exandria's population survived, leaving only one remaining bastion of civilization: the Dawn City, Vasselheim.

The world entered a long, dark period of regrowth. The Betrayer Gods were banished once more to their realms of deception and hate, but the threat of their return weighed heavily on the world. The Prime Deities felt that their involvement in mortal conflict was to blame for the cataclysmic damage inflicted on Exandria. They knew that while the divine gateways were left open, the prison planes that held the banished Betrayers would remain imperfect and temporary.

Thus, hoping to ensure that such ruin would not befall Exandria again, they left their children to fend for themselves. The Creators returned to their own realms, dragging both Betrayer and abomination with them and sealing the pathways to the mortal realm behind them with the Divine Gate. Only in this way could they prevent their corrupted brethren from physically returning to the material plane. Sadly, for the Prime Deities, this action also carried with it a self-imposed sentence of exile. The Creators would henceforth never be allowed to visit their creation.

The disappearance of the gods is known by many names: the Second Spark for those who study the arcane, and the Penance for those who seek closeness to their gods. The most common name for this time of warfare and divine separation is the Divergence, and it marked the end of the Age of Arcanum.

Much time has passed since, and the world has been reborn once again. The gods still influence and guide from beyond the Divine Gate, bestowing knowledge and power on their worshipers, but the path of mortals is now their own to make. New cities, kingdoms, and cultures have retaken the world, building over the ashes of the old. New songs fill the air, and the hope of a brighter future drives people day after day, while buried ruins and ancient relics remind all people of a darker time of mistakes that should never be repeated.

## Wildemount after the Calamity

In the wake of the vast destruction of the Calamity and the exile of the pantheon in the Divergence, the survivors began to emerge from the ash and shadows to reclaim and rebuild Exandria. Across the continents, many took the pieces of their cultures and sought a place to forge a new age. This tome focuses on the rebirth of the deeply scarred land now known as Wildemount, the site of the most terrible conflicts of the Calamity, where the echoes of those deadly battles linger to this day.

### In the Wake of the Gods

After the Calamity, the lands of Wildemount became wild and perilous, filled with monstrosities and beasts that prowled its broken fields and shattered mountains. The land's new denizens reclaimed the newly untamed realm, hunting any mortals not clever enough to hide. The masterless creations of the Betrayer Gods ruled their own territories, establishing themselves as a new pantheon.

As the dust settled, surviving mortals grasped at what they could from their bygone lives and hid away in fear of what would come next. Those of faith dealt with their sense of failure and abandonment, while enlightened scribes mourned the loss of their research and the great magical secrets that had enabled the previous age to rise to such prominence.

Others picked up what they could from the ruins and chose to start anew, hoping that their descendants would learn from their mistakes. Over those early centuries, the scattered survivors fought back the terrors that stalked the abandoned lands of Wildemount, continuing to endure and build new societies, civilizations that eventually reclaimed Wildemount and brought the world to this modern age.

### Western Wynandir

The lands of Western Wynandir were the epicenter of the Calamity's destruction. Rocky ranges of mountains were sundered, entire landscapes burned, and hovering seats of power crashed down from the sky, their floating cities consumed beneath the hungry earth.

#### Grimgolir

The dwarven clan of Grimgol that once helped hold the center of the Ashkeeper Peaks was nearly wiped out during the Calamity. The surviving families and warriors burrowed deep beneath the surface of Exandria to wait out the chaos. Collapsing nearly every established tunnel used in the wars above, the clan found themselves cut off from the rest of Exandria. For centuries, the dwarves of Clan Grimgol endured the darkness alone, defending against the dregs of the Betrayer Gods' forces and adapting themselves into a hardy and stalwart people.

Half-remembered tales and myths of their forgotten history, mingled with worship of Moradin, began to stir an eagerness to return to their ancestral home and build anew. With new purpose, they carved their way back toward the surface, only to find the mountains of their home reduced to dust and pebbles.

Not easily dissuaded, the dwarves returned to the surface for the first time in generations, finding the once-ruined world now recovering with renewed life and color. The resilient clan made their way north along the Brokenveil Bluffs and found a massive mountain to house their new city. They built their stronghold into this monolith among the Dunrock Mountains, and gave their new home the name of Grimgolir.

#### Rise of the Julous Dominion

In the Marrow Valley, the numerous decades following the Divergence left the landscape blackened and inhospitable. The remaining people struggled for food and shelter as they wandered the rocky hills for centuries, avoiding the colder weather of the north. Nomadic sects of humans and halflings defended themselves against the hungry beasts and lingering evils threatening their homesteads, and fought with each other over fertile land.

Small civilizations began to form amid the chaos, but it wasn't until the central township of Zadash was established as a safe outpost that the unification of the Marrow Valley began. Helmed by the Julous family, supposedly of noble blood from before the Calamity, a guarded community with an organized military force was built in the center of the valley around four hundred years ago. It became both a haven for the struggling masses and a center for agricultural expansion.

Increasing their strength with each generation, this movement guided by the Julous family became known as the Julous Dominion, stretching across the south end of Western Wynandir. Not all agreed to join the Julous Dominion, however. Some outliers rejected the Julous interests, founding their own village of Kamordah on the boiling earth of the hills in the southwest Marrow Valley. In time, the people of Kamordah came to worship a being of primordial fire that lives beneath the mountains and speaks to them in dreams and visions.

#### Founding of the Dwendalian Empire

In the frigid fields north of the Marrow Valley, the survivors of the Arcanum city of Zemniaz scraped by in the snow for centuries, clutching their surviving scrolls and fragments of cultural history. They established the dour outposts of Icehaven and Yrrosa, but it wasn't until the Zemnian people wandered east to the Pearlbow Wilderness that they found fields that were fertile enough to nurture a new society.

Founded atop the ruins of an ancient temple to the Dawn Father, the city of Rexxentrum rose to become the hub of Zemnian culture. Now that the Zemnian people no longer had to struggle for survival amid the harsh elements, their leaders argued over how to establish a centralized government. Some wished for a republic, while others sought a theocracy under the priests that shepherded the people into this new age. Eckhardt Dwendal, a well-respected merchant and tremendous force behind the development of Rexxentrum, wished to institute a monarchy and place his son Manfried on the throne. Debate spun wildly for over three years, while Eckhardt privately made deals with the heads of the emerging guilds, using promises or blackmail to secure their cooperation. With the resounding support of the flourishing guild heads, the throne was established. In the year 539 of the post-Divergence era, Manfried became the first emperor of the Dwendalian Empire.

#### The Marrow War

It wasn't long before the expanding borders of the Dwendalian Empire began to push up against the growing Julous Dominion. An agreement was brokered to avoid conflict as long as favorable trade could be established and maintained. Even so, the resource-rich center of Western Wynandir was split between the two states, with both factions eager to discover the other's weaknesses. Rumors of the discovery of a massive platinum mine within the Julous Dominion further increased the empire's desire to conquer their neighbor.

At this time, religious leaders throughout the Dwendalian Empire rebelled against the emperor's religious restrictions. After his coronation, Emperor Manfried Dwendal enacted laws limiting worship and prayer to subjects concerning the power, profit, and expansion of the empire. In the year 544 PD, internal strife and insurgent action turned bloody when the zealous leaders of varying faiths attempted, and failed, to usurp the throne for their council. An angered Emperor Manfried Dwendal had the rebellious priests executed—an event that came to be known as the Admonition.

The emperor spoke of abolishing all worship within his boundaries. This caused further uproar among the populace, but then Emperor Manfried's spies discovered that the seeds of the uprising had been sown by Julous interests. Publicly exposing the plot, the emperor outlawed only select faiths that he felt threatened civilized life. He redirected much of the people's fury by also proclaiming the Julous Dominion an enemy of the empire later that year and declaring war on the neighboring nation.

Meanwhile, the Julous Dominion was dealing with the refusal of the outlying villages near Kamordah to accept their rule in this time of brewing hostility. They eventually drove the independent villagers back into the Cyrios Mountains, just in time to hear the horns of war blaring from the empire to the north. The violent conflict known as the Marrow War lasted over sixteen months and cost the lives of many soldiers and innocents on both sides of the Marrow Valley.

The Julous Dominion lacked the unified military force of the empire. When a major military push left the capital city of Zadash occupied by the empire, Baron Inock Julous and Baroness Tessandra Julous met with Emperor Manfried to negotiate a peace. During this meeting, the baron and baroness were unceremoniously executed. Their bodies were displayed publicly along with the narrative that they had attempted an assassination on the emperor during the peace talks. Disheartened and bereft of leadership, the Julous Dominion immediately came to an end, as did the war.

To prove his benevolence to the people of the newly conquered Julous Dominion, and to help avoid future uprisings, Emperor Manfried declared that all citizens of the dominion would keep their lands and homesteads. No soldiers would stand trial or be punished for their previous allegiance. Life would continue as it had, except for the implementation of imperial taxes, laws, and oversight across the valley under the new emperor. Outlawed religious iconography was destroyed, crops and goods were redistributed according to the needs of the empire, and life slowly returned to normal for the Zemnian people.

#### A King Is Crowned

With citizens of the former Julous Dominion tense beneath their new rule and a growing sentiment of frustration with imperial leadership building, Emperor Manfried sought a way to reform the nation under his banner. The propagandist minds who fought the social war with the Julous Dominion recommended a shift in public image and title, one that could command more respect within Western Wynandir while casting aside the oppressive connotations of the title of emperor. Still riding high on the victory against the Dominion, Emperor Manfried harkened back to the halcyon lore of the Age of Arcanum, recalling the beloved kings and queens of old. It was decided that the people would no longer have an emperor, but a king. Crowning himself the first of the line of Dwendalian kings, King Manfried insisted on maintaining the now-ominous national title of the Dwendalian Empire, famously proclaiming, "I am the Dwendalian king to my people, beloved and open to their wishes. To our enemies, we remain resolute and unstoppable. We are the Dwendalian Empire."

#### The Eve of Crimson Midnight

Not a quarter century after the Marrow War ended and the line of kings was established, a smaller, internal conflict rocked the capital city of Rexxentrum. A number of noble houses with a strong history of studying arcane pursuits began to compete with other high-born magic practitioners from the Julous Dominion. Throughout the lands of the newly expanded empire, these houses escalated their subterfuge and espionage against one another, until the rivalry finally erupted into an all-out magical conflict in the streets of the capital itself.

The events of the Eve of Crimson Midnight destroyed numerous buildings and maimed a number of innocents caught in the crossfire. The struggle ended with all involved shackled and brought before the king. After days of deliberation, an agreement was drawn up that would absolve those involved of the usual punishment in exchange for direct subservience to the Crown and the goals of the empire. Establishing themselves as the Cerberus Assembly, this council of mages became a powerful tool for the empire to maintain its position as the dominant force of Wildemount.

#### Modern Dwendalian Empire

For three hundred years, the empire has expanded and prospered under the rule of the Dwendalian line of kings. King Alfwin Dwendal increased the empire's military power by establishing the stronghold of Bladegarden and assimilating Grimgolir into the empire, seeking to hold back the savage creatures of Xhorhas. King Theoderich Dwendal's benevolent nature brokered the partnership with the Clovis Concord of the Menagerie Coast without bloodshed and ushered in new opportunities for trade with the rest of Exandria. King Willamar Dwendal established the initial prominence of House Truscan and granted them oversight of the Truscan Vale, to the displeasure of the other noble houses.

Other kings have come and gone, but few have made as immediate and lasting a mark as King Bertrand Dwendal. On assuming the throne in 790 PD, King Bertrand immediately demonstrated his love of spectacle and social manipulation by instituting town criers across the empire to disseminate Crown-approved messages. With the aid of Master Ikithon Trent of the Cerberus Assembly, he captured the imagination of the masses with well-crafted tales of his deeds, proclaimed by the criers in every town square.

Seeking to bury any dissent against the Crown, King Dwendal began to use the empire's spy network to seek out sources of unrest in the public and punish those who sowed thoughts of rebellion. Public holidays and celebrations were given greater funding to quell the masses and distract the people from the increase in taxation implemented across the valley. This allowed King Bertrand Dwendal to rise in popularity while also ruling with a far more ruthless and self-serving agenda than most kings before him.

King Bertrand maintains the isolationist world view of his predecessors, even in times of need. By ignoring political alliances from distant nations, preventing the construction of any skyship docks within the empire, and ignoring calls for aid—such as the fight against the rising threat of Vecna two decades before—the King believes he has made the empire stronger than it's ever been.

However, the king's focus on isolationism fades as tensions with Xhorhas grow. Worry about his legacy mingles with the new and deadly threat of the Kryn Dynasty, now emboldened and pushing into his kingdom with strange magics and dangerous warriors. He mistrusts the very Cerberus Assembly that grants him so much influence and arcane might to combat the ever-darker world that barks at the borders of the empire. Public approval of his rule wanes with growing economic disparity, and the whisper of Myriad power returning under his nose only heightens his paranoia.

When the Kryn orchestrated an attack on the Halls of Erudition in Zadash, the Cerberus Assembly pushed for a display of military power to rally the people and bring unity to the national identity of the empire. The king declared war on the Kryn Dynasty and the people of Xhorhas, embroiling the region in this new full-scale conflict, with the hope that, as history has proven, people are easier to unite against a common enemy.

### The Menagerie Coast

While destruction came to the farthest reaches of the world during the divine conflicts of the Calamity, the islands of the Lucidian Ocean off the western coast of Wildemount thought they might fare better than most. But though they were far removed from the central fury of the magics unleashed in the final battles, the region's civilizations were instead wiped out by massive floods. Immense tidal surges left the coast drowned and empty, the islands consumed by the raging ocean, leaving behind only the most accomplished of sailors. Eventually, the waters settled once more, and nature swiftly reclaimed the lands with lush green jungles.

#### The Ki'Nau

The few scattered survivors of the floods found shelter among the higher jungles of the Swavain Islands, gifted with the bounty of a more plentiful and tropical environment. These seafaring people rebuilt among the islands and took the name Ki'Nau, meaning "the Water Children" in their language of Naush. Though the terrible floods of the Calamity had passed, the deadly seas and flourishing horrors of the wilds were still a persistent threat to the Ki'Nau. Each generation struggled to survive the elements that sunk their boats and the predators of the jungles and ocean depths.

Over time, an older mind began to call from the waters and entered their dreams. This powerful being, a leviathan creation abandoned by his creator Zehir in the Divergence, called himself Uk'otoa. He spoke of his divinity and promised protection to the Ki'Nau people in exchange for their worship. The Ki'Nau accepted the persuasive entity as an ally and protector, allowing Uk'otoa to rise up as the guardian of the islands and help the Ki'Nau become a proud society of warriors, establishing dominance over the region for centuries.

![Uk'otoa assaults unwelcome ships on the Lucidian Ocean](book/EGW/006-01-03.png)

#### The Marquesian Alliance

Around the year 400 PD, an exploration vessel from the distant land of Marquet was nearing the end of its provisions when it reached the Swavain Islands. Discovered and captured by the ever-watchful Ki'Nau, the desperate explorers made trade offerings of foreign gold, spices, and fine silks. This diplomatic approach won over the leaders of the Ki'Nau, and an alliance was made with the Marquesian travelers to return with trade goods and establish a Marquesian outpost, which was to be named Damali.

During this time, a cruel seafaring culture called the Vukan discovered the Ki'Nau and coveted their lush homesteads and rich, sea-gathered jewelry. These Vukan began a series of coordinated assaults on the Ki'Nau, killing and kidnapping a number of them under the shadow of night. The Marquesian guilds who had sent the exploration ship agreed to offer naval support to combat these attacks, but it was Uk'otoa whose fury ultimately annihilated the Vukan at their home villages and erased them from Exandria.

Having lost a portion of their fleet in these fights, the surviving Marquesian naval ships remained to build small settlements along the coast to aid in their trade with the Ki'Nau. The Ki'Nau leader Tauan kept a tentative peace with the foreign sailors, but Uk'otoa wanted to dominate the new arrivals who refused to renounce their old gods and bow to him. These tensions came to a head when a secret sect of Marquesian worshipers of the Cloaked Serpent Zehir were given a task by their enraged god from beyond the Divine Gate: to destroy Uk'otoa for his insolence. With the aid of a powerful cult leader within an archeological guild known as the Allegiance of Allsight, a series of temples built to Uk'otoa were corrupted with Zehir's influence and used to seal Uk'otoa deep beneath the rock of the ocean floor, robbing the Ki'Nau of their patron.

#### Birth of the Clovis Concord

At this time, the city of Ank'Harel in Marquet had just named the mysterious J'mon Sa Ord as their new emperor. In the transition, the Marquesian colonists now living along the coast demanded independence from Marquet to begin building their own society and identity alongside the Ki'Nau. Ord eventually accepted the request, and the emancipated Marquesians allied themselves with the Ki'Nau to build a new civilization. Over the following centuries, numerous port towns sprung up and grew into city states, trade routes expanded along what is now known as the Menagerie Coast, and the emerging guilds consolidated enough power to become the region's ruling class: the Clovis Concord.

The concord works together to keep the surrounding Lucidian Ocean under their watch and rule, setting trade laws and guiding the fortunes of those who sail on the open waters. The blend of cultures that forms the Menagerie Coast creates a diverse community where the arts are lauded and coin is king. However, the shadow of the Myriad syndicate continues to infiltrate the streets, while the pirate alliance known as the Revelry has risen to harry the trade routes and rebel against the concord. Tensions are further escalated by the threat of expanding war to the northeast between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty.

### The Greying Wildlands

The fierce powers released in the conflicts of the Calamity tore through the heavily forested region now known as the Greying Wildlands, setting ablaze a slow-burning arcane forest fire that smoldered for nearly a century, burning through the hearty trees of the region like a plague of embers. The northern realm was left desolate, ashes and dirt blown into dust and sand as the chill northern winds transformed the rolling hills into a desert of ice and pebbles. Fleeing remnants of the Grimgol dwarves delved into the snow-hooded Flotket Alps, many freezing to death in the wind-battered valleys before finding safety in the natural caverns hiding deep in the mountain range. Within these icy depths, the dwarves cultivated fiery hearths and brought warmth to the heart of the mountain, establishing the new dwarven city of Uthodurn.

#### Molaesmyr

Amid the charred remains of the burning forest that filled the sky with smoke for over a hundred years, one section of the woods defied the flames and held against the embers that battered it. This small patch of idyllic green endured, a sanctuary for the surviving wood elves that held fast and hoped for a miracle. Sensing that the blessings of Melora and Corellon had kept the heart of this forest alive until the fires burned out, the elves began to build a new home among the ancient trees and groves.

This region became the Veluthil Forest, and from this verdant sanctuary, the elves would build the stunningly beautiful city of Molaesmyr. From the surrounding ashes, the fey magics of Veluthil brought forth new life and leaf, expanding the boundaries of the forest over centuries to eventually reclaim much of the Wildlands. Druidic forces and powerful fey enchantments were laid throughout the twisting paths of the forest to protect the elves of Molaesmyr as they expanded their towering city, the central trees reaching magically enhanced heights as homes and halls extended high into the boughs. The elven city stood as the height of reborn civilization on Wildemount.

#### The Corruption

It is still unclear what triggered the event. Whether some knowledge-hungry researcher or arrogant sorcerer was delving in forgotten vaults between the planes, or some terrible power lying dormant beneath the forest was awakened, the source of the corruption is unknown. What is known is that in the year 585 PD, suddenly and without warning, a wave of purple-gray shadow rapidly crept from the center of Molaesmyr to engulf the entire city.

Many elves choked and died on toxic fumes, while others were twisted and driven mad, transforming into terrifying fey abominations. Trees bent and warped, leaves withered and turned a sickly purple, and strange, unknown bramble growths reclaimed the forest floor. This corruption slowly spread throughout the entire Veluthil Forest, decimating the home of the elves. Some survivors fled as fast as they could to the northwest, across the Frigid Depths, eventually settling the township of Bysaes Tyl in the Pearlbow Wilderness. Others escaped to the northeast, seeking refuge in the Flotket Alps, freezing in the snowy mountains until they stumbled on the dwarves of Uthodurn.

Taking pity on the survivors, the dwarves took in the elven refugees and offered them a home. This act of kindness changed the course of Uthodurn's history, eventually forming a unique union of dwarven and elven culture that has endured for nearly three centuries. Craftsmanship within Uthodurn is second to none, but nothing is traded beyond the borders of the city, aside from the odd stolen artifact. Small excavation parties are often sent to the corrupted Veluthil Forest—now called the Savalirwood—to search the ruins of Molaesmyr, attempting to piece together what caused the corruption and determine if the forest can be recovered.

Unfortunately, a township of criminals and outlaws has sprung up on the southern edge of the Savalirwood, just beyond the Dwendalian Empire. In addition to the dangerous denizens of this wretched thicket, which is known as Shadycreek Run, there are numerous raiders and thieves seeking relics from the ruins of the forest, escalating conflict throughout the region.

### Eastern Wynandir

The once thickly forested landscape of Xhorhas was the site of the final battleground of the Calamity. It was subjugated to such intense destruction at the hands of the warring gods that when the dust of the Divergence cleared, Eastern Wynandir was naught but a cracked, ashen wasteland. Ghor Dranas, the citadel of the Betrayer Gods, lay broken, cursed, and abandoned, while lingering demons and monstrosities fled to the surrounding jagged cliffs and blackened marshlands. Discarded abominations seeped from beneath the ruined earth of Xhorhas's eastern shores, climbing past the Penumbra Range where the forgotten creations of the Betrayers were locked away.

Throughout this wasteland, scattered bands of aimless men, beasts, and goblinkin battled for shelter and sustenance. These tribes were confined to their desolate home by the Ki'Nau leviathan who guarded the waters past the southern shores and the surviving dwarves of Grimgolir, who prevented any Xhorhasians from moving farther west. The nomadic, warring clans fought against the harsh conditions of the valley for centuries, only able to develop small bastions of civilization within the harsh wilderness.

#### The Kryn Dynasty

Beneath the ruins of Ghor Dranas, a group of scavenging drow turned from Lolth, their primary deity for centuries, finding renewed faith in an esoteric entity they called the Luxon. Guided by the light of their new deity, the drow survived their ascent from deep within the Underdark and reclaimed the halls of Ghor Dranas for themselves, naming their new home Rosohna, or "Rebirth." The leading house of Kryn helped build a new nation of dark elves who sought the surface as part of their worship, and slowly began to reach out to the nearby nomads to unite under the light of the Luxon.

As the first nation of post-Calamity Xhorhas, the Kryn Dynasty worked to expand its reach throughout the wasteland and bring unity to the ravaging hordes. Dormant evils continued to rise from beneath the marshes and badlands of Xhorhas, spreading chaos and battling with the warriors who called the desolate valley their home. The struggle to convert the denizens of Eastern Wynandir to the light of the Luxon continues to this day, while the agents of Lolth seek to spite and destroy her once-chosen for their arrogance.

Meanwhile, the dragonborn have begun to reach out to Exandria's sprawling political world, wishing to exchange knowledge and trade their gold and jewels for powerful magics to better their standing.

#### Draconia

After the Calamity, a shard of the destroyed dragonkin city of Kethesk came to rest within the southern Dreemoth Ravine. The surviving dragonborn took advantage of the ravine's defensible layout to build a new city and made an alliance with the cave-dwelling, indigenous dragonborn they called ravenites, beginning the reformation of civilized dragonborn society.

With the ravenites as a labor force, the dragonborn harvested the massive brumestone crystals that had once held their city aloft, and the new city of Draconia began to take shape as a series of floating islands within the heart of the chasm. Calling themselves draconbloods, they spent hundreds of years slowly reconstructing their nation in seclusion, focusing entirely on their own enlightenment and pursuits. They eventually enslaved the ravenites to mine the ravine's gold and gemstones, and to ensure draconblood dominance in the region, leaving their minds free to focus on internal politics and arcane advancement.

#### The Chroma Conclave

In the year 815 PD, an unexpected assault on Draconia came in the form of a group of ancient chromatic dragons calling themselves the Chroma Conclave. The mighty city of Draconia was immediately destroyed and left to crumble in the Dreemoth Ravine. A powerful white dragon called Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, claimed the ravine as its new domain, while the rest of the dragons sought conquest elsewhere in Exandria. These events shook the nations of Wildemount, sending the Clovis Concord and the Dwendalian Empire into a state of alert, while the Kryn Dynasty temporarily withdrew to Rosohna, fearing another attack.

As time passed, Vorugal and the entire Chroma Conclave were slain and the danger seemed to have dissipated. With Draconia sundered, the no-longer enslaved ravenites greatly outnumbered their previous masters; they claimed their freedom and punished the surviving draconbloods. A handful of draconian nobles fled to the Menagerie Coast or the Dwendalian Empire to seek asylum, leaving the ravenites to rebuild Wildemount dragonborn society on the ruins of their oppressors.

#### The War of the Ash and Light

In the past century, the Dwendalian Empire has clashed with the Kryn Dynasty. Small skirmishes and slain soldiers on both sides deter expansion beyond the Ashkeeper Peaks, with each faction keeping a close eye on the other.

Recently, the empire's interest in growing Kryn influence has led to increasing curiosity about the source of the Kryn's mysterious arcane capabilities. Dwendalian spies successfully stole two of four artifacts known as "<wc-fetch type="item">luxon beacon</wc-fetch>," which seemed to be powerful sources of the unique magical energy called dunamis. The Bright Queen Leylas Kryn began an initiative steal back the beacons and assault Dwendalian strongholds until these sacred relics are returned. Now, in 835 PD, the resulting skirmishes have escalated into all-out war. A fifth beacon has been recently uncovered by the Cerberus Assembly, and the violence threatens to grow past the Ashkeeper Peaks and embroil other denizens of Wildemount in the conflict.

## Pantheon of Exandria

The Divine Gate, established during the Divergence, is a powerful barrier between the Material Plane and the divine realms. The Divine Gate sealed away both the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities within their respective domains in hopes of salvaging the new age and preventing another Calamity. If the Divine Gate were to be destroyed by the unanimous effort of the Prime Deities, all powers would be unleashed, threatening armageddon. Thus, the gods patiently watch their creations from beyond the veil, lending what small power they can send through the gate to aid the goals of their faithful. In the absence of the gods, lesser entities seek to gain power and influence, making pacts with mortals and offering their own gifts in exchange for favor, worship, or deeds done in their name.

The following gods, patrons, and titles are recommended as the existing pantheon, but they are only a recommendation. You are welcome to alter, supplement, or completely change the gods in your Wildemount campaign to fit your needs. The domains and pacts listed are the likely choices for clerics, warlocks, and followers of each entity, but these are not the only options, and many other domains can be attributed to your preferred deity. Talk with your DM about how best to dress your domain or pact choice to fit within the philosophies and commandments of your patron deity.

## Prime Deities

The circle of Prime Deities includes the leaders and luminary creators that battled the Primordials and instigated the Founding, forging the mortal races of Exandria. They represent a spectrum of light, protection, love, death, and all other facets of freedom and life in the world. While some gods may disagree and squabble, they exist in a subtle alliance to maintain the sanctity of life and their respective creations.

## Betrayer Gods

The Betrayer Gods are the deities who strayed from the ideals of the Founding and embraced the destructive chaos of the Primordials or grew selfish of their own creations. The Betrayer Gods rarely work together, since they see each other as threats to their own plots and goals. This very weakness allowed the Prime Deities to defeat and banish them, ending the Calamity.

## Lesser Idols

After the banishment of the pantheon in the Divergence, the mortal realm was left to its own devices. Beyond the trickle of divine assistance allowed by the Divine Gate, mortal creatures are now the keepers of the future of Exandria. This vacuum of influence has given rise to a number of powerful entities who may not rival the gods in their abilities or influence, but now unchallenged, can amass a modest following of their own. These idols present themselves in many different ways, some as honorable guardians of the helpless, and others as the tyrannical gods they aspire to be. Many of these beings have ambitions they wish to fulfill and can offer great power to mortals in exchange for their servitude.
