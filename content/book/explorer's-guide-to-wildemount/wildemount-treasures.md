> The difference between power and potential is a curious thing. Everyone seeks to gain power, to use it. Yet the more power you have, the more you use, the more others will try to take it from you. Potential, however, is power unknown, unused. Hidden. Secret until absolutely necessary. I peddle in potential, and I recommend you do too in these times of war.

Since magic was first introduced to mortals in ages past, many have sought to channel the gifts of magic into implements of power. Master crafters and fine artisans have long worked with talented arcanists and divine acolytes to craft beautiful artifacts of protection, or to forge armaments of war. The most skilled archmages enchanted and assembled vast collections of mighty artifacts throughout the Age of Arcanum, most of which were scattered and lost in the conflicts of the Calamity.

Adventurers, archeologists, and unscrupulous explorers delve into dungeons, ruins, and forgotten places of lore in hopes of recovering these objects of power, even as spellcasters and researchers seek to replicate ancient enchantments by their own hands. This chapter contains a collection of new magic items and artifacts found in Wildemount, but which can be used in any campaign setting.

## Magic Items of Wildemount

Whether found in a subterranean tomb while searching for lost treasure, chosen as a reward from a wealthy collector of curiosities, or stumbled across as a discarded object of hidden potential, magic items are always highly sought after by adventurers in a Wildemount campaign. Relics of magic provide a perfect opportunity to bring alive the history of ages long gone, and to reward players for diligently seeking their way in the world.

Many of the magic items in this section are relics of the flying city-state of Aeor, and can often be found in Aeorian ruins in Eiselcross. See chapter 3 for more information on Eiselcross and Aeor.

## Vestiges of Divergence

When the great wars of the Calamity rolled across Exandria, heroes of divinity accepted legendary relics from their patrons and gods. At the same time, archmages wove dangerous arcane power into items of immense magical might. When the war ended, most of these magic items were buried with their wielders beneath ash and dust. Those items that survived were passed down as heirlooms and prized tokens of the past. Whether they survived destruction or have been claimed from the ruins of history, these remnants of a lost era have come to be known as the Vestiges of Divergence.

Each Vestige of Divergence is a magic item that evolves with its wielder. If not attuned to a worthy individual over a prolonged period, such items commonly revert to their **dormant state**. While in this state, a Vestige of Divergence grants an attuned bearer only some of its power. Over time, and in response to perseverance and personal growth, a Vestige of Divergence might unlock facets of its lost capabilities to enter an **awakened state**. Eventually, through extreme personal challenge, evolution, and achievement, these artifacts can reach their ultimate potential in their **exalted state**. The properties and features gained at each new state are cumulative with the properties and features granted at a previous state, unless otherwise noted.

This section presents a number of Vestiges of Divergence that might be found anywhere in Exandria. When Vestiges of Divergence are used in a campaign, their discovery and acquisition should always be treated with a suitable amount of weight and responsibility.

> ### Advancement of a Vestige of Divergence
> 
> Typically, the advancement of a Vestige of Divergence echoes its wielder's own journey of self-discovery, whether that involves triumph or failure. However, a Vestige of Divergence might evolve on its own during moments of duress or desperation for its wielder, granting additional aid in times of need. These moments of advancement are up to the Dungeon Master to identify and enforce, and might manifest in unexpected ways.
> 
> DMs can use the following examples as guidelines for shaping the evolution of a Vestige of Divergence:
> 
> 
> 
> - A character overcomes one of their greatest fears, bravely facing an otherwise paralyzing phobia to save a fellow party member.
> 
> - A character is beaten within an inch of their life by a long-hated foe. In the face of defeat, they feel a deep, dormant strength grow from within.
> 
> - A character loses a close ally in battle, their anguish and fury stirring the power within a Vestige of Divergence.
> 
> - A character discovers a facet of their destiny that guides them toward a dangerous cause. Setting aside their fears, they accept their fate and responsibility.
> 
> - A character successfully takes vengeance against a rival who has long tormented them.
> 
> - A character known for restraint gives in to the amoral, violent urges that a Vestige of Divergence was forged to hone.
> 
> A Vestige of Divergence typically remains dormant until its wielder achieves 9th level. It becomes awakened between levels 9 and 15, and achieves an exalted state between levels 16 and 20. Ultimately, though, this progression is determined by the Dungeon Master.

## Arms of the Betrayers

The Arms of the Betrayers are sentient weapons forged from the souls of fiends by the Betrayer Gods for their humanoid champions. (See "Lesser Idols" in chapter 1 for more details.) These artifacts are more than just magic items. They are powerful sentient beings, filled with fury and eager to be wielded—and to spill blood.

### Betrayer Artifact Properties

The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence (see the previous section). In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.

### Destroying These Artifacts

Destroying any of the Arms of the Betrayers is no easy task. Most conventional means of destruction fail to even scratch one of these ancient artifacts. Each weapon's method of destruction is determined by the DM and should be unique and require at least one adventure to accomplish. The DM can choose or roll for a weapon's method of destruction on the Arms of the Betrayers Destruction table, or use the table as inspiration.

When one of the Arms of the Betrayers is destroyed, the soul of the fiend within the weapon returns to its home plane—and begins to plot the destruction of the creatures responsible.

#### Arms of the Betrayers Destruction

| <span class="text-center block">5</span> | The weapon is destroyed if devoured by Uk'otoa. |
| <span class="text-center block">6</span> | Thrusting the weapon into a <wc-fetch type="item">Luxon beacon</wc-fetch> destroys the weapon and the beacon alike. |
| <span class="text-center block">7</span> | The weapon can be broken only by a blow from another of the Arms of the Betrayers. |
| <span class="text-center block">8</span> | Burning the remains of the first champion to wield the weapon destroys the item. |
