The main figures in any D&D campaign are the characters created by the players. The heroics, folly, righteousness, and potential villainy of your characters are at the heart of the story. This chapter provides a variety of new options for them, focusing on additional subclasses for each of the classes in the player's handbook.

Each class offers a character-defining choice at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level that unlocks a series of special features, not available to the class as a whole. That choice is called a subclass. Each class has a collective term that describes its subclasses; in the fighter, for instance, the subclasses are called martial archetypes, and in the paladin, they're sacred oaths. The table below identifies each of the subclasses in this book. In addition, the section for druids presents details on how the Wild Shape feature works, and the warlock receives a collection of new choices for the class's Eldritch Invocations feature.

Each of the class presentations leads off with advice on how to add depth and detail to your character's personality. You can use the tables in these sections as a source of inspiration, or roll a die to randomly determine a result if desired.

Following the subclasses, the section called "this is your life" presents a series of tables for adding detail to your character's backstory.

The chapter concludes with a selection of feats for the races in the player's handbook, offering ways to delve deeper into a character's racial identity.

## This is Your Life

_Note that an automated version of this exists on the This Is Your Life page._

The character creation rules in the player's handbook provide all the information you need to define your character in preparation for a life of adventuring. What they don't do is account for all the circumstances that shaped your character during the years between your birth and the start of your career as a member of a class.

What did your character accomplish or experience before deciding to become an adventurer? What were the circumstances of your birth? How large is your family, and what sorts of relationships do you have with your relatives? Which people were the greatest influences on you during your formative years, for better or worse?

To answer these questions and more, you can use the tables and the advice in this section to compose a well-developed backstory for your character-an autobiography of sorts-that you can use to inform how you roleplay the character. Your DM can draw from this material as the campaign proceeds, creating situations and scenarios that build off your previous life experiences.

### Ideas, Not Rules

Even though these pages are full of tables and die rolls, they don't make up a rules system-in fact, the opposite is true. You can use as much or as little of this material as you desire, and you can make decisions in any order you want.

For instance, you might not want these tables to help you decide who your parents and siblings are, because that's among the information you've already come up with. But you can still use other parts, such as the section on life events, to provide added depth and detail.

#### How and When to Use the Tables

If you're comfortable with letting the dice decide a certain fact about your character, go ahead and roll. If not, you can take charge and make the decision, choosing from among the possibilities on a table. Of course, you also have the option of disregarding the result of a die roll if it conflicts with another result. Likewise, if the text instructs you to roll on a table, that's not meant to be taken literally. You can always make your own choice.

Although these tables are meant to augment the step-by-step character creation process in the player's handbook, they don't occupy a specific place in that process. You can use some of them early on-for instance, it's possible to determine your parents and other family members immediately after deciding your character's race-but you could also wait until later in the process. You might prefer to establish more facts about your character's game identity-such as your class, ability scores, and alignment-before supplementing that information with what's offered here.

#### Section by Section

This material is divided into four sections, each addressing a different aspect of your character's backstory.

##### Origins

To find out who and where you came from, use the "Origins" section. When you're done, you will have a summary of facts about your parents, your siblings, and the circumstances under which you grew up.

##### Personal Decisions

After you have selected your character's background and class, use the appropriate tables to determine how you came to make those choices.

##### Life Events

Your character's existence until now, no matter how brief or uneventful, has been marked by one or more life events-memorable happenings that have had an effect on who you are today.

##### Supplemental Tables

Your life has intersected with the lives of plenty of other people, all the way from your infancy to today. When a result mentions such a person, you can use the supplemental tables to add needed details-such as race, class, or occupation-to that person. Some tables in the other sections direct you to one or more of the supplemental tables, and you can also use them any other time you see fit.

### Origins

The usual first step in creating your character's life story is to determine your early circumstances. Who were your parents? Where were you born? Did you have any siblings? Who raised you? You can address these questions by using the following tables.

#### Parents

You had parents, of course, even if they didn't raise you. To determine what you know about these people, use the Parents table. If you want, you can roll separately on the table for your mother and your father. Use the supplemental tables as desired (particularly Class, Occupation, and Alignment) to learn more about your parents.

##### Nonhuman Parents

If your character is a half-elf, a half-orc, or a tiefling, you can use one of the tables below to determine the race of each of your parents. When you have a result, randomly determine which part of the result refers to your father and which to your mother.

###### Parents

| <span class="text-center block">d100</span> | Parents |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1-95</span> | You know who your parents are or were. |
| <span class="text-center block">96-100</span> | You do not know who your parents were. |

###### Half-Elf Parents

| <span class="text-center block">d8</span> | Parents |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1-5</span> | One parent was an elf and the other was a human. |
| <span class="text-center block">6</span> | One parent was an elf and the other was a half-elf. |
| <span class="text-center block">7</span> | One parent was a human and the other was a half-elf. |
| <span class="text-center block">8</span> | Both parents were half-elves. |

###### Half-Orc Parents

| <span class="text-center block">d8</span> | Parents |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1-3</span> | One parent was an orc and the other was a human. |

| <span class="text-center block">6-7</span> | One parent was a human and the other was a half-orc. |
| <span class="text-center block">8</span> | Both parents were half-orcs. |

###### Tiefling Parents

| <span class="text-center block">d8</span> | Parents |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1-4</span> | Both parents were humans, their infernal heritage dormant until you came along. |
| <span class="text-center block">5-6</span> | One parent was a tiefling and the other was a human. |
| <span class="text-center block">7</span> | One parent was a tiefling and the other was a devil. |
| <span class="text-center block">8</span> | One parent was a human and the other was a devil. |

#### Birthplace

After establishing your parentage, you can determine where you were born by using the Birthplace table. (Modify the result or roll again if you get a result that's inconsistent with what you know about your parents.) Once you have a result, roll percentile dice. On a roll of 00, a strange event coincided with your birth: the moon briefly turning red, all the milk within a mile spoiling, the water in the area freezing solid in midsummer, all the iron in the home rusting or turning to silver, or some other unusual event of your choice.

##### Birthplace

| <span class="text-center block">d100</span> | Location |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1-50</span> | Home |

| <span class="text-center block">75-77</span> | Temple |
| <span class="text-center block">78</span> | Battlefield |
| <span class="text-center block">79-80</span> | Alley or street |
| <span class="text-center block">81-82</span> | Brothel, tavern, or inn |
| <span class="text-center block">83-84</span> | Castle, keep, tower, or palace |
| <span class="text-center block">85</span> | Sewer or rubbish heap |
| <span class="text-center block">86-88</span> | Among people of a different race |
| <span class="text-center block">89-91</span> | On board a boat or a ship |
| <span class="text-center block">92-93</span> | In a prison or in the headquarters of a secret organization |
| <span class="text-center block">94-95</span> | In a sage's laboratory |
| <span class="text-center block">96</span> | In the Feywild |
| <span class="text-center block">97</span> | In the Shadowfell |
| <span class="text-center block">98</span> | On the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane |
| <span class="text-center block">99</span> | On an Inner Plane of your choice |
| <span class="text-center block">100</span> | On an Outer Plane of your choice |

#### Siblings

You might be an only child or one of many children. Your siblings could be cherished friends or hated rivals. Roll on the Number of Siblings table to determine how many brothers or sisters you have. If you are a dwarf or an elf, subtract 2 from your roll. Then, roll on the Birth Order table for each sibling to determine that person's age relative to yours (older, younger, or born at the same time).

##### Occupation

For each sibling of suitable age, roll on the Occupation supplemental table to determine what that person does for a living.

##### Alignment

You can choose your siblings' alignments or roll on the Alignment supplemental table.

##### Status

By now, each of your siblings might be alive and well, alive and not so well, in dire straits, or dead. Roll on the Status supplemental table.

##### Relationship

You can roll on the Relationship supplemental table to determine how your siblings feel about you. They might all have the same attitude toward you, or some might view you differently from how the others do.

##### Other Details

You can decide any other details you like about each sibling, including gender, personality, and place in the world.

###### Number of Siblings

| <span class="text-center block">d10</span> | Siblings |
| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">1-2</span> | None |
| <span class="text-center block">3-4</span> | <wc-roll>1d3</wc-roll> |
| <span class="text-center block">5-6</span> | <wc-roll>1d4+1</wc-roll> |
| <span class="text-center block">7-8</span> | <wc-roll>1d6+2</wc-roll> |
| <span class="text-center block">9-10</span> | <wc-roll>1d8+3</wc-roll> |

| - | - |
| <span class="text-center block">2</span> | Twin, triplet, or quadruplet |
| <span class="text-center block">3-7</span> | Older |
| <span class="text-center block">8-12</span> | Younger |

#### Family and Friends

Who raised you, and what was life like for you when you were growing up? You might have been raised by your parents, by relatives, or in an orphanage. Or you could have spent your childhood on the streets of a crowded city with only your fellow runaways and orphans to keep you company.

Use the Family table to determine who raised you. If you know who your parents are but you get a result that does not mention one or both of them, use the Absent Parent table to determine what happened.

Next, refer to the Family Lifestyle table to determine the general circumstances of your upbringing. (Chapter 5 of the player's handbook has more information about lifestyles.) The result on that table includes a number that is applied to your roll on the Childhood Home table, which tells you where you spent your early years. Wrap up this section by using the Childhood Memories table, which tells you how you were treated by other youngsters as you were growing up.

##### Supplemental Tables

You can roll on the Relationship table to determine how your family members or other important figures in your life feel about you. You can also use the Race, Occupation, and Alignment tables to learn more about the family members or guardians who raised you. **Developer's Note:** Below you will find a link to a **Story Template** which uses the tables in this and the sections below to randomly determine your back story. Instructions on how to use the template are given in the template itself.

### Personal Decisions

Your character's life takes a particular course depending on the choices you make for the character's background and class.

#### Background

Roll on the appropriate table in this section as soon as you decide your background, or at any later time if you choose. If a background includes a special decision point, such as a folk hero's defining event or the specialty of a criminal or a sage, it's best to make that determination before using the pertinent table below.

##### I became...

| <span class="text-center block">5</span> | A mad old hermit spoke a prophecy when I was born, saying that I would accomplish great things. |

| <span class="text-center block">5</span> | I lost everything-my home, my family, my friends. Going it alone was all I could do. |

### Life Events

No matter how long you've been alive, you have experienced at least one signature event that has markedly influenced your character. Life events include wondrous happenings and tragedies, conflicts and successes, and encounters with the unusual. They can help to explain why your character became an adventurer, and some might still affect your life even after they are long over.

The older a character is, the greater the chance for multiple life events, as shown on the Life Events by Age table. If you have already chosen your character's starting age, see the entry in the Life Events column that corresponds to how old you are. Otherwise, you can roll dice to determine your current age and number of life events randomly.

After you know the number of life events your character has experienced, roll once on the Life Events table for each of them. Many of the results on that table direct you to one of the secondary tables that follow. Once you have determined all of your character's life events, you can arrange them in any chronological order you see fit.

#### Life Events by Age

### What's Next?

When you're finished using these tables, you'll have a collection of facts and notes that-at a minimum-encapsulate what your character has been doing in the world up till now. Sometimes that might be all the information you want, but you don't have to stop there.

By using your creativity to stitch all these bits together into a continuous narrative, you can create a full-fledged autobiography for your character in as little as a few sentences-an excellent example of how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Did you get a couple of results on the tables that don't outright contradict each other but also don't seem to fit together smoothly? If so, now is your chance to explain what happened to you. For instance, let's say you were born in a castle, but your childhood home was in the wilderness. It could be that your parents traveled from their forest home to seek help from a midwife at the castle when your mother was close to giving birth. Or your parents might have been members of the castle's staff before you were born, but they were released from service soon after you came into the world.

In addition to deepening your own roleplaying experience, your character's history presents your DM with opportunities to weave those elements into the story of the campaign. Any way you look at it, adding definition to your character's pre-adventuring life is time well spent.

## Racial Feats

Leveling up in a class is the main way a character evolves during a campaign. Some DMs also allow the use of feats to customize a character. Feats are an optional rule in chapter 6, "Customization Options," of the player's handbook. The DM decides whether they're used and may also decide that some feats are available in a campaign and others aren't.

This section introduces a collection of special feats that allow you to explore your character's race further. These feats are each associated with a race from the Player's Handbook, as summarized in the Racial Feats table. A racial feat represents either a deepening connection to your race's culture or a physical transformation that brings you closer to an aspect of your race's lineage.

The cause of a particular transformation is up to you and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a latent quality that has emerged as you age, or a transformation might be the result of an event in the campaign, such as exposure to powerful magic or visiting a place of ancient significance to your race. Transformations are a fundamental motif of fantasy literature and folklore. Figuring out why your character has changed can be a rich addition to your campaign's story.
