Heroes come in many shapes and sizes. This chapter presents character races that are some of the more distinctive race options in the D&D multiverse. They supplement the options in the _Player's Handbook_ and are more rare in the worlds of D&D than the races in that book are.

If you're a player, consult with your DM before using any of the races here. Many DMs like to consider the implications for their world before adding a new race. Your DM may say yes or no to you using a race or may modify it in some way.

The following races are detailed in this chapter: **Aasimar** are humanoids with an angelic spark in their souls, which grants them supernatural power. **Firbolgs** are forest guardians who prefer peaceful methods to protect their homes but take up arms if they must. **Goliaths** are hulking wanderers who dwell at the highest mountain reaches. **Kenku** are cursed bird folk, who still pay the price for an ancient betrayal. Dwelling in human cities, they have a sinister reputation for working as criminals. **Lizardfolk** sometimes venture from their swamp homes in search of treasure and glory. Inscrutable to their mammalian companions, they prove to be stout allies. **Tabaxi** are curious cat folk, who have journeyed from their distant homeland in search of interesting treasures and lore. **Tritons** are guardians of the ocean depths, who sometimes join people on land in the battle against evil.

The chapter also includes a section of monstrous character options that a DM can add to a campaign: **bugbear, goblin, hobgoblin, kobold, orc, and ** **yuan-ti pureblood,** the stories of which are explored in chapter 1.

At the end of the chapter is a section that you can use to determine the height and weight of a character who is a member of one of the races in this chapter.

If you're the DM, including any of these races in your campaign is a storytelling opportunity, a chance for you to decide the roles that different peoples play in the tales you weave. You might decide that a race in this chapter is common in your world, that only a few members of it still live, or that it doesn't exist at all. Whatever you decide about the races, consider how they can enhance your stories.

## Height and Weight

You may roll for your character's height and weight on the Random Height and Weight table. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character's base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight.
