Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as <wc-fetch type="condition">blinded</wc-fetch>, are impairments, but a few, such as <wc-fetch type="condition">invisible</wc-fetch>, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the <wc-fetch type="condition">prone</wc-fetch> condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:
