<p>This chapter provides a toolbox to help the Dungeon Master create adventures featuring the guilds of Ravnica. The tensions among the guilds, a constant current of animosity, provide a solid foundation for building adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Krenko&rsquo;s Way&rdquo; can be used to launch a Ravnica campaign.</p>
<p>The tables and advice in this chapter expand on the material in chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. Monsters and nonplayer characters mentioned on the tables can be found either in the Monster Manual or in chapter 6 of this book. When a creature&rsquo;s name appears in bold type, that&rsquo;s a visual cue pointing you to the creature&rsquo;s stat block in the Monster Manual. If the stat block appears elsewhere, the text tells you so.</p>

Any of these sites can serve as the location for an adventure.</p>
<p>The description of each guild location includes a table that lists possible goals for an adventure based there. You can choose an adventure goal, or roll one randomly, from the table in the description of the site you&rsquo;ve chosen. If none of those goals inspires you, choose a goal or roll one randomly from the Guild Location Goals table instead.</p>

<p>Certain kinds of goals and schemes are common to villains in every guild. Some generic villainous schemes appear on the Guild Villains table. You can also use the Villain&rsquo;s Scheme and Villain&rsquo;s Methods tables in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide to flesh out a villain&rsquo;s activities, and a guild&rsquo;s section in this chapter points to specific parts of those tables that characterize how villains from that guild enact their plans.</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose a guild that has an aesthetic or a story that excites you and that will lead to the sort of villain or type of adventure you want to build. The following section, &ldquo;Adventure Types,&rdquo; shows how different guilds are natural fits for certain types of adventure.</li>
<li>Pick a guild that fits your players' tastes. The introduction to the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide offers some guidance for crafting adventures to please different kinds of players. The guild or guilds your players choose will also help you understand your players' desires. It&rsquo;s a safe bet that a player who creates a Rakdos character is looking for mayhem and combat, while a Dimir player is more interested in intrigue and sabotage. Armed with that understanding, you can better craft an adventure experience aimed at your players.</li>
<li>Go with a guild that easily provides a villain to face. A few guilds make very straightforward villains: Gruul, Rakdos, Dimir, and Golgari.</li>
<li>Let a die decide the guild, using the Random Guilds table in this book&rsquo;s introduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guild you choose will provide a potential location, villain, mission, or adventure hook, as well as point you toward the type of adventure you&rsquo;re going to run.</p>

<li>
<p>Choose a guild (or use the Guilds table in chapter 1 if you want to choose randomly). The adventure will take place in that guild&rsquo;s location, as described in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the adventure goal using the table associated with that location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use creatures associated with the guild (shown on the tables in chapter 6) to populate the location.

<p>Certain guilds lend themselves to particular types of adventures better than others, as shown below. If you&rsquo;re interested in running an intrigue adventure, where the heroes must unravel twisted plots within plots, you&rsquo;ll want to choose a different guild from what you would select if you want to run a dungeon delve that will take the adventurers into the labyrinthine undercity.</p>

Indeed, thousands of years of development have buried countless layers of construction beneath the current surface streets, making the undercity much larger than the surface city, though much of it is inaccessible. But if a sinkhole or other catastrophe opens long-sealed vaults and exposes them to the surface again, who knows what horrors might be revealed?</p>

If you choose a villain from a guild that&rsquo;s already in conflict with one or more guilds that the characters belong to, it&rsquo;s easy to craft villainous goals that are at odds with the characters' goals.</p>
<p>If all the player characters belong to a single guild, choosing almost any other guild will provide opportunities for conflict. The natural state of the relationship between any two guilds is tension at best, and open warfare at worst. All it takes is a villain willing to upset the balance of power, and the characters' guild or their own motivations should easily bring them into conflict with the villain. A party&rsquo;s own guild could even provide a villain, given the amount of scheming and intrigue that exists even within the guilds. A guild official gone rogue, members of the same guild at odds with one another, or even a corrupt guildmaster can put characters in conflict with their own guild.</p>
<p>If the characters come from different guilds, a common enemy provides a good reason for them to work together. Any guild that isn&rsquo;t represented by one of the characters is a fine choice for a villain.</p>

The answer could be as simple as a guildmaster or other authority sending them on a mission, but it&rsquo;s generally good to hook the characters in personally. What motivation do they have to thwart the villain?</p>
<p>The best answers to this question stem either from the adventurers' personalities, ideals, and histories, or from their guild affiliations. The characters might have a common reason to fight the villain (especially if they all belong to the same guild or have been adventuring together for a while), or they might all oppose the villain for different reasons.</p>
<p>For example, say your villain is a group of Gruul anarchs raiding in a densely populated area. A Boros character might be assigned to protect innocent bystanders, or might just happen to be in the area and leap to the defense of the innocents. An Izzet character might be trying to make sure that an Izzet laboratory in the area isn&rsquo;t damaged or its secrets looted. A Dimir spy might leap at the opportunity to steal some Izzet secrets when the laboratory comes under attack.</p>
<p>The Cross Purposes table can help you involve the characters in an adventure by suggesting ways that a villain&rsquo;s activities might directly conflict with the player characters' goals or interests.</p>

<p>The involvement of a second guild can be as simple as the appearance of a bumbling innocent who needs the characters' protection, or as complex as a second villain who pursues an entirely separate scheme. The Secondary Guild Role table presents a range of options.</p>

<p>A friendly contact can act as a patron, sending a character on a mission or a side quest either as a formal assignment or as a favor. Friendly contacts also have a knack for getting into perilous situations from which they need to be rescued, which can sometimes force characters into making difficult choices between saving friendly nonplayer characters and capturing villainous ones. In extraordinary circumstances, a friendly contact might even join the adventuring party for a short time.</p>
<p>Contacts who have a more antagonistic relationship with a character can hinder the adventuring party&rsquo;s efforts in a variety of ways. They might appear at inconvenient times to delay the party, or catch the group in the midst of some illegal activity. They might leak information to the adventure&rsquo;s villain, subtly aid the villain&rsquo;s efforts, or even become villains themselves.</p>
<p>Contacts can complicate things even more when they interact with multiple player characters or with each other. Consider what might happen when two people who are friendly contacts for two different characters are bitter enemies of each other, or when a single NPC is a good friend of one character and a rival of another. The characters might have to navigate those complex relationships in order to achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Adventures involving the Azorius Senate naturally revolve around law enforcement. Player characters who find themselves on the wrong side of the law might be forced to confront well-meaning Azorius arresters as enemies, even if the characters are innocent of any wrongdoing. Lawful characters might also assist the Azorius in maintaining law and order on the mean streets of Ravnica.</p>

One end of the station includes a courthouse (the lower level) and a prison (upper level).</p>
<p>Wide, impressive stairs lead to the main courthouse entrance, which opens into a large waiting room. All the doors leading out of the waiting room are kept locked, so they can be opened only from the other side. To either side of the waiting room are private meeting rooms, which lead back to an extensive area of offices for the large staff that keeps the place running.</p>
<p>The twin courtrooms include bench seats for spectators and witnesses. The judges preside from platforms that hover in midair, with shallow pools of water below. The accused are seated on balconies that overlook the same pools. Doors at the back of these balconies lead to a central hallway that ends at a staircase that ascends to the prison level.</p>
<p>Direct access to the prison area from outside the building is provided by two long, narrow staircases that lead up from the plaza. The stairs end at a balcony that is guarded at all times by archers behind arrow slits. A narrow hall leads through several locked doors to the cellsâ€”the general population on one side, where prisoners are allowed to mingle to some extent, and a high-security area on the other side, featuring smaller cells keeping prisoners in complete isolation.</p>
<p>The opposite end of the station is a headquarters for a local detachment of arresters. The main level includes two meeting rooms, an office for the commander, and a break room. The upper level provides working space where arresters can interview suspects and complete paperwork, as well as space for storing evidence. The lower level includes a morgue and a large area where the whole local force can be assembled.</p>

A local magistrate might imprison innocent people, or the senate might pass oppressive legislation, thereby drawing the ire of the Boros and the Selesnya, who care about the folk who get caught in the crosshairs. Arresters might decide to crack down on unsafe Izzet laboratory practices, illegal Rakdos performances, or the Gruul presence in the city. Self-righteous prison wardens or precinct captains might abuse their authority in the name of the law, and corrupt bureaucrats might use their positions to garner favors for themselves and their relatives.</p>
<p>Low-level characters might suffer harassment at the hands of overzealous arresters. As the campaign progresses, they might be able to identify a particular imperator who is driving this heightened aggression, who then becomes something of a nemesis for them. As they gain experience, this imperator continues to be a thorn in their side and advances through the ranks of the senate as well, becoming a minister and eventually the arbiter who dictates law enforcement policy for the entire guild. Along the way, this villain uses every available means to hinder the characters, probably veering into covert illegal activities (evil means for a good end). The climax of the campaign might involve a violent confrontation with this arbiter and a group of arresters, or a tense verbal argument adjudicated by Supreme Judge Isperia herself.</p>

Two antechambers give the Boros soldiers and angels ample opportunity to screen anyone who seeks to gain entrance. Beyond them is a large hall where troops can be mustered. To one side of the mustering hall is a barracks area, with a kitchen, a mess, food storage, and guest quarters on the other side.</p>
<p>An extensive array of wall niches in the lower tier (at street level) provides storage space for archived records and the like, and a basement beneath that includes food storage and a well for fresh water, enabling the garrison to withstand a long siege.</p>
<p>The upper tier includes more large halls, the commander&rsquo;s quarters and office, and several nichesâ€”accessible only by flying from outside the garrisonâ€”that serve as living quarters and watch-posts for the angels stationed here. Parapets on the rooftop provide cover for humanoid archers as well, and the broad open space that they surround offers room for training and sparring. Grass-covered ridges separate different training areas and add a contrasting touch of nature&rsquo;s beauty to the otherwise stony building.</p>

Although the current guildmaster, Aurelia, has reversed her stance on the issue, some voices within the legion still espouse these views. Boros villains are typically intolerant, self-righteous warmongers who abuse their power in pursuit of their own private visions of justice. And because the lower echelons of the guild are taught to follow orders without question, even the villains among the Boros can command companies of soldiers to help them carry out their schemes.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span></p>
<p>Boros villains are inclined to engage in activity that involves pursuing one&rsquo;s passion, acquiring power, or exacting retribution. The Boros make good campaign antagonists if the adventurers represent the forces of chaos that the legion opposesâ€”Rakdos revelers, Gruul raiders, Golgari corrupters, or Dimir spies.</p>
<p>You could structure a campaign around the legion&rsquo;s slow progress in taking over the authority of the Azorius Senate and imposing a sort of martial law on the city. A campaign of this sort is particularly effective if the characters initially work alongside the Boros, especially if one or more characters belong to the legion. They might help Boros soldiers drive off Gruul raiders or uproot Dimir spiesâ€”clearly fighting against evil on the side of the good and just. As time goes on, though, their Boros allies might start taking their war against evil too far. Innocent citizens get caught in the crossfire, most punishment is cruel and excessive, and any resistance is met with overwhelming force, to &ldquo;set an example&rdquo; for anyone else who might consider opposing the legion. A Boros ally (or even a close friend) of the characters might become fully caught up in this fervor. Perhaps the characters can talk some sense into their old friend, but the resolution of the campaign might force them to take more extreme measures to curb the legion&rsquo;s excesses.</p>

These sites are protected by magical wards that confuse and misdirect all who approachâ€”in particular, spells that make intruders forget where they are or what they&rsquo;re doing there.</p>
<p>A safe house can also be used to hold prisoners for interrogation, with its protections equally effective in preventing escape and in deterring intruders. Often, a single site serves both purposes.</p>

Most people who have been to a safe house or its environs have no memory of the event, thanks to Dimir mind magic.</p>
<p>The Safe House Adventures table offers some reasons why characters might need to visit such a location. In addition, you could use any other guild&rsquo;s sample location as the site for a location-based adventure, with a simple mission: uncover a Dimir spy in that location.</p>

The ground level is a comfortable living space that features accommodations for at least five people. It has five bedrooms, abundant storage space, a central lounge, a recreation space, a dining room, a kitchen, and a pantry.</p>
<p>A secret door in the back of a shared closet leads to a spiral staircase that descends to the basement, which contains three small holding cells. A watch post at the end of the hall allows a guard to keep an eye on the cells and anyone coming down the stairs. An interrogation room can be outfitted with equipment designed to extract information. One-way mirrors offer a view on the interrogation proceedings from an observation room.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The safe house is underground and accessible only through a maze of tunnels and crevices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The area surrounding the house is protected by a guards and wards spell. Navigating the ancient underground corridors or the modern alleyways above ground becomes more complicated when intersections are clouded by fog, doors are hidden and magically locked, and magical compulsions drive visitors away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A glyph of warding might cast fear, phantasmal force, or crown of madness on a character who triggers itâ€”or simply explode in a blast of cold energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dimir agents might use alarm spells to ensure that they know when intruders are approaching the safe house.</p>

<p>Dimir villains favor schemes involving captivity and coercion, defamation, impersonation and disguise, murder, politics, theft, and torture. Perhaps the most insidious technique employed by the Dimir is the erasing and modifying of memories.</p>
<p>Because their tendrils reach into every other guild, Dimir villains could turn out to be the link between plots that initially seem to be unconnected. Even when individual missions might be straightforward dungeon crawls or battles in the streets, the campaign revolves around the mystery of determining the true villain.</p>
<p>At low and middle levels, the characters might find themselves engaged in important but apparently unrelated tasks. They might kill or drive off a monster that is lairing in an abandoned arrester station (unwittingly clearing the way for a Dimir agent to be placed in the station). They might help the Boros capture a dangerous Rakdos ringleader (who is actually a Dimir agent working to destabilize Azorius influence). They might unmask a Dimir spy within one of their own guilds (who is an internal rival of the Dimir villain).</p>
<p>As the characters advance in level, they might come to realize that a powerful and ambitious Azorius figure is going too far in spying on the populace, despite that guild&rsquo;s great success in using precognitive mages to arrest evildoersâ€”especially Dimir spies. Ultimately, the Azorius villain is revealed to be a high-ranking Dimir agent, a confidant of Lazav or even Lazav himself, who is trying to take over the Azorius Senate and turn it into a surveillance and espionage organization under the villain&rsquo;s control.</p>

A bridge crosses just above it, and a wide, curving stair leads down from the bridge to the grand ballroom on the top level of the mansion. The rest of the structure is built down from there, with the main, elegant halls and parlors on the second level. Notably, a wide hallway on this level connects with a passage leading to other areas of the undercity. A couple of areas on this floor have crumbled with the weight of the ages, but the place retains its stately grandeur.</p>
<p>The bottom level might be a basement excavated in the floor of a chasm, or it could hang above still more open space like a giant stalactite. It includes living quarters for the owners, servants, and guests.</p>

Because they consider life and death as equal parts of the natural cycle, they have no qualms about subjecting entire neighborhoods to poisonous gas or strangling vines to achieve their various goals. When a Golgari assassin goes on a killing spree, when a patch of their vegetative growth begins &ldquo;reclaiming&rdquo; an area that isn&rsquo;t yet abandoned, or when their fungus-bearing zombies emerge from the undercity to haunt the city streets, heroes are duty bound to act against the threat.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span></p>
<p>The Golgari possess a combination of ambition and ruthlessness that makes them extremely dangerous adversaries. The tension among the various factions of the swarm (the elves, the medusas, the kraul, and the rising erstwhile) adds an element of instability to the mix. But perhaps the Golgari Swarm&rsquo;s most dangerous quality is the widespread confidence among its members that it will survive any catastrophe that might befall the surface world. This certainty means Golgari villains will stop at nothing in an attempt to provoke such an eventâ€”triggering a virulent plague, causing explosive plant growth, or inciting the other guilds into open war, for example. Over the course of a campaign, a group of adventurers might foil Golgari plans to accomplish all these things, or the characters might be constantly struggling against one ongoing disaster.</p>
<p>For example, the characters might spend the early part of the campaign resolving disputes between guilds, unaware that the Golgari are actually the instigators of those conflicts. Perhaps incidental to these missions, they also face a spore druid who is in the early stages of testing a terrible plague. Then, as the campaign reaches higher levels, the plague breaks out again, this time spreading rapidly. The crisis heightens tensions among the other guilds, especially when food sources are threatened. At the climax of the campaign, the heroes must defuse conflict among the guilds while finding a way to get at the druid at the cause of it all, who is locked in an undercity mansion waiting out the catastrophe.</p>

The secretive agents of the Ochran are more likely to pursue goals that call for theft or even assassination, while shamans could participate in the swarm&rsquo;s work of &ldquo;reclamation&rdquo; in surface neighborhoods. The Golgari Assignments table reflects this range of possibilities. An assignment can also serve as a side quest for Golgari adventurers to undertake while pursuing a larger goal with a mixed-guild party.</p>

<p>An adventure involving the Gruul Clans typically revolves around combat. The Gruul provide characters with opportunities to fight huge monsters and vicious berserkers. The Gruul bring chaos and destruction with them wherever they go, so they can easily disrupt and complicate adventures involving any other guild. Any time an adventure needs an injection of brutal violence, the Gruul are a good tool for the purpose.</p>

An old tower is the one intact structure the Gruul use, because it offers a good vantage point over the surrounding area. A sluiceway provides potable water, and a handful of scraggly trees are a reminder of nature&rsquo;s potential to grow and flourish even among the ruins.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the camp is little more than a handful of tents around a bonfire. A trash pit serves as a means of waste disposal, a few makeshift cages can hold prisoners, and a partially enclosed area to one side has been converted into a pen for the beasts used by the Gruul.</p>

<p>At low levels, characters could be drawn into seemingly coincidental clashes with the Gruul, perhaps as minor events in adventures that involve other guilds. Only later does a pattern emerge: the raids correspond with certain astronomical events, the movements of wurms, or another sign that the druids of the Old Ways consider significant. As the adventurers' power grows, so does that of the Gruul druids behind the trouble, and soon the druids are actually instigating natural disastersâ€”earthquakes and mighty storms, for example. As the campaign reaches its climax, the Gruul Clans all come together to perform an enormous ritual meant to summon the Raze-Boar and bring an end to civilization on Ravnicaâ€”and the adventurers must stop it.</p>

<p>The fundamental responsibility of the Izzet League is building and maintaining Ravnica&rsquo;s infrastructure, and the guild&rsquo;s work is responsible for many of the magicalâ€“technological conveniences that make life in the city relatively safe and comfortable, from paved roadways to running water. Under the leadership of the draconic genius Niv-Mizzet, the Izzet have continued to innovate, taking their work far beyond the essential needs of infrastructure and into the realm of wild invention. As a result, the workshops and laboratories of the Izzet are prone to magical mishaps, with results that range from personal injury to district-wide destruction. It is perhaps best for Ravnica as a whole that most of Izzet&rsquo;s work takes place in small workshops scattered throughout the city, rather than being concentrated in one place (with the guildhall of Nivix being the notable exception).</p>

A mana generator in the basement fuels all the experimentation and construction above. The generator draws power from the city infrastructure, and ultimately from the Blistercoils, but the construction depicted in map 4.6 is designed to amplify and focus the magical energy. The machinery is fragile, so visitors are strongly discouraged from entering the basement.</p>
<p>Some parts of the generator extend up to the ground floor and the laboratory mezzanine above it, with portions of those floors open to the basement or covered only by metal grates. The ground level is typically cluttered with devices attached to the generator below, as well as cast-off pieces of such devices, awaiting new homes in new inventions. The laboratory mezzanine includes three spaces where projects can be developed in isolation, with thick walls providing some shielding from potentially explosive results. Additional equipment related to the generator system is housed in a tower and on the workshop&rsquo;s roof, culminating in a storm siphon that can harness and channel atmospheric energy (including lightning).</p>
<p>The Bizarre Magical Effects table provides suggestions for the sort of events that might result from a failed (or successful!) Izzet experiment, which can add spice to any Izzet adventure.</p>

Out of madness or despair, they might plot the destruction of precincts or districts. Hungry for profit and power, they develop weapons capable of destroying large groups of people and commit crimes to get the resources they need to complete their research.</p>

<p>At low levels, the characters might help deal with a small-scale mishap in an Izzet workshop that is presumed to be an accident. Maybe something in the manner of the responsible researcher stirs up their suspicion, but there&rsquo;s no evidence of wrongdoing at this point. As the campaign progresses, the characters might continue having run-ins with the same researcher, whose work seems to be growing more dangerous. Eventually, they discover evidence that this researcher is developing weapons to use against the other guilds, and as a result the researcher has to move to a secret workshop, perhaps tucked away in the undercity. Or perhaps the guildmaster intervenes, declares this issue to be an internal matter for the Izzet to resolve, and assures the authorities that the researcher will be properly dealt with. As the campaign reaches its climax, the adventurers are tasked with discovering the researcher&rsquo;s secret laboratory and disabling the super-weapon.</p>

The nave features lofty archways, towering statues of proud oligarchs, and a huge central statue that depicts the Ghost Council surrounded by supplicants. A pair of tall doors behind the statue leads to a sanctuary where minor treasuresâ€”worth more than most citizens will ever see in their lives, but less than the true treasures hidden in the vaultsâ€”are put on display to encourage devotion. Another statue of a patron oligarch (usually the basilica&rsquo;s founder) stands at the end of this room, flanked by spiral staircases leading up into the spire and down to the crypts. The stairs are secured behind ornate wrought iron gates.</p>
<p>The three levels of the spire hold luxurious apartments where living oligarchs dwell. The doors can be locked from the outside, making them also suitable for holding valuable prisoners.</p>
<p>The crypts and vaults below the basilica hold the bones of ancient oligarchs and their most cherished treasures. Some crypts contain just bones, others just valuables, and some hold both. A security station keeps watch on the entire level, and the guards there are typically the only ones who have keys to open the metal portcullises that obstruct the hallway.</p>

Their favorite methods include coercion, confidence scams (mostly relying on the fine print in magically binding contracts), murder, politics, theft, torture, and vice.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span></p>
<p>You could build a campaign around the Orzhov Syndicate&rsquo;s efforts to gain control of the adventurers. Recognizing the characters as powerful agents for change, one or more pontiffs scheme to make sure that the syndicate can direct that force toward goals of their choosing. In typical Orzhov fashion, that generally means trying to force the characters into debt, either to the Orzhov in general or to an individual pontiff.</p>
<p>At low levels, the Orzhov might be nothing more than a gentle force behind the scenes. If the adventurers need help, an Orzhov agent might appear and offer it. If they commit crimes, the Orzhov find out about it. The characters' valuables can be kept safe in an Orzhov vault, and Orzhov ministrants can provide healing and other clerical magic at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>As the campaign progresses and the characters acquire more influence in their guilds and in the city at large, the Orzhov begin trying to exert pressure. They call in favors in exchange for the help they have previously offered, they make subtle threats about reporting the adventurers' illegal acts, or they point to the fine print in agreements made with the ministrants. Initially, their motives might not be outwardly sinister. (The Orzhov Assignments table can serve as inspiration.) But if the characters work against Orzhov interests, the syndicate interferes more forcefully. All the while, Orzhov leaders are looking for ways to trap the characters under their ghostly thumbs.</p>
<p>As the campaign builds to a climax, the adventurers might be forced to make sacrifices in order to throw off the yoke of Orzhov debt. That turn of events could lead to a confrontation with an undead pontiff or even the entire Obzedat. And if a member of the adventuring party has died along the way, the other characters might find themselves fighting the spirit of their dead companion!</p>

<p>On most worlds, a cult dedicated to an ancient demon lord would be an obvious villain, to be rooted out and exterminated at all costs. On Ravnica, though, the status of the Cult of Rakdos isn&rsquo;t so clear-cut. It is a guild like the others, and its existence is mandated by the Guildpact, so exterminating it and its founder would violate the fundamental social order of the world. Although the ranks of Rakdos include outright villains who crave blood and mayhem, most of its members are performers who just want to put on a good show. Not every performance ends in violence, and even when a riot does break out, it&rsquo;s not always easy to pin the blame on the entertainers.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Cult of Rakdos has more than its share of truly villainous members, and the guild provides ample opportunity for adventurers to fight against true evil.</p>

Visitors are channeled through a large entry vestibule into an upper area with tables tucked away in nooks. From there, they can watch the violent antics of ferocious beasts or performers in cages suspended from the ceiling. Stairs lead down to the area of the main stage, where headlining performances are held. Offices and storage areas fill the rest of the main level.</p>
<p>A second stage in the lower level provides a more up-close experience, which often means audience members are showered in blood or drawn into the show. Several private booths surround the backstage area, with doors that include shuttered windows to enable those inside to keep an eye on the show or carry out private business.</p>

Most of them are driven by a desire for unfettered mayhem. A hunger for a certain form of immortality (being an artist who is remembered forever) often feeds that desire, and insofar as Rakdos can be considered the &ldquo;god&rdquo; of his cult, objectives related to magicâ€”carrying out his wishes, offering him sacrifices, and rousing him into actionâ€”are also significant objectives for some cultists. Driven as they are by selfish impulse and emotion, Rakdos villains also sometimes pursue schemes related to passion, power, or revenge. Specific examples appear on the Rakdos Villains table.</p>

The campaign might unfold amid steadily increasing violence, escalating to episodes of widespread rioting and rampaging demons.</p>
<p>At lower levels, the adventurers might encounter incidental violence spilling over from Rakdos venues: a brawl outside a nightclub, overenthusiastic devils spreading fires around a street stage, or the &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; death of a few performers at the climax of their act. As the campaign progresses, the characters might be drawn into combating the efforts of blood witches who are trying to exterminate the cult&rsquo;s most active enemies. The more they foil the cult&rsquo;s efforts, the more the characters themselves become targets of both ridicule and violent action.</p>
<p>At the campaign&rsquo;s climax, the adventurers might have to interrupt a ritual performed in Rakdos&rsquo;s lair in order to prevent him from rampaging through the cityâ€”or if they are too late to do that, they might have to fight the ancient demon lord himself.</p>

It is a natural home for player charactersâ€”especially clerics and druidsâ€”so it might serve as a patron.

From the outside, a vernadi might resemble a peaceful commune, and thus seem to be an easy target for theft or assault. But its temple gardens are protected by soldiers and archers, and even the seemingly serene initiates have some military training.</p>

A circle of white marble with several archways surrounds the base of the tree, encompassing both a decorative garden where meetings are held and a vegetable garden that provides food for the vernadi. The meeting garden includes benches and a fountain of fresh water. Two small buildings at ground level offer rustic accommodations for members of the vernadi or guests.</p>
<p>Gracefully curving ramps sweep around the trunk of the tree, leading to various other small buildings. Several of these are open to the air, offering sheltered places for gatherings or quiet contemplation. Others are apartments where leaders of the vernadi live. Near the top of the tree is a large, round temple space.</p>

<p>At lower levels, Selesnya might be an ally to the player characters, offering support in the form of healing and other magic. By the time the characters reach middle levels, Selesnya emerges as a threat: perhaps it becomes clear that several vernadi are using magical charms (or other forms of coercion) to win converts, and the conclave might even try to coerce the player characters to join. Eventually, their strategy evolves toward extortion and conquest, as they unleash wurms and similar powerful beasts to threaten those who refuse to convert, and they use the might of their armies to eliminate other guilds and bring whole precincts under their control. The climax of the campaign might involve the heroes leading or coordinating the efforts of all nine other guilds to unite against the Selesnya threat.</p>

It might be built on the inside wall of a zonot or a chasm, or it could abut another building at street level. The chamber consists of a series of overlapping domes with large, green-tinted windows.</p>
<p>The main entrance leads into a lobby with three decorative pools and three functional growth pods showcasing the most innocuous research being done here. The pods are glass and metal devices filled with greenish, vaguely glowing liquid, designed to allow life forms to gestate and grow until they are ready to emerge. The pods might be growing homunculi or category 1 krasis, but it would be highly unusual for the Simic to display the maturation of a hybrid soldier in such a public way. Four smaller growth pods to one side serve the same function. On the other side, a meeting room (containing one more growth pod) offers a place for researchers to meet with outsiders.</p>
<p>The first level above the main floor is dedicated to living, cooking, and eating space for the researchers and others who live here. A single large room acts as a barracks for the scientists, with folding screens offering some degree of privacy.</p>
<p>The other levels of the chamber are entirely dedicated to research and space to grow the laboratory&rsquo;s creations. Growth pods are found in nearly every room.</p>

Thus, villains among their number are often those who seek to provoke the war they have foreseen, or those who go to extraordinary, unethical, or illegal lengths to conduct their work.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the campaign, the adventurers might face Simic-related threats such as rogue hybrids and rampaging krasis, which seem to be unrelated to each other and more or less accidental. As the campaign progresses, it becomes clear that these Simic creatures are part of a military build-up. The wrath of the other guilds turns toward the combine, but this conflict is exactly what the guild has been preparing for. Ultimately, it falls to the characters to either prevent the war, disable the Simic creatures that are poised to obliterate the other guilds' armies, or find another course of action that can maintain the balance of power in Ravnica.</p>
