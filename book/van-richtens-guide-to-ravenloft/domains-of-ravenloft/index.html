<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>In a far-flung corner of the Plane of Shadow drifts a hidden expanse of roiling mist and vague semi-reality. At this eerie edge of the multiverse, the Dark Powers collect the most wicked beings from across ages and worlds within inescapable, mist-shrouded domains. These are the Domains of Dread, the nightmare demiplanes that form the D&D setting of Ravenloft. Untold terrors lurk within these lands, yet the collection of the Dark Powers is far from complete.</p>
<p>This chapter provides information for the DM and explores the misty truths of the Domains of Dread, along with a sampling of the terrifying domains, dreaded Darklords, and daring wanderers trapped in the Dark Powers' clutches.</p>

The following sections detail how the Dark Powers manipulate the Land of the Mists, and what domain inhabitants accept as the ways of their world (or desperately avoid pondering).</p>
<h3 id=the-mists>
<a href=#the-mists class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Mists</h3><p>The Mists can always be found at a domain&rsquo;s borders but can also appear in dense banks that rise wherever adventures demand. Such banks might veil strangers or hidden foes, or they can transport those who enter them to distant lands, other domains, or even beyond the Domains of Dread. The Mists are inscrutable, but they ever serve the schemes of the Dark Powers, delivering creatures wherever these wicked forces desire.</p>
<p>The Dark Powers also grant Darklords limited ability to manipulate the Mists surrounding their domains, allowing most to open or close their domains' borders to others on a whim. If a domain&rsquo;s borders are closed, supernatural agitation is obvious to any who approach the Mists. This takes the form of roiling disturbances within the haze, menacing silhouettes, threatening sounds, or other activity themed to the Darklord or domain. Creatures that enter the Mists at this time, including flying creatures, are subject to the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A creature that starts its turn in the Mists must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>. This <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> can&rsquo;t be removed while the creature is in the Mists.</li>
<li>No matter how far a creature travels in the Mists, or which direction it goes, it gets turned around so that it eventually ends up back in the domain it left.</li>
<li>The area within the Mists is heavily obscured (see the Player&rsquo;s Handbook for details).</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Darklords can keep their domains' borders closed indefinitely and can reopen them at will. For some Darklords, slightly varied effects manifest when they close their domains. Others are limited in their ability to affect their borders. For each domain, specifics appear in the &ldquo;Closing the Borders&rdquo; portion of the section on that domain&rsquo;s Darklord.</p>
<p>If a domain&rsquo;s borders are open, the domain is still not easy to escape from. The area within the Mists remains heavily obscured, but the Mists don&rsquo;t cause creatures to gain levels of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>. Characters intent on passing through the Mists travel for <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> hours, then roll on the Wandering the Mists table to determine what happens.</p>

By holding the talisman and focusing on its domain of origin, a creature in the Mists can reach that domain after <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> hours of travel. Any creatures that willingly follow the creature with the Mist talisman also reach the same destination. A Mist talisman is no help to a creature imprisoned within a domain&rsquo;s closed borders. If the borders of the destination domain are closed, roll on the Wandering the Mists table to determine what happens.</p>
<p>Mist talismans take ominous forms, and no two are alike. A family&rsquo;s burned holy book, a battered stuffed toy, a papyrus scroll, or any of the items on the <wc-fetch type=item>Horror Trinket</wc-fetch> in chapter 1 might serve as Mist talismans. Few who dwell in the Domains of Dread know how to use Mist talismans or have interest in traveling to other domains. Those who do, though, might share a Mist talisman with adventurers or could know where such an item is located. You can use Mist talismans to guide characters from one domain to another as your adventures require.</p>
<p>The domains detailed in this chapter suggest Mist talismans that can be used to reach them, but these aren&rsquo;t exhaustive lists. Use them as inspiration for Mist talismans of your own design.</p>

<p>The Dark Powers manipulate the domains and creatures within their grasp in the most fundamental ways, controlling magic, the nature of life and death, and the means of escaping from their nightmare realms.</p>
<h4 id=mysterious-magic>
<a href=#mysterious-magic class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Mysterious Magic</h4><p>In some domains, magic is an everyday part of life, while in others, insular communities fear it as the province of monsters. Few domains deny magic entirely or outlaw its use, but magic might be rare beyond the spellcasting of local healers or the power of the occasional family heirloom. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide how pervasive magic is in a domain, choosing whether a dearth or an excess of magic is more terrifying.</p>
<h5 id=rarity-of-magic>
<a href=#rarity-of-magic class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Rarity of Magic</h5><p>In domains where inhabitants regard simple magic as remarkable, those inhabitants' lack of engagement with the supernatural doesn&rsquo;t mean you should limit magic for adventurers. Rather, use this as an opportunity to feature magic-using characters as figures of awe or terror, or to assign storied origins to common magic items.</p>
<h5 id=corrupted-magic>
<a href=#corrupted-magic class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Corrupted Magic</h5><p>The Dark Powers influence magical effects, imparting them with sinister qualities. How these changes manifest are for you to decide and can shift from domain to domain. Do summoned creatures appear undead in one domain or violently mutated in another? Do divination spells rasp in the voices of otherworldly ancients? Do the effects of drinking a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of healing</wc-fetch> feel like grubs weaving wounds shut from within? Magic looks menacing in the Domains of Dread, but descriptive embellishments shouldn&rsquo;t change the actual effects of spells or magic items.</p>
<h4 id=prison-of-souls>
<a href=#prison-of-souls class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Prison of Souls</h4><p>Everyone among the Domains of Dread is a prisoner. The Darklords number among the most prominent captives, but every creature claimed by the Mists dwells outside the natural order of the multiverse. Even death doesn&rsquo;t afford an escape from the Dark Powers, which hoard every soul that falls into their clutches. In the Land of the Mists, death isn&rsquo;t an escape, but the beginning of a new terror.</p>
<h5 id=soulless-shells>
<a href=#soulless-shells class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Soulless Shells</h5><p>Not every being among the Domains of Dread has a soul. Many inhabitants of each domain are creations of the Dark Powers, whose bodies have been formed from the land and the Mists. For all intents and purposes, and even under magical detection, these beings are what they appear to be. The Dark Powers fashion them as living puppetsâ€”individuals who live unremarkable lives that reinforce the status quo, culture, and frustration that torment a domain&rsquo;s Darklord.</p>
<h5 id=bright-souls>
<a href=#bright-souls class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Bright Souls</h5><p>Individuals born in the Land of the Mists who have souls tend to be vibrant, imaginative, and ambitious. But they find these virtues stifled by the dour, soulless individuals who outnumber them, leading many to seek better lives and answers to the mysteries of their home domain. Every player&rsquo;s character who was born in a domain is one of these vibrant souls.</p>
<h5 id=death-in-ravenloft>
<a href=#death-in-ravenloft class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Death in Ravenloft</h5><p>When a creature with a soul dies among the Domains of Dread, its spirit becomes caught in the Mists and can&rsquo;t travel to the afterlife. If a creature who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life by way of a spell or other supernatural means, it realizes that its spirit is trapped within the Mists, likely forever. Using the rules for &ldquo;Fear and Stress&rdquo; from chapter 4, the creature gains a new Seed of Fear.</p>
<p>If a being with a soul dies and is not returned to life, that soul remains trapped within the Domains of Dread until it is reincarnated, a process that can take decades. Individuals who inherit the same soul over generations often look alike and might recall memories of their past lives.</p>
<h5 id=metaphysical-mysteries>
<a href=#metaphysical-mysteries class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Metaphysical Mysteries</h5><p>The state of souls in the Domains of Dread provides a dose of existential terror to those hoping to manipulate life and death to escape these realms. Beyond that, who does and doesn&rsquo;t have a soul among the domains rarely matters unless an adventure explores themes of life, death, and reincarnation. Players might create ties with long-dead individuals using the Dark Gifts and backgrounds presented in chapter 1. But overall, spiritual stagnation in the Land of the Mists is meant to provide the opportunity for grim revelations, not existential bookkeeping.</p>

No spellâ€”not even <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch>â€”allows escape from the Domains of Dread. Spells such as <wc-fetch type=spell>astral projection</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>plane shift</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>teleport</wc-fetch>, and similar magic cast for the purpose of escaping a domain simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane. These restrictions apply to all other effects, including magic items and artifacts that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the <wc-fetch type=spell>etherealness</wc-fetch> spell and the Etherealness feature of ghosts, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from a domain is pulled back into the domain it left upon leaving the Ethereal.</p>
<p>For the purpose of spells whose effects change across or are blocked by planar boundaries (such as <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch>), each domain is considered its own plane. Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space. Spells cast within an extradimensional space (such as that created by <wc-fetch type=spell>Mordenkainen&rsquo;s magnificent mansion</wc-fetch> are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast within a domain.</p>
<p>While in the Domains of Dread, characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally, with one proviso: the domain&rsquo;s Darklord senses when someone in their domain casts such a spell and can choose to make themself the spell&rsquo;s target, so that they become the one who is contacted.</p>

With no basis for comparison, domain inhabitants call those who speak of other worlds liars. For them, the following topics are standard aspects of life in their home domain or in a broader collection of domains they call the Land of the Mists.</p>

As such, a domain might exhibit traditions and technologies unheard of in other domains. The specifics of each domain&rsquo;s technological advancements are left to you. If you wish domains to feature cutting-edge weird science or inventions such as firearms (see the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide), feel free to do so. Regardless of a domain&rsquo;s culture and innovations, the Mists prevent knowledge of them from spreading. Even if an innovation is taken from one domain to another, the suspicion of the new domain&rsquo;s inhabitants prevents it from gaining acceptance. Such is the subtle control of the Dark Powers, ensuring their nightmare realms remain just so.</p>

Though these currencies bear different markings, merchants aren&rsquo;t particular about the designs stamped on coinage. A gold piece from Barovia spends as well in Borca as it does in Har&rsquo;Akir, as long as it weighs true. Platinum and electrum coins rarely circulate through the domains, but they appear often enoughâ€”originating from hidden troves or ancient vaultsâ€”that no trader questions their value.</p>
<h4 id=languages>

Beyond this, all the other languages noted in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook and Monster Manual are spoken among the Domains of Dread, some more pervasively than others. The same language spoken in multiple domains might bear subtle differences or unique words. Speakers from different domains might also have distinct accents, but their words are understandable.</p>
<h5 id=dm-option-domain-languages>

For example, the language of Barovia could be Barovian or Balok. The languages of specific races, such as Elvish or Dwarvish, remain the same in every domain. Those who wish to learn a domain&rsquo;s language can do so using the training downtime activity (see the Player&rsquo;s Handbook). Although it takes 250 days to gain mastery of a language, consider allowing characters to navigate basic social interactionsâ€”such as asking for directions or conveying peaceful intentionsâ€”after 7 days of training.</p>
<h4 id=religion>

Conversely, some people privately worship ancestral godsâ€”deities of their family&rsquo;s tradition with whom they form deep, personal connections. Divergent faiths abound, and some that begin as charlatanry inexplicably gain the power of true faith. Ultimately, any deity from the Player&rsquo;s Handbook or any other setting might find followers among the Domains of Dread. By the same token, the Dark Powers breathe life into the beliefs of cruel practices and the faiths of false zealots.</p>
<p>One noteworthy exception to this is the worship of the god Ezra, which has its origins in the Mists (see the &ldquo;Ezra, God of the Mists&rdquo; sidebar). For your adventures, you define what deities are worshiped in a domain and whether those deities are actual gods, manifestations of the Dark Powers, or one masquerading as the other.</p>

Depicted as a vague, vaporous figure, the god is known for her dark, billowing hair and for her ability to manipulate the Mists. Her holy symbol is a sprig of belladonna atop a silver kite shield. Beyond that, her disparate sects of worshipers view her differentlyâ€”and contradictorily. For some, Ezra is a goodly guardian, while others perceive her as a soul-stealing embodiment of the Mists. Ultimately, though, her true nature is a mystery. Whether she&rsquo;s a manifestation of the Dark Powers, an aspect of the Plane of Shadow&rsquo;s mysterious Raven Queen, or something else entirely is for you to decide. Whatever the case, Ezra&rsquo;s followers, traditions, alignment, and the domains she grants her clerics vary widely. Collaborate with players who want to create characters devoted to Ezra to define the god&rsquo;s role in their domain of origin.</p>

However, in most domains, locals measure time by &ldquo;moons&rdquo; rather than months. As a measurement of time, each moon begins on the first night of a full moon and lasts a full lunar cycle. A year consists of twelve moons, or twelve lunar cycles. While domains don&rsquo;t ascribe to a shared history, the populace of all domains inexplicably accept the current year as 735. Some local histories cleave to anomalous dates and methods of tracking years, but these are considered obsolete. No such irregularities exist in Barovia, though, where year 1 corresponds with the founding of Barovia by the von Zarovich family.</p>

The Darklords' obsessions distract them from concerns about the nature of their domains or what lies beyond the Mists. This preoccupation, along with the lack of shared borders or reliable travel, means that mercantile ventures and military conquests between domains are essentially impossible.</p>
<p>Rare individuals do travel between the domains, such as adventurers or roving Vistani families (detailed at the end of this chapter). Others who wish to travel from one domain to another might wander into the Mists hoping to be carried elsewhere, or they can employ Mist talismans to guide them.</p>
<p>Due to the danger and unreliability of traveling the Mists, those few with interests beyond their home domains make letter writing their preferred method of communication. A group called the Keepers of the Feather (detailed in the &ldquo;Travelers in the Mists&rdquo; section later in this chapter) oversees a private network of carrier ravens that possesses the uncanny ability to navigate the Mists. These ravens deliver envelopes and tiny parcels between private rookeries maintained by the Keepers. Individuals and businesses friendly with the Keepersâ€”such as a village notary or innâ€”might surreptitiously contract their services, allowing customers to send a letter for 1 gp. These letters must include a destination where another Keeper can receive them, then either hold or deliver the correspondenceâ€”with delivery costs an additional 1 gp. Letters take at least one day to deliver. The Keepers of the Feather make no assurances about the safe delivery of letters in their charge, but their services prove relatively reliable. Rumors speak of more expensive services the Keepers provide to select clients, such as delivery to individuals whose whereabouts are unknown or verbal messages relayed by talking ravens.</p>

Though you might be tempted to make a Darklord an overwhelming threat, doing so risks distancing a rich, versatile villain from the characters. A Darklord is often far from the most physically daunting creature in their domain, but their nature as a Darklord makes permanently defeating them challenging. To defeat a Darklord, the characters should focus on undermining the Darklord&rsquo;s plots and striking at the core of the Darklord&rsquo;s torments to make them vulnerable (topics explored in &ldquo;The Domain&rsquo;s Downfall&rdquo; in chapter 2). A climatic encounter with a Darklord should happen when and how it&rsquo;s right for your adventures. After all, dread isn&rsquo;t a factor of challenge rating or character level, but of the suspense your adventures create.</p>

These sidebars describe the people of a particular domain, the horrors they routinely face, and their naming conventions.

The naming conventions they reference note the names of peoples featured in the &ldquo;Character Names&rdquo; section of Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything, they do not describe a domain&rsquo;s broader culture. Use the questions included in each sidebar to inspire players with ideas for their characters. Players don&rsquo;t need to answer every question or concern themselves with accurately representing a domain.

<p>In Barovia, the night is a curse. With the dying of the light, wicked souls slip from the darkened spires of Castle Ravenloft to work the will of an immortal overlord. This is the realm of the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, whose depravities have doomed him and countless generations to endlessly repeating cycles of obsession and despair.</p>
<p>The howls of wolves and shrieks of raven swarms echo through the dismal valleys and oppressive forests of Barovia. In isolated communities, superstitious villagers find the brightness in their lives smothered by dread of their aloof overlord, his baleful servants, and ancient evils that fester unopposed. All the domain&rsquo;s residents know to fear the Mists and the long Barovian nights, as through them the Devil Strahd watches and reaches to claim whatever he desires. Yet none realize their torments have played out over and over again, all part of Strahd&rsquo;s plot to claim one victim who has eluded him for generations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Barovia is a gloomy realm of valleys isolated by wolf-prowled forests and treacherous mountains. Dense clouds cast the land in perpetual gloom.</li>
<li>The land&rsquo;s somber, superstitious people live in small, scattered villages. These communities are each led by a burgomaster who seeks to avoid the ire of the land&rsquo;s aloof lord, Count Strahd von Zarovich. Strangers are widely viewed with suspicion.</li>
<li>Many locals believe Count von Zarovich is a vampire. He dwells in Castle Ravenloft, a citadel from which few return.</li>
<li>Vistani bands passing through Barovia are under the protection of the count. This protection stems from a past kindness the Vistani showed the count and from his long association with the fortune-teller Madam Eva. (See &ldquo;Travelers in the Mists&rdquo; at the end of this chapter for details on the Vistani.)</li>
<li>The stories of Barovia&rsquo;s people are full of hidden evils: treacherous witches, secretive cults, portentous ravens, vicious werewolves, and worse.</li>

The people favor dressing in muted but functional clothes, have a wide range of skin and hair colors, and often have names inspired by Slavic peoples. When players create characters from Barovia, ask them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>What was your life like in Barovia?</strong> Were you the child of a shepherd, vintner, or burgomaster? Was your life humble, or were you spared scarcity of coin and food? Did someone in your life vanish, or did you suffer some brush with the creatures of the night?</p>
<p><strong>What superstitions do you cleave to?</strong> Is there something you do or say every morning or at night? Do animalsâ€”particularly bats, ravens, or wolvesâ€”feature in your superstitions? What superstitions do you have regarding coins, doorways, meals, or wounds?</p>
<p><strong>Do you have recurring dreams or visions of unfamiliar experiences or past lives?</strong> Who were you in these dreams? What do they tell you about Barovia? Do you believe they hold any truth? Does Count Strahd von Zarovich feature in any of these visions?</p>

Here Strahd committed his bloodiest crimes and began the cycle of despair in which all Barovia remains locked. Lurking Undead, tormented spirits, and Strahd&rsquo;s other servants haunt the vast castle, each serving the count&rsquo;s schemes; reflecting some aspect of his depraved past; or protecting his coffin, which lies hidden within the castle&rsquo;s vast catacombs. Mementos of lost times and fallen heroes lie scattered throughout the count&rsquo;s home. Strahd keeps these relics close, but that might hold the key to his undoing.

Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov scours the land for wine and other small luxuries, hoping to infuse some happiness into the villagers' lives. Krezk&rsquo;s most prominent landmark, the Abbey of Saint Markovia, looms high on a nearby cliff. This abbey is the home of a group of strange, afflicted creatures who work for a young and striking abbot.

The burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich, is convinced happiness holds the key to Vallaki&rsquo;s salvation, and so he convenes festival after bizarre festival with titles such as the Festival of the Blazing Sun, the Promenade of Coffins, and the Wolf&rsquo;s Head Jamboree. Additionally, numerous factions are active within the town, including the Keepers of the Feather and the priests of Osybus (see &ldquo;Travelers in the Mists&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Groups,&rdquo; respectively, later in this chapter).</p>

The villagers rarely venture from their homes, suspecting their neighbors of wickedness and fearing evils are taking root in the shadows. Their fears are largely justified, as ghosts and vampire spawn haunt the town, and many locals have been consumed by their own callousness or wicked temptations. A rare exception to the village&rsquo;s cold desperation can be found at the local tavern called the Blood of the Vine. Those few who would oppose Strahd&rsquo;s evil congregate hereâ€”and are in turn spied upon by the count&rsquo;s agents.</p>

It was here that Strahd made his pact with the Dark Powers to become a vampire, with the blessing of the lich Exethanter. While the lich remains, albeit as a mere shadow of its former self, the true evil within the Amber Temple lies within its collection of amber sarcophagi. These monoliths hold vestiges of dead, hateful godsâ€”beings that aspire to re-create past depravities and manipulate mortals to fulfill unspeakable agendas. Various evil forces set their intentions upon the Amber Temple, viewing it as a nexus of secrets underpinning the nature of the Domains of Dread. The priests of Osybus (detailed in the &ldquo;Other Groups&rdquo; section later in this chapter) have particular interest in this site.</p>

</span></p>
<p>In life, Count Strahd von Zarovich was a ruthlessly effective conqueror. Over decades of brutal military campaigning, he defeated his rivals and forged a nation. Retiring from war, Strahd settled in the beautiful valley where he&rsquo;d won his greatest victory. There, in the way of his ancestors, he spilled his blood into the earth, sealing a pact between himself and the land. In honor of his parents, King Barov and Queen Ravenovia, he named the valley Barovia and constructed his fortress-home, Castle Ravenloft.</p>
<p>Strahd had spent his youth at war fighting alongside Ulmed, the founder of the Ulmist Inquisition, but as he reached his middle years he sought the comforts of family. He invited his kin to live with him at Castle Ravenloft, and was eventually joined by his younger brother, Sergei.</p>
<p>Sergei was everything Strahd wasn&rsquo;tâ€”youthful, empathic, and warm. Soon after he arrived in Barovia, the younger von Zarovich and a local villager named Tatyana fell in love. Strahd resented his brother, even more so after meeting Tatyana and experiencing her pure kindness. Obsessing over her, Strahd sought to woo Tatyana but was soundly rebuffed. Unwilling to accept her wishes or Sergei as his better, Strahd delved into the sinister secrets of his land and came to learn of the Amber Temple. There, amid hidden lore and the imprisoned vestiges of ancient evil, Strahd first encountered the Dark Powersâ€”and made a bargain with them to regain his vitality and ensnare Tatyana&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>The day of Sergei and Tatyana&rsquo;s wedding, Strahd murdered Sergei and, to seal his pact with the Dark Powers, drank his brother&rsquo;s blood. He revealed his new might to Tatyana, expecting to enthrall her. Instead, horrified by Sergei&rsquo;s murder, Tatyana fled Strahd, ultimately leaping from the height of Castle Ravenloft to escape him and vanishing into the Mists. At the same time, traitors from among the castle&rsquo;s guards and wedding&rsquo;s guests rose up to assassinate Strahd. Despite suffering countless wounds, Strahd did not die. The nature of his bargain with the Dark Powers was revealed, and Strahd became the multiverse&rsquo;s first vampire. A night of bloody rage followed, and when dawn touched the parapets of Castle Ravenloft, no living soul survived within. But Strahd remained.</p>
<p>Little is known of the origins of the Domains of Dread, but what&rsquo;s certain is that they began here. Strahd&rsquo;s villainy, his connection to his land, and his entanglement with the sinister Priest of Osybus (detailed in chapter 5) drew all of Barovia into the Shadowfell. This began a succession of torments that haunt the Count still and spill forth to drag others into the Land of the Mists.</p>

His statistics are similar to those of a vampire and his spellcasting prowess is formidable, enabling him to face most threats directly. Strahd ever seeks to escape his boredom and draws challenges out for as long as it entertains him. However, if insulted, the Darklord can turn all of Barovia against his foes.</p>

As part of this relationship, Strahd knows when any creature enters or dies violently within Baroviaâ€”and takes personal offense when his agents or the domain&rsquo;s wolves are slain. Strahd can also manifest a variety of dramatic effects, such as causing his voice to be heard on the wind, making his visage appear in the clouds, changing the weather, and so forth. He can&rsquo;t use these effects to aid him in combat, but they can make his presence known throughout the land.</p>

Strahd believes he has no peers and eagerly cultivates servants, particularly vampire spawn.

<li>Strahd chafes within the borders of his domain. His desire for novelty, passion, and conquest matches his thirst for blood.</li>

The domain&rsquo;s innumerable evils all ultimately tie back to Strahd. Any corrupt individual, sinister cult, or rampaging monster might have been inspired by the Darklord, their evil ultimately furthering the count&rsquo;s plots and infamy.</p>
<p>Strahd&rsquo;s depravity takes physical form in the vampire&rsquo;s lair, Castle Ravenloft. The castle is itself a notorious legend intrinsic to the count&rsquo;s terror. The Mists often deposit strangers to Barovia within sight of the fortress, daring the unwary to approach. Ultimately, only the bravest lay siege to the castle or accept the count&rsquo;s invitations to visit him there. But Castle Ravenloft needn&rsquo;t be challenged in a single assault, and defeating Strahd might not be the only goal of those who enter. The library, chapel, and catacombs of Castle Ravenloft all hold tempting secrets that might be vital to countering the count&rsquo;s plots or undoing other evils. Or Strahd might make good on an invitation to grant guests shelter and safety within the Castle Ravenloftâ€”for a time. Ultimately, don&rsquo;t hesitate to employ the setting&rsquo;s most infamous castle even if you don&rsquo;t plan to run a lengthy siege.</p>
<p>The adventure Curse of Strahd explores Barovia and Castle Ravenloft in detail, but you can also use the ideas on the Barovia Adventures table to create your own plots.</p>

No matter what form she takes, Strahd unceasingly seeks her, determined to possess her and soothe his rejected ego. The following section explores creating stories with Tatyana&rsquo;s latest incarnation at their center. This incarnationâ€”whether an unwitting innocent, a determined vampire, a villain, or something else entirelyâ€”influences both Strahd&rsquo;s and the characters' relationship with her. Consider how changing Tatyana&rsquo;s incarnation allows you to give your own distinct spin to Ravenloft&rsquo;s classic tale.</p>

<p>Protean apocalypses scar the impossible vistas of Bluetspur, and none who witness them remember. This alien domain etches itself not upon the waking mind, but rather upon the body as inexplicable scars and on the psyche through nightmares.</p>
<p>Not all the Domains of Dread are drawn from worlds hospitable to life. Bluetspur&rsquo;s scale and impossible geometry induce instinctual anxiety. Gaseous tempests whirl upon the hooked peaks of gravity-defying mountains, oily spires twist in semi-organic contortions, caustic fumaroles yawn and snap shut hungrily, and above it all hangs a dying red orb. Little can survive this wasteland, which is why Bluetspur&rsquo;s masters dwell underground.</p>
<p>Beneath the alien surface, the mind flayers of Bluetspur drift through the howling darkness of their ancient metropolis-laboratory. Within this sprawling installation, the illithids' numbers are few and their tentacles twitch with undisguised urgency. They toil to prevent the unthinkable: their primordial leader, the God-Brain of Bluetspur, is dying. Through these end times, the mind flayers work desperately to reconcile their god&rsquo;s demented whims even as they struggle to delay its demise. To those ends, their tentacles slip through the Mists to drag unwitting souls back to Bluetspur for all manner of experiments. Many abductees are returned with only psychic scars, while others are never seen again. An unlucky few find themselves set upon strange routes leading back to the alien realm, arriving only to realize they&rsquo;ve visited Bluetspur before.</p>

These visions share the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The land&rsquo;s surface is a lethal, alien place, scattered with the ruins of long-extinct civilizations.</li>
<li>A mountainâ€”massive beyond all wordsâ€”looms as a constant presence and thrums with a soundless pulse that nonetheless demands attention. Misshapen shadows crawl among its fissures.</li>
<li>Those who dream of events in this land often bear inexplicable scars, marks lending impossible evidence to their visions.</li>

Due to the endless assault of supernatural weather and earthquakes, civilizationâ€”as defined by the illithidsâ€”exists entirely below the ground. The Mists encroach even here, filling shadowed chasms and abandoned corridors. While the mind flayers have their own ways of describing the realm&rsquo;s features, the half-lucid ramblings of those who dream of the domain stretch to name and relate several prominent sites.</p>

Its contorted slopes stretch into the toxic heavens, and its form occupies the periphery of viewers' attention no matter which direction they look.</p>
<p>Mount Makab is not a natural feature, but rather part of a colossal, illithid-designed device. Its purposes remain largely mysterious to outsiders, but one thing is certain: it amplifies psionic energy, allowing Bluetspur&rsquo;s mind flayers to project their thoughts into other Domains of Dread.</p>
<h4 id=citadel-subterrene>

This mind flayer metropolis comprises innumerable interconnected compoundsâ€”laboratory vaults, custom prison-habitats, intellect devourer preserves, incubation domes, brain-filled synapse libraries, testing hippodromes, surgical theaters, and facilities that beggar rational description. Non-illithids find travel within the citadel maddening, like trying to find a specific point within a writhing knot of worms. Locations are inaccessible to creatures reliant upon basic terrestrial mobility or without the ability to access psionically controlled mechanisms. Entering Citadel Subterrene is simple, though, as fissures across Bluetspur, particularly upon Mount Makab, lead within.</p>

The cathedral-like chamber is roughly ovoid in shape, with walls of gleaming, organic metal. The massive God-Brain trembles in a pool of medicinal brine and experimental chemicals capable of dissolving most other creatures. The massive, alien brain&rsquo;s affliction is clear from the leaking holes pocking its deep-wrinkled lobes. Illithid attendants in eerie protective garb endlessly attend to their dying overlord and indulge even its most blasphemous schemes, such as the creation of Vampiric Mind Flayer (see chapter 5).</p>

As one might amputate an infected limb, the God-Brain cut off Mount Grysl from its psychic network. The abandoned residents largely succumbed to infighting and each other&rsquo;s amoral experiments. The spirits of these tormented mind flayers remain within Mount Grysl, as does the rebellion&rsquo;s leader: a bloated deviant that calls itself the High Master and seeks to undermine the God-Brain.</p>

Through ages of empire and conflict, the illithid elder brains indulged experiments without comparison or reference for lesser beings, explorations beyond the boundaries of time, reality, immortality, and the multiverse. Many failedâ€”at least one catastrophically so.</p>
<p>To summarize an eon of atrocities, one elder brain&rsquo;s reality-bending research had an unexpected result, revealing to it a malignant truth for which existence was unprepared. Guided by this burgeoning revelation, the elder brain turned and preyed upon its peers, consuming their discoveries and their physical forms to fuel an impossible apotheosis. Ultimately, though, the weight of the elder brain&rsquo;s deeds caused its own physicality to rebel, giving rise to an alien disease that began devouring its fleshy form. Horrified by an affliction that infected only them, the other elder brains united and psionically expelled the diseased brain from existence.</p>
<p>Or so they thought.</p>
<p>From a place without time or reality, the Dark Powers plucked the dying elder brain and planted it upon a tormented world. Ever since, the God-Brain of Bluetspur has dreamed and desperately indulged ever more demented schemes as it seeks to save its own life and give action to a thought alien even to it.</p>

Among the most bizarre of these schemes is the God-Brain&rsquo;s own: the creation of degenerate servants that hunt for balms for its affliction. These Vampiric Mind Flayer (see chapter 5) slip from Bluetspur to prey upon Humanoids. They then return to the God-Brain, bloated with cerebrospinal fluid to momentarily dull its suffering.</p>

Rather than barring creatures' escape, these Mists repress memories. Any non-Aberration who leaves Bluetspur is transported to a familiar place where they soon wake up, even if they weren&rsquo;t previously asleep. Their time in Bluetspur is repressed, altered as if by the <wc-fetch type=spell>modify memory</wc-fetch> spell. See &ldquo;Recovering Memories&rdquo; below for more details.</p>

Taking inspiration from sci-fi horror and tales of alien abduction, adventures involving Bluetspur&rsquo;s mind flayers might begin anywhere with bad dreams or a stranger&rsquo;s impossible rantings. Over time, disappearances, inexplicable scars, subdermal implants, and unlocked memories might reveal the mind flayers' tentacles enwrap more than anyone thought possible. See &ldquo;Return to Bluetspur&rdquo; for details on running adventures featuring lost memories, or consider developing other plots using the Bluetspur Adventures table.</p>

A session or series of sessions with a committed alienist might allow a character to remember a forgotten event.

As the characters encounter evidence of Bluetspur&rsquo;s mind flayers, consider giving individuals access to information they shouldn&rsquo;t logically possess or granting them advantage on rolls related to their hidden memories, doled out as you deem appropriate. This might take the form of allowing the character to navigate an alien installation, operate an inscrutable device, or read an otherworldly language. Don&rsquo;t explain why the character gains these benefits, though, and let them make their own explanations to other characters.

Players might run lower-level versions of their characters or use the survivors from Survivors to represent their past selves. Or characters might play forgotten versions of themselvesâ€”perhaps very different from who they are nowâ€”or individuals in the memories of another character. Run this adventure as an experience detached from your campaign&rsquo;s timeline, a flashback that relates the terrors of being a victim of the mind flayers' plots. Death likely doesn&rsquo;t mean much in these adventures, as characters somehow survived to remember their traumasâ€”perhaps through miraculous mind flayer surgeries. However, developments in the past can provide all manner of revelations, potentially unveiling terrifying truths hidden within characters' own minds and bodies.</p>

<p>Borca&rsquo;s nobles entangle the domain in a web of intrigues. While the common folk scrape for survival, the domain&rsquo;s callous aristocrats distract themselves with cruel diversions. They pay what they consider pittances in gold, land, and lives in pursuit of power, thrills, and the rarest pleasure: untarnished emotion. The common folk are merely tools to be exploited and discarded. Silver-tongued schemers use dreams and ambition to tempt innocents into debt, blackmail, and ruin, while furthering their rivalries or searching for decadent thrills. Guile and apathy are virtues in Borca, and none embody them more than the domain&rsquo;s two Darklords: the genius poisoner Ivana Boritsi and the childishly cruel stalker Ivan Dilisnya.</p>
<p>Outside the bejeweled playgrounds of the land&rsquo;s elite, Borca&rsquo;s common folk struggle against crime, poverty, and starvation. In scattered villages and tenement-filled cities, locals view nobles as celebrities, and their idealized vision of noble life leads them to mimic the aristocrats' callousness and appetite for empty fads. These starry-eyed innocents provide ready pawns for corruption. And those who don&rsquo;t bend to the whims of Borca&rsquo;s rulers face humiliation before they&rsquo;re inevitably crushed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Powerful families control the government, commerce, and entertainment in Borca. The Boritsi family holds the greatest influence.</li>
<li>Borcan noble families include a dominant main family and lesser branch lineages. Branch noble families (sometimes with different surnames) are subservient to the main family.</li>
<li>Each noble family maintains an estate with village-sized holdings nearby. These estates are testaments to the family&rsquo;s prestige, fortune, and hidden secrets.</li>
<li>The common folk live in rural villages that serve noble interests or in crowded cities. Most either avoid entanglements with powerful but fickle nobles or desperately court their favor.</li>
<li>Culture and prestige in Borca reach their height in the fabulous city of Levkarest. At its heart rises the Great Cathedral of the god Ezra.</li>

In either case, much of the populace possesses dark hair and varied skin tones with cool undertones. Names often take inspiration from German, Slavic, and more fantastical conventions. When players create characters from Borca, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>Do you come from a noble family?</strong> If so, are you in contact with any of its other members? Whom do you love or serve in your family? If you don&rsquo;t, why do people mistake you for nobility?</p>
<p><strong>How have you enriched a noble family?</strong> Have you invested in a noble&rsquo;s business? Does a percentage of your pay go toward an inescapable debt? Does an arranged marriage loom in your future?</p>
<p><strong>Whom have you hurt?</strong> In your family&rsquo;s struggles, your attempts to get ahead, or your desire to impress an acquaintance, you&rsquo;ve done someone a significant wrong. What was it? Why did you do it? Do you regret it?</p>

Nobles keep country homes among the nation&rsquo;s forests or rolling hills, well apart from the common rabble. Mobility between country and town is a luxury of the wealthy, making horses and coaches symbols of prestige.</p>

Unpopular members of the noble families squabble in the halls of the People&rsquo;s Parliament, the land&rsquo;s ineffective seat of government. The true rulers of the nation conduct business in the offices of faceless mercantile ventures and the back rooms of avant-garde clubs. The commoners of Levkarest glimpse this world of toxic glamor only from afar, or when nobles exploit street-level fads.</p>
<p>Beyond the nobles' elaborate rivalries, another force moves in Levkarest. At the Great Cathedral, pious commoners and aristocrats alike beg for the favor of the deity Ezra, but in the catacombs beneath the cathedral, a hidden cell of the Ulmist Inquisition meets. This society cultivates psionic prowess to undermine the evil in people&rsquo;s souls before it comes to fruition. Yet despite its ties to heroes and vast lore, the society finds its numbers dwindling. (See &ldquo;Other Groups&rdquo; later in this chapter for details.)</p>

Rather than rebuilding, the seven hundred survivors moved their homes a few miles east and founded New Ilvin. This sleepy community seems ordinary in every way, but residents avoid speaking of Old Ilvin and never return, going so far as to pave a new road to avoid the burned-out ruins.</p>

To counter the half-hearted justice doled out by local nobles, the city council of Sturben reinstituted a severe court system from Borca&rsquo;s past, where anyone can bring and argue cases before five masked judges. The judges who hear cases at the Faceless Court change, but their masks remain the same: grimly ornate visages inspired by Borca&rsquo;s mysterious first inhabitants. The court sends iron-masked circuit judges into the surrounding lands to execute justice. For especially contentious cases, judges imprison all involved and drag them to Sturben to face trial.</p>

Following the custom of Borcan high society, each family is expected to host at least two formal balls, banquets, or other extravagances annually. These events provide the setting for intrigues, politics, business arrangements, seductions, embarrassments, and social warfare. (See the &ldquo;Nobles of Borca&rdquo; section for more on these families.)</p>
<p>Among the most decadent noble holdings is Misericordia, the Boritsi estate. Situated amid miles of fields, greenhouses, and alchemy labs used to create exceptional Boritsi-branded perfumes and tinctures, the manor features multiple widow&rsquo;s walks and more than three hundred rooms. An awe-inspiring array of unique plants grows within the estate&rsquo;s private conservatory wings. The distillates from these plants furnish the lady of the house, Ivana Boritsi, with a room-sized perfume organâ€”along with a hidden, parallel collection of remarkable poisons.</p>

As they both committed depraved crimes in the same land at the same time, the Dark Powers gathered them both into the Domains of Dread. Generally, though, Ivana and Ivan have little to do with one another. Their homes occupy opposite ends of the domain, and their interests rarely overlapâ€”that is, until suitably intriguing characters arrive.</p>
<p>Ivana and Ivan are opposite sides of the same tarnished coin. Ivana fought for all she has and now loathes it; Ivan was given everything and believes he was denied what he deserves. Ivana is forced into society; Ivan thirsts for attention. Ivana appears perpetually youthful; Ivan bears the weight of ages.</p>
<p>Although your adventures might focus on either Darklord, Borca presents the opportunity to explore multiple facets of arrogance, selfishness, and obsession. The characters might become the objects of both Darklords' interests. This could put them at the center of a rivalry between the two or provide them with the unique opportunity to leverage one Darklord&rsquo;s power against another. An adventure in Borca doesn&rsquo;t have to involve a conflict between its two Darklords, but if it does, consider putting the party at the center of it.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The firstborn of the fantastically wealthy Boritsi aristocrats, Ivana was clever, poised, andâ€”in her father Klaus&rsquo;s eyesâ€”utterly unfit to lead their family. Unwilling to accept her father&rsquo;s view, Ivana spent her youth eschewing the dalliances of her kin, instead learning every aspect of her family&rsquo;s business in perfumes and medicinal herbs. Her mother, Camille, encouraged her daughter and tried to ensure that Ivana would one day lead the family.</p>
<p>Ivana&rsquo;s focus on her goals faltered when she met Pieter, a skilled chemist in the family&rsquo;s service. From him, Ivana learned alchemy and the perfumer&rsquo;s art, and the two grew close. Camille recognized Ivana&rsquo;s budding romance and saw the lowborn Pieter as a threat to Ivana&rsquo;s prospects. Camille thus seduced the young man and arranged for Ivana to discover them, intent on convincing her daughter to forsake this and all future romances.</p>
<p>Ivana took a different lesson from the experience. Realizing the depths of her family&rsquo;s corruption, she poisoned her mother and her callous brothers, with the goal of forcing Klaus to name her his heir. Creating and employing a series of aromatic toxins, she watched her siblings and treacherous mother sicken and die. None suspected her involvement.</p>
<p>On Ivana&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday, the aged and ailing Klaus summoned her to his office to share a momentous decision. Having lost his sons, Klaus named Ivana&rsquo;s cousin, Ivan Dilisnya, his heir. He had already announced his decision to the estate staff and sent a messenger to inform the Dilisnyas.</p>
<p>Ivana only laughed as a toxic mist poured across the Boritsi estate. Having expected her father&rsquo;s pettiness, she had manufactured a disaster that turned all the estate&rsquo;s perfume into poison. Drinking the antidote, Ivana watched as Klaus and all the manor&rsquo;s workers and inhabitants died choking amid a violet fog. By the time the poison cleared, the land of Borca had become surrounded by the Mists.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ivana has not aged since the Mists claimed Borca, and her youthful appearance leads many to underestimate her.</li>
<li>Ivana rules her family&rsquo;s business and political empire brilliantly. Despite this, she is endlessly doubted and second guessed. Many believe she is a typical, vacant noble youth or the puppet of her elder cousin, Ivan Dilisnya.</li>
<li>Ivana&rsquo;s genius and refinement lead her to grow swiftly bored of most potential allies and rivals. She ever seeks her equal in intellect and ambition, and she is ever disappointed. Maintaining her family&rsquo;s vast array of social expectations is especially tedious.</li>
<li>Ivana never found her father&rsquo;s will and knows that should it fall into the wrong hands, her depraved cousin Ivan could claim all she&rsquo;s earned. She&rsquo;ll do anything to prevent this.</li>

The land of Borca originates from the same world as Barovia&rsquo;s conquerors, the von Zaroviches, and Dilisnyas were present at Castle Ravenloft the night of Strahd von Zarovich&rsquo;s transformation.</p>
<p>Ages later, the siblings Boris and Camille Dilisnya each plotted to steal the prestige of their cousins, the Boritsis. Camille manipulated her way into the Boritsi family while Boris prepared his son Ivan to be the new head of a united Boritsiâ€“Dilisnya line. Despite abundant opportunities to excel, Ivan grew to embody childish vice and impulsiveness, with his family&rsquo;s wealth and doting servants exacerbating these whims. Frequent &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; transpired around Ivan, forcing his family to cover up the maimings and deaths of numerous pets and servants. Only Ivan&rsquo;s sister, Kristina, was exempt from his bullying and wicked tricks.</p>
<p>Over time, Kristina proved precocious and eager to learn. Ivan, however, became stubbornly obsessed with childish toys and behaviors. He encouraged his sister to indulge his idealized visions of their childhood, going so far as to affect childlike behaviors and ways of speaking. Although his family members grew increasingly unsettled, they sheltered the future head of their house, reshaping their estate and investing in whimsical diversions for him.</p>
<p>On the night Ivana Boritsi poisoned her family, Ivan learned of his parents' intention to send Kristina to a prestigious boarding school. Screams, cruel cackling, and clockwork screeching filled the Dilisnya estate that night. When it ended, Ivan was the last living member of the Dilisnya family, and the Mists closed in around Borca.</p>

The mansion lies at the heart of the estate, and is divided into multiple structures, including the Laughing House, a playhouse where life-sized toys enact brutal operas, and Ivan&rsquo;s Playroom, a wing dedicated to the master of the estate&rsquo;s clockwork tinkering and private decadences. Ivan tempts victims to his home, where they gradually realize they&rsquo;re trapped in a fun house of childish grotesqueries. Those unable to escape are eventually forced to don the ludicrous livery of the Dilisnya household staff and become Ivan&rsquo;s new servants.</p>

He closes them to prevent those he&rsquo;s obsessing over from escaping. When he closes Borca&rsquo;s borders, the Mists rise as detailed in &ldquo;The Mists&rdquo; section at the start of this chapter. Additionally, the fog is filled with Ivan&rsquo;s taunting voice and patrolled by grim clockwork toys.</p>

The following circumstances endlessly torment him:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ivan is alone, and the solitude terrifies him. He was given everything, destroyed it all, and doesn&rsquo;t know how to live. He endlessly creates fawning, fake family from clockwork creations to distract him from his solitude.</li>
<li>Ivan resents Ivana Boritsi, his closest relative, for having the power he was groomed for, but he also views her as his only peer and as a potential replacement for his sister. Ivana, however, avoids him at all costs.</li>
<li>Ivan looks like a fantastically unkempt old man, a state he believes he has no control over and that grows more pronounced daily. He thinks Ivana keeps the secret of her eternal youth from him.</li>

Adventures set in Borca often involve characters participating in the machinations of the domain&rsquo;s nobles, whether as involuntary pawns or as part of schemes to see them indebted to amoral patrons. The domain&rsquo;s two Darklords also provide opportunities to explore different types of amoral arrogance and petty obsessions. Characters might become caught between Ivana Boritsi and Ivan Dilisnya&rsquo;s unique obsessionsâ€”but could also learn that the best way to undermine these villains is to play them against one another.</p>
<p>The following sections detail the schemes of the domain&rsquo;s nobles and Darklords, while the Borca Adventures table suggests other adventures appropriate to the domain.</p>

The following families are Borca&rsquo;s most prominent, though dozens of lesser branch families orbit each:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Boritsi.</b> The Boritsi name is a mark of quality and innovation, appearing across Borca on perfumes, tonics, and dozens of buildings and theaters. Countless families claim ties to the Boritsis.</li>
<li><b>Dilisnya.</b> The family defensively guards its prestige, as its wealth is based in agricultureâ€”particularly rearing pigs. Treacherous branch families have warred among themselves since the loss of nearly the entire main family.</li>
<li><b>Eris.</b> The elderly Tolashara Eris claims to be the last of her line. She pours her family&rsquo;s wealth into supporting art in Levkarest and endlessly building her estate both taller and deeper.</li>
<li><b>Ivliskova.</b> The Ivliskovas run dozens of orphanages and the elite Ivliskova Finishing School. This boarding school boasts a flawless graduation rateâ€”for those students who don&rsquo;t disappear.</li>
<li><b>Nobriskov.</b> Pious and formal, the Nobriskovs claim descent from Borca&rsquo;s ancient clans and hide their family&rsquo;s lycanthropic curse.</li>
<li><b>Nuikin.</b> Every member of this competitive family is expected to become a genius in their respective field. Numerous libraries, museums, and theaters advertise Nuikin accomplishments.</li>
<li><b>Ocrotire.</b> The Ocrotires descend from respected admirals and seafaring explorers (despite Borca&rsquo;s lack of a coast). Their estate features a vast oceanarium featuring thousands of bizarre sea creatures and a complete megalodon skeleton.</li>
<li><b>Olzanik.</b> This family of metalworkers obsesses over war. To them, every success is a conquest, but no Olzanik has ever seen battle in national service.</li>
<li><b>Piechota.</b> The estate of Borca&rsquo;s best ranchers lies half ruined as the result of another family&rsquo;s treachery. Their wealth largely expended, the Piechotas open their home to travelers along the Ruby Road.</li>
<li><b>Pretorius.</b> The Pretorius estate is a raucous casino surrounded by the Ash Gardens, a region burned in a vast wildfire. Those who can&rsquo;t pay debts incurred at the casino are burned alive and their ashes scattered in the wastelands.</li>
<li><b>Ritter.</b> The shear-wielding Ritters define the cutting edge of fashion. Their coveted designs change seasonally, and any who create reproductions meet vicious ends.</li>
<li><b>Tatenna.</b> Bankers and landlords, the Tatennas track debts across the domain. They deal with every family except the Olzaniks, with whom they maintain a generations-old feud.</li>

Something as simple as having the right talent or piece of gear could cause a noble to take notice of a character and invite them to an outing or event that leads to further intrigues.

It&rsquo;s then up to the characters whether they obey or find a way to escape the noble&rsquo;s schemes. This might even be the point where the noble reveals that they&rsquo;ve been an agent of Ivana Boritsi or Ivan Dilisnya all along, and now the Darklord they serve has a use for the characters.</p>

She isn&rsquo;t a spellcaster, but her insights into alchemy allow her to create chemically potent mind-altering effects. Ivana&rsquo;s chemical arsenal includes drinks that convey illusory sensations, perfumes that charm creatures, and dramatic poisons activated by innocuous secondary triggers. Through suggestion and by subtly exposing targets to her chemicals, Ivana convinces victims she&rsquo;s practically omnipotent.</p>
<p>Use the poisons detailed in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide as a baseline for the effects Ivana creates and combine them with the effects of enchantment and illusion spells to design custom, nonmagical toxins for her. The <wc-fetch type=item>Ivana&rsquo;s Whisper</wc-fetch> combines an inhaled poison and the <wc-fetch type=spell>dream</wc-fetch> spell, creating a tool Ivana uses to manipulate her agents.</p>

Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s a selfish and controlling individual. To enable his need for attention, the Dark Powers granted him a subtle ability to have the letters he writes magically delivered. Ivan uses this simple power for amoral, cowardly ends. On rare occasions Ivan takes his clockwork coach through communities to watch for passersby worth writing to.</p>

If Ivan writes a letter and addresses it to a creature whose name he knows and whom he&rsquo;s seen before, he can choose to have one such letter vanish at midnight of the following night. That letter then reappears in an unobserved but obvious space near the letter&rsquo;s addressee during their next long rest. The letter might appear among the recipient&rsquo;s mundane mail, on their bedside table, or among their gear. A letter&rsquo;s mysterious means of delivery is never observed. Ivan&rsquo;s letters can reach a target anywhere within the Domains of Dread.</p>

He writes frequently, using the facade of the recipient&rsquo;s secret admirer, a youngster in need of help, or a distant family member, though his lies fracture over time. His salutations are off-putting or childishly insulting, like &ldquo;Dear Delicious Knuckle&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Preening Pig-Face.&rdquo; His letters' contents typically focus on him rather than the recipient, obsessing over his feelings, distractions, and self-indulgent rants. Inevitably, his cowardly cruelty shows through as the letters grow increasingly possessive and insulting. He initially coaxes recipients to fetch gifts for him or to undermine his foes, but his requests culminate in insisting that the recipient joins him at Degravo, the Dilisnya estate.</p>

<p>Resplendent with bright banners, calliope music, and the smells of rich food, the Carnival promises visitors a surreal wonderland where any dream is possible.</p>
<p>Garish fliers appear before the Carnival&rsquo;s arrival, promising marvels, terrors, and a brief escape from the gloom of daily life. But nothing in the Land of the Mists is beyond suspicion, and the wise know strangers are intrinsically dangerous.</p>
<p>The Carnival doesn&rsquo;t exist to entertain its visitors. Rather, it&rsquo;s a traveling domain, capable of visiting other domains and lands beyond the Mists. Visibly marked as outsiders by birth, circumstance, intention, or talent, the Carnival&rsquo;s troupers trade their unique performances for coin and whatever else they need to survive. Although these entertainers are well intentioned, sinister forces travel in their wake. The longer the Carnival tarries in one place, the greater the threat to the performers and visitors. So the Carnival travels constantly, lest the troupers endanger the lands they visit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fliers advertising the Carnival&rsquo;s impending arrival appear mysteriously in communities before it appears. The Carnival doesn&rsquo;t contribute to their production or distribution.</li>
<li>Two silver pieces buy a ticket to the Carnival, while the Big Top&rsquo;s shows, the Hall of Horrors, and sideshows have their own entry fees.</li>
<li>The Carnival wanders endlessly, never staying anywhere for more than a few weeks. Most settlements welcome this traveling diversion, but tragedies follow its path.</li>
<li>Merchants unaffiliated with the Carnival follow its travels and set up shop alongside it. Known as the Litwick Market, this collection of tents and booths is filled with strange vendors and stranger goods.</li>
<li>Those seeking an escape from a place or their current lives can join the Carnival. As long as travelers are willing to work and contribute to the community, they&rsquo;re welcome to stay as long as they like.</li>

<p><strong>Do you perform</strong>? Have you devised a way to profit from your circumstances? Are you proud of your performances? Do you have a show mentor or partner? Or do you earn your way in the Carnival as a laborer, as a vendor, or in another role?</p>

A handful of horses and exotic pack animals transport the Carnival&rsquo;s two dozen wagons from site to site.</p>
<p>One of the Carnival&rsquo;s oldest performers, Hermos the Half-Giant, handles the Carnival&rsquo;s day-to-day operations. Hermos is a mountain of muscle half again as tall as most human adults. His deliberate manner and coolheaded demeanor earn him the respect of the Carnival&rsquo;s troupers. Other senior or charismatic figures hold influence over cliquish groups of performers, but few dare openly contradict Hermos since he&rsquo;s favored by the Carnival&rsquo;s leader, Isolde.</p>
<p>The Carnival&rsquo;s arrangement varies depending on where it sets up, but always includes a thoroughfare of games, food, and sideshow stalls leading from the ticketing gate to the Big Top.</p>

For 2 copper pieces, visitors enter a tent and watch a performer&rsquo;s show. The Carnival&rsquo;s best-known attractions include the following troupers (along with the stat blocks they use):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tindal the Barker.</b> Tindal, the Carnival&rsquo;s cynical, fast-talking lead barker (mage), tours the grounds with visitors. At their last stop, he reveals his own uniqueness as the Amazing Soul-less Man: he casts no reflection and claims to lack a soul.</li>
<li><b>Alti the Werehare.</b> A quick-tongued rapper and dancer, Alti (wererat) is a bombastic performer who turns into a rabbit on nights of the full moon.</li>
<li><b>Amelia the Vampire.</b> Amelia (scout with a flying speed of 30 feet) is a cheery acrobat aided in her performances by a pair of leathery wings that allows her to fly. Before stepping on stage, she powders her face, affects a somber accent, and pretends to be undead.</li>
<li><b>Charlotte the Fire Eater.</b> This juggling daredevil (veteran) performs with a dizzying array of flaming knives and other deadly objects. She claims that her blood is flammable and that she&rsquo;s burned the hair off eighteen hecklers.</li>
<li><b>The Organ Grinder.</b> This somber clown grinds an ornate barrel organ (scout). An attendant group of mischievous, half-trained, not-quite-identifiable animals caper to this music. The clown never speaks but allows visitors to guess at the animals' nature for a copper piece.</li>
<li><b>Silessa the Snake.</b> A dancer and animal tamer, Silessa (druid) performs with a collection of rare serpents. She claims she was born a snake and magically transformed into an elf.</li>

This sizable, sinister tent contains a maze of taxidermic creatures, cabinets of curiosity, peculiar specimens in jars, and the occasional true wonder. Pacali hides a personal unsettling secret. During his time as a researcher at the Brautslava Institute in Darkon, Pacali was cursed: his worst impulses now grow from his body as terrible creatures. He bottles these murderous homunculi and touts them as &ldquo;Professor Pacali&rsquo;s Pickled Punks,&rdquo; but every now and then one &ldquo;escapes.&rdquo; Pacali persistently criticizes Hermos and Isolde, but rarely acts against them directly.</p>

Wherever it goes, fey creatures chase after it, appearing on the Carnival&rsquo;s outskirts as mysterious merchants selling dangerous enigmas and Mist talismans. They peddle lost memories or love potions for peculiar prices, such as the buyer&rsquo;s dreams or ability to speak vowels. Gradually, more dangerous fey arriveâ€”creatures who delight in sabotaging performances or nearby settlements. These tricks and accidents grow increasingly dangerous, potentially culminating in disasters for which the Carnival&rsquo;s troupers ultimately take the blame. All these fey hold a grudge against the Carnival. They light their stalls with eerie colored lanterns and call themselves the Litwick Market.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Isolde was a holy warrior devoted to a pantheon of elven deities called the Seldarine. In this role, she defended the Feywild against dragons, demons, and other threats. In time, her heroics caught the eye of an archfey named Zybilna, who had forged secret pacts with some of the fiends Isolde and her companions had slain. Rather than be angry at Isolde, Zybilna was impressed by her. She enlisted a powerful fiend known only as &ldquo;the Caller&rdquo; to corrupt and slay all of Isolde&rsquo;s companions, leaving Isolde alone, bitter, and vulnerable. The insidious archfey then befriended Isolde and offered to help her forget her terrible losses. Isolde became the master of a traveling fey carnival that served as a gateway to Zybilna&rsquo;s domain. The carnival did what Zybilna hoped it would do: it brought comfort to Isolde and quelled her thirst for vengeance.</p>
<p>Zybilna and Isolde enjoyed a strong partnership for years, but as time wore on, they grew distant until their relationship finally soured. Eladrin crave change, yet Isolde felt like she was frozen in time. She wished to leave the fey carnival and pursue other dreams, but Zybilna wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it and secretly used <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spells to make Isolde place her devotion to the carnival above her desire to leave it.</p>
<p>When Isolde&rsquo;s fey carnival crossed paths with another carnival from the Shadowfell, the eladrin found the escape she longed for. Isolde orchestrated a trade with the other carnival&rsquo;s owners, a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell). Isolde would become the master of their carnival, and they would become the masters of hers. To appease Zybilna, this arrangement would remain in place only until the two carnivals crossed paths again.</p>
<p>Zybilna was intrigued enough by the shadar-kai to let Isolde go, but not without casting a spell that made Isolde forget about Zybilna and her Feywild domain, thus preventing the eladrin from divulging the archfey&rsquo;s secrets. As a further punishment, Zybilna sent malevolent fey creatures to hound Isolde and her Shadowfell carnival. Isolde doesn&rsquo;t know who is behind this petty torment, nor does she care. Her hunt for the Caller and her thirst for vengeance have become all-consuming.</p>

In its lifetime, the sword has beheaded thousands of criminals, not all of whom were guilty of the crimes for which they were convicted. The sword cannot distinguish the guilty from the innocent. With each beheading, it hungers for more justice and blood.</p>
<p>Nepenthe came to the Carnival in the hands of a retired half-ogre who moonlighted as a sword-swallower. When the half-ogre died of old age, the sword was deemed the property of the Carnival. It was given to Isolde by the Carnival&rsquo;s previous owners, who claimed that the sword would help her protect the Carnival against any threat.</p>
<p>In Isolde, the sword found a partner who shared its blind malice toward the guilty. Isolde uses Nepenthe to behead anyone found guilty of stealing from the Carnival or inflicting harm upon it.</p>
<p>As soon as Isolde took up the blade, it rekindled the grief and fury she had suppressed for so long, awakening the desire to avenge her long-dead companions by slaying the fiend she knows as the Caller (see &ldquo;Mist Wanderers&rdquo; later in this chapter for details). Isolde always chooses the Carnival&rsquo;s stops based on her predictions of the Caller&rsquo;s next steps, and if her pursuit forces the Carnival into danger, so be it. Only by ridding Isolde of Nepenthe can she truly escape the Dark Powers' clutches. But Isolde will never part with the blade willingly, and if it is taken from the Carnival, the sword will always find its way back.</p>
<p>In addition to having the properties of a <wc-fetch type=item>holy avenger</wc-fetch>, Nepenthe is a sentient, neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet. It can read and understand Elvish. It can also speak Elvish, but only through the voice of its wielder, with whom the sword can communicate telepathically. When using its telepathy to speak to Isolde, the sword can mimic the voices of Isolde&rsquo;s fallen companions as it drives her to catch their fiendish killer. Unlike Isolde, whose motives are good, the sword is corrupt and irredeemable.</p>

The Carnival provides one of the few means of escaping from another Darklord&rsquo;s domain, since it ignores the closed borders of other domains.

<p>The following truths endlessly weigh upon her:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Carnival constantly grows, bringing additional souls dependent on Isolde&rsquo;s guardianship. She&rsquo;s tortured by her obligation toward the Carnival&rsquo;s troupers and her vow to avenge her murdered companions.</li>
<li>Isolde obsessively plots the perfect confrontation with her immortal quarry, the Caller. But the small concerns of the Carnival nag at her ceaselessly, exacerbated by the fey interlopers drawn to her presence. Her burdens drive her to seek seclusion to keep her legendary temper in check.</li>
<li>Isolde dreads the day when the Carnival crosses paths with its fey counterpart for a second time. Were that to happen, Isolde would be forced to relinquish the Carnival to its true shadar-kai masters, and Nepenthe along with it.</li>

<p>The domain of Darkon has failed. Across the land, ageless monuments and magical wonders crumble before the Shroudâ€”the Mists turned hungry.</p>
<p>Once the prison of the lich Azalin Rex, Darkon stretched between two oceans, its lands filled with gothic cities and the monuments of forgotten wizard-tyrants. Largely ignoring his role as ruler, Azalin dwelled in seclusion while manufacturing magical atrocities and manipulating prophecies to free himself from the Dark Powers' grip. He finally succeeded, orchestrating a magical event that shook the entire domain: the Hour of Ascension. The Darklord vanishedâ€”and Darkon changed.</p>
<p>Since Azalin&rsquo;s disappearance, a strange golden star called the King&rsquo;s Tear hangs in the heavens, and each night the Mists surrounding the domain roil with hidden activity and creep inward. These Mists, now known throughout the domain as the Shroud, erode Darkon&rsquo;s borders. Those fleeing the Shroud report strange shapes and figures within. What happens to the lands claimed by the Shroud is a mystery, and none who enter it return.</p>
<p>Despite facing gradual annihilation, Darkon&rsquo;s living population largely ignores the threat, dismissing reports of vanished regions as rumors and fearmongering. As the domain splits into crumbling islands, ambitious beings vie for Azalin&rsquo;s power, each claiming to be the lost king&rsquo;s obvious successor. These would-be tyrants blame one another for the domain&rsquo;s dissolution, and each believes they alone can save Darkon by becoming its sole ruler.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Mists consuming Darkon have divided the land into four regions: the Jagged Coast, Lychgate, the Mistlands, and Rexcrown.</li>
<li>Azalin Rex, King of Darkon, vanished during the Hour of Ascension. Since then, an unmoving golden star called the King&rsquo;s Tear hangs in the sky. The sun and moon pass behind this star daily.</li>
<li>The Kargat, the nation&rsquo;s secret police, is particularly active in Darkon&rsquo;s largest cities: Martira Bay and Il Aluk.</li>
<li>The night after any Humanoid dies, its corpse rises as a mindless Undead that shambles into the night. Locals swiftly burn bodies to prevent this.</li>

While diverse groups of humans dwell in the domain&rsquo;s cities, there are several communities where nonhumans are in the majority, including the dwarves and orcs of Tempe Falls, the elves of Neblus and Nevuchar Springs, the gnomes and halflings of Mayvin, and the dragonborn and drow of Vradlock. People of any sort might find a home somewhere in Darkon. When players create characters from Darkon, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>What part of Darkon are you from?</strong> Are you from the mysterious Jagged Coast, the decadent lands of Rexcrown, or the eerie Mistlands? Were you raised in a community where your people were in the majority?</p>
<p><strong>How has your life been affected by the Shroud?</strong> Was your home consumed by the Shroud? Have members of your family vanished? Or do you believe the Shroud is a delusion of superstitious locals?</p>
<p><strong>How does your community prevent the dead from rising?</strong> Is burning corpses a common practice or a taboo? How have you seen a burial rite go wrong?</p>

In truth, Avernus was a perilously haunted fortress, home to Azalin&rsquo;s deadliest servants and magical depravities. During the Hour of Ascension, that changed.</p>
<p>Castle Avernus was destroyed in a torrent of otherworldly flame, an explosion that froze partway through its blast. The castle now hangs in midair, its chambers, laboratories, and crypts suspended in disjointed sections. Magic woven into the fortress&rsquo;s stones attempts to heal the shattered castle, causing new halls and rambling stairs to form between fractured floors. These surreal ruins can&rsquo;t conceal the magical radiance hanging at the castle&rsquo;s coreâ€”a vestige of the magical force that destroyed the castle and precipitated the Hour of Ascension. This mysterious force now calls to spirits across Darkon, drawing them in to feed an ongoing magical reaction.</p>
<p>Despite the devastation, Castle Avernus isn&rsquo;t empty. Azalin&rsquo;s treasures and former servants survived, including Ebbasheyth, the Darklord&rsquo;s black shadow dragon advisor; a vast library that records the memories of all who die in Darkon; and the tomb haunted by Irik Zal&rsquo;honen, Azalin&rsquo;s son.</p>

Cut off from ports elsewhere in the domain, Il Aluk&rsquo;s nobles cling to lies of prosperity while their fortunes dwindle. They have passed their suffering on to their servants, forcing the populace into poverty and inciting a swell of a violence ranging from riots to assassinations. The nobles' rising fear then swept Madame Eris into power; her elitist cruelties and faux reminiscences have precipitated a rash of brutal murders and fabulous balls.</p>

A center of trade, the city receives regular visits from eerie vessels from mysterious lands. The oddities these ships bring make Martirans indifferent to miraculous sights. This unflappability helps residents avoid standing out or drawing the attention of the Kargat, Darkon&rsquo;s secret police, who conduct their domain-spanning conspiracies from the city&rsquo;s notorious fortress, the Black Tower (see &ldquo;Other Groups&rdquo; later in this chapter for details).</p>
<p>An unprecedented number of serial killers prey on Martira Bay, most infamously the Midnight Slasher, the Spider, and the Weeping Woman. The overwhelmed constabulary has requested aid from spiritualist groups and professional detectives such as the Ray Agency and the Dusklight Detectives.</p>

Here the town&rsquo;s elf mystics, known as the Eternal Order, study alchemy and the rare properties of their famed amber hot springs. Secretive traditions veil their methods, but the miraculous effects of their practices are undeniable. Those in need of healing or relaxation visit lavish spas such as the famous Cascana Sanitarium. For all the springs' wonders, some who visit emerge psychologically changed. The locals shrug off these dangers, repeating the local aphorism and spa slogan: &ldquo;Never wait to wash away the old you.&rdquo;</p>

</span></p>
<p>It took Alcio years to learn of her brother&rsquo;s death at the hands of Rudolph van Richten, a doctor from Rivalis (see &ldquo;Mist Wanderers&rdquo; at the end of the chapter). Furious, she sought revenge, but van Richten had moved on, his trail hidden by the Mists. Alcio sought hints of the doctor&rsquo;s location at Richten House, his family&rsquo;s estate. There, she found the spirit of Rudolph&rsquo;s wife, Doctor Ingrid van Richten. Despite imaginative bargains and threats, Alcio couldn&rsquo;t convince Ingrid to reveal anything beyond psychological diagnoses and bemused mockery. Furious, the vampire sought other avenues in her search for her brother&rsquo;s slayer.</p>
<p>In Martira Bay, Alcio discovered Baron&rsquo;s allies in the Kargat. Through audacity and violence, she adopted her brother&rsquo;s rank and the fiction that he held a noble title. As Baron Metus, Alcio flourished in the criminal and espionage communities the Kargat dominated.</p>
<p>When Azalin vanished, Alcio turned her connections with living criminals against the Kargat&rsquo;s largely vampiric leaders. They quickly fell to her allied gangs-turned-vampire hunters, and the Kargat fractured, with Alcio taking over the Black Tower.</p>
<p>Now, Alcio spreads her agents across Darkon, targeting Il Aluk as the next addition to her territory. She still seeks information on Rudolph van Richten, either his whereabouts or a means to coerce Ingrid van Richten to betray what she knows.</p>

Throughout history, the waters had cryptically spoken to members of the Eternal Order. Now Cardinna interpreted their message as a personal mission to prevent the end of the world.</p>
<p>Having heard of the Shroud, Cardinna delved into the libraries of her order. There, she discovered writings alluding to &ldquo;the land,&rdquo; &ldquo;the ancient,&rdquo; and their reliance on one another. She surmised that Darkon needed not just a ruler but a heart. Though most thought of Azalin as Darkon&rsquo;s only ruler, there was once another: Darcalus Rex, its first king.</p>
<p>Through magic and chemical manipulation, Cardinna summoned the spirit of Darcalus Rex, the tyrannical wizard-king who ruled prior to Azalin. Cardinna&rsquo;s magic worked, causing a mysterious entity to inhabit her order&rsquo;s sacred pools.

Despite its ancient name, the family has long endured crushing debt. Through poise and predatory business dealings, members have clung to their rotted estate, Calasquel. As the fortunes of Il Aluk&rsquo;s elite withered, Talisveri Eris took advantage of her family&rsquo;s duplicitous expertise, peddling empty assurances from the center of a web of credit, gossip, and desperate debtors.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Bubbly and fantastically vain, Madame Eris would appear to be a woman of nearly eighty if her attempts at magical age-defiance hadn&rsquo;t resulted in her permanent invisibility. The result of imbibing a flawed magic elixir meant to make her look younger, Eris&rsquo;s invisibility has persisted for decades. She uses avant-garde fashion and gallons of makeup to create the face she presents publicly, as well as presenting numerous alter egos: fictitious family members such as her miserly cousin, Halpernista; her foppish nephew, Oscanor; and her bewilderingly ancient and perpetually furious sister, Lady Tatsaul.</p>
<p>Madame Eris hosts elaborate balls at Calasquel, outside Il Aluk, during which she privately meets with attendees, learns their woes, and tempts them into exploitative business ventures. She plays the nostalgic, elder aristocrat who themes her events around bygone decades, featuring period entertainments and fare that only she remembersâ€”since they&rsquo;re largely lies of her creation.</p>
<p>On the night of each new moon, Madame Eris hosts a private event, gathering her loyal and indebted associates. She refers to this group as the Family. As she deeply exploits these entitled young nobles, she leads them to believe they&rsquo;re key to restoring Il Aluk&rsquo;s grandeur. During this event, she encourages her guests to drink a cordial called the Spirit of Nobility. This magic elixir grants the drinker the effect of a <wc-fetch type=spell>greater invisibility</wc-fetch> spell until dawn. Madame Eris then encourages her guests to indulge their desire for violenceâ€”and commit crimes that further her plots. Residents of Il Aluk stay indoors during the new moon, believing hateful spirits walk the streets then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>####### Who Is Azalin Rex?</p>
<p>In life, Azalin was an arrogant wizard-tyrant who murdered his brother, executed his son, and embroiled his nation in unending war. The Mists claimed him and he emerged in Barovia. When the locals asked him who he was, he responded &ldquo;<em>azal&rsquo;Lan</em>,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;wizard-king&rdquo; in his native language.</p>
<p>In Barovia, Azalin formed a truce with Strahd von Zarovich. From the count and the land&rsquo;s ancient ruins, he learned much of the nature of the Domains of Dread. Azalin and Strahd attempted to escape Barovia multiple times, but failure and resentment eventually turned the villains into vicious rivals. When Azalin forsook Castle Ravenloft and reentered the Mists, his own domain, Darkon, took shape around him.</p>
<p>Few understood the nature of the Domains of Dread and the Dark Powers more astutely than Azalin. The lich considered the Dark Powers his personal rivals and spent centuries concocting audacious plots to escape Ravenloft. With the Hour of Ascension, he may have succeeded.</p>

<p>Ultimately, whatever course you choose, the characters in horror stories rarely escape unscarred. Perhaps a character or one of their allies must make a dramatic sacrifice to save Darkonâ€”or become the new Azalin. Or perhaps Darkon is irrevocably, doomed and the characters must choose which piece of the fractured domain will survive. In any case, whether a new Darklord rises or Darkon is otherwise spared, one nightmare&rsquo;s end is likely another&rsquo;s beginning.</p>

<p>Every night brings another glittering affair in Dementlieu, whose citizens live glamorous and exciting lives. They enjoy the finest clothes, elegant jewels, grand ballroomsâ€”and most extravagantly, the Grand Masquerade hosted by Duchess Saidra d&rsquo;Honaire every seventh day at her island estate. Everyone who is <em>anyone</em> attends the duchess&rsquo;s balls, and everyone who longs to be someone tries to wrangle an invitation or sneak in uninvited. But Duchess Saidra&rsquo;s wrath upon those who dare to set foot where they don&rsquo;t belong is truly horribleâ€”and inevitably fatal.</p>
<p>The domain of Dementlieu consists of the city of Port-a-Lucine, which embraces the murky waters of Pernault Bay and Lucine Bay, as well as shifting scraps of fog-shrouded suburban areas around the city. Port-a-Lucine is a festering mire of rot and decay hidden beneath a glittering facade of decadent wealth. Everything appears more valuable, more solid, and more wholesome than the actuality, and everyone behaves as if the illusion of grandeur and prosperity were real.</p>
<p>Everyone in Dementlieu sweats to get by, but admitting to reality means social ruin. The poorest citizens struggle to maintain a middle-class appearance, scrounging through garbage heaps at night to find wares to sell in their shops in the morning. The members of the true middle class pretend to be titled aristocracy, but they wear much-patched and mended clothes, and starve for a week to host a ball that barely passes as lavishâ€”by recycling table scraps into mysterious pÃ¢tÃ©s and cleverly disguised dumplings. The real aristocracy of the domain exists solely in its Darklord, Duchess d&rsquo;Honaire.</p>
<p>Anyone who lets the mask slip meets a grisly end. When an &ldquo;aristocrat&rdquo; at the duchess&rsquo;s masquerade loses a button from a fraying coat, the duchess pronounces the impostor&rsquo;s doom and the unmasked pretender crumbles to dust. When a struggling merchant fails to keep up appearances, the resulting fall is less public but no less final. Left with no home and no livelihood, these wretches inevitably fall prey to the Red Death. This mysterious spirit haunts the poorest parts of town and drains every glimmer of life from its victimsâ€”and is embodied by Duchess Saidra.</p>

Dapper orcs and down-on-their-luck drow would be equally at home in this fairytale domain. The naming conventions often take broad inspiration from the French language. When players create characters from Dementlieu, ask them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever attended the Grand Masquerade</strong>? Did you come from an aristocratic family honored with invitations to the ball, or did you sneak in and successfully avoid discovery? Did you see someone being unmasked?</p>
<p><strong>How much of an impostor are you?</strong> Everyone in Dementlieu pretends to be something they&rsquo;re not. Your family pretended to greater wealth and status than their means. Is the rest of your life a lie? How much of it do you feel is a lie? Do you suspect you are unqualified for your class or background? Do you pretend to be better than your actual skills and abilities allow? Do you claim capabilities you lack entirely?</p>
<p><strong>Do you owe anything to a fairy godmother?</strong> The fey who live in the Three Odd Gables at the north edge of town sometimes aid people in perpetrating their deceptions; maybe they helped you. Did you look for them, or did one of them come to you? What aid did they offer? What seemingly reasonable price did they ask in return? How is it proving difficult to repay? Are you now a hexblood (see chapter 1) because of this?</p>

<ul>
<li>The city&rsquo;s decadent aristocrats keep a busy social calendar, fluttering like butterflies to multiple events each day: museum and art gallery exhibitions, concerts and play performances, brunches, luncheons, teas, dinners, and especially balls.</li>
<li>Every week brings the preeminent social event of the city: the Grand Masquerade, hosted by Duchess Saidra d&rsquo;Honaire. Invitations are coveted, and attendees outnumber the invitations.</li>
<li>Nothing in Dementlieu is as it appears. Everyone pretends to be wealthier than they are. Magical illusions hide disrepair, and lies great and small fill everyday communication. Everyone knows these truths, but no one dares speak of them.</li>
<li>The day-to-day administration of Port-a-Lucine rests in the hands of Lord Governor Marcel Guignol. He hears counsel from a group of five advisors drawn from the ranks of the aristocracy, including Duchess Saidra. With this council, he writes laws that a small city watch helps him enforce. He also serves as the sole judge when those laws are broken.</li>
<li>Decorative masks are a common accessory in Dementlieu, worn at social events and in daily life alike. Many people know their neighbors by their masks better than by their faces.</li>

Dedicated to the god Ezra, the cathedral&rsquo;s teachings put greater emphasis on weeping for the horrors of the world than on taking any action to cure or combat them. The clergy resists acknowledging any kind of distinction of class or rank among the worshipers, despite the stark stratification of society outside the cathedral&rsquo;s walls. All people are desperate wretches in the merciful hands of Ezra, who mourns for and with them all. A magnificent alabaster statue of Ezra, her sword and shield set aside as she weeps into her hands, adorns the sanctuary.</p>

A gigantic statue of a spider, painted in garish crimson with a black hourglass shape on its abdomen, adorns the front roof of the building, inviting customers into its decadent web. At this shrine to decadent pleasures, attendees celebrate beauty and life in defiance of the crushing poverty and horror outside.</p>
<p>But the theater harbors horrors nonetheless: shape-shifters use the cabaret&rsquo;s intimate spaces to find prey. Though rumors persist of shape-shifting giant spiders that feast on unwitting customers, they fail to depress attendance at the theater&rsquo;s performances.</p>

These fey delight in meddling in the lives of Dementlieu&rsquo;s citizens, adopting disguises as kindly grandmothers and using their magic to help impoverished people pass as well-to-do aristocrats or attend the Grand Masquerade. Their price seems perfectly reasonable, until their clients discover a hidden catch.</p>

But no one has been outside the city, no goods arrive from beyond the city, and Chateaufaux does not exist. The Mists creep close to the walls of Port-a-Lucine, occasionally exposing shifting patches of forests and meadows, but nothing more.</p>

Her father called her &ldquo;Duchess,&rdquo; claiming that he was a duke exiled from his rightful home by a vicious younger brother. The young girl took pleasure in lording that fact over other peasant children, proclaiming herself superior by birth despite her present circumstances. Saidra had no friends but many playmates, as she bullied other children into entertaining her.</p>
<p>When Saidra was a teenager, her father married a prosperous merchant with two daughters a few years older than Saidra. Though her father urged the three girls to love each other as sisters, his new wife and her daughters scorned Saidra, mocking her claims to nobility and treating her as a servant. Despite the family&rsquo;s new wealth, Saidra continued to dress in rags and labor from dawn to dusk, acting as a housemaid to her stepmother and stepsisters.</p>
<p>A harder blow descended when Saidra&rsquo;s stepmother casually mentioned the death of a duke who ruled nearby. Saidra asked if this duke was her father&rsquo;s wicked brother, and if his demise meant her father could reclaim his title. Her stepmother and stepsisters laughed at her, and her father admitted the truth. He had been only a servant in the duke&rsquo;s household and fled when he was caught trying to steal silver from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Saidra refused to accept this bitter truth. Fleeing the house, she went to her mother&rsquo;s grave and begged the departed spirit to aid her. A kind, grandmotherly figure appeared and granted Saidra&rsquo;s wish, bestowing on her a magnificent gown and fine jewels to attend the masquerade ball that celebrated the coronation of the new duke. Saidra rode to the ball in a stately conjured carriage, determined to kill the duke and claim his title.</p>
<p>At the ball, the glamour around Saidra made her irresistible to the duke, and they danced together for hours. Saidra began to contemplate an alternative to murdering the duke: she could marry the poor fool and become the duchess she&rsquo;d always believed herself to be.</p>
<p>But as the clock struck midnight, terror stalked the ball as guests started rapidly sickening and dying. The plague afflicted the duke and Saidra as well. As they lay dying in each other&rsquo;s arms, the duke gasped a fateful confession: he was not the son of the late duke, but of a servant in the duke&rsquo;s household. The duke, unable to have children of his own, claimed the servant&rsquo;s infant son and raised him. Later, that servant was caught stealing from the kitchen and fled the house with his young daughter.</p>
<p>Enraged to discover this &ldquo;duke&rdquo; was no more a real duke than her fatherâ€”and worse, that he was her brother, Saidra drew her blade and drove it into the pretender&rsquo;s heart. She stumbled out of the palace, but the plague claimed her on the stairs.</p>
<p>Saidra awoke on the foggy grounds of her new estate in Port-a-Lucine, a true duchess, as she had always imagined, but also an undead wraith. When she&rsquo;s dressed in elegant gowns and an elaborate mask, those around her accept the obvious lie that she&rsquo;s a living woman. When she isn&rsquo;t hosting her masquerade balls, she sheds her garb and stalks the city as a murderous spirit known as the Red Death. In either form, her goal is the same: to unmask and destroy pompous fools who pretend to be what they are not, aspire to higher station than they deserve, and fail to maintain the appearance of normalcy.</p>

She&rsquo;s a crimson spirit with statistics similar to a wraith. She can cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 18) on any creature that reveals themself to be lying about who they are. In her guise as duchess, Saidra dons a bird-like mask and fashionable scarlet gowns. As the Red Death, she is nothing more than a crimson-tinged shadow.</p>

Rather, those who try to leave find themselves roaming the lands of Chateaufaux. Stately houses stand atop gently rolling hills amid lush farmlands and vineyards, but the houses never get any closer, no matter how long one travels. And sooner or later, travelers always find themselves back on the outskirts of Port-a-Lucine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Saidra is plagued by the fear of being unmasked and having the truth of her origins revealed. She projects her insecurity outward, accusing others of her own sin as she delights in unmasking frauds and social climbers.</li>
<li>While hunting the streets as the Red Death, Saidra seeks her lost family. She resents but longs for her father, but she still fears her stepmother and stepsisters. She occasionally receives vague letters in their handwriting Chateaufaux.</li>
<li>As a wraith, Saidra is incapable of enjoying the pleasures her station affords her. No matter how lavish her parties, the fact of her true form taints every moment of the charade.</li>

As the characters navigate the anxious social scene of Port-a-Lucine, they play out echoes of familiar tales. The green hags who live in the Three Odd Gables serve as &ldquo;fairy godmothers&rdquo; to any character who wants to dress up for the duchess&rsquo;s ball, but the hags don&rsquo;t bestow their favors freely. Their gifts comes with strict conditions, such as a requirement to leave the ball by midnight or a demand to humiliate another attendee. The hags scheme to ruin mortal lives for their own pleasure, so their every act of apparent kindness is calculated toward that end. See &ldquo;The Grand Masquerade&rdquo; for suggestions of how to run Dementlieu&rsquo;s premier social event.</p>
<p>As adventurers interact with people in Port-a-Lucine, they find everyone obsessed with status. Outsiders new to the city are an unknown quantity, and people try to quickly identify their relative social status. Characters can easily pass as aristocrats, particularly if they flaunt their wealth and claim ancestral lands in Chateaufaux. But if they admit to a lower social status, or if their poor manners reveal their inferior quality, they become targets of derision and the city&rsquo;s social scene closes to them.</p>

<p>For the people of Port-a-Lucine, attending the Grand Masquerade signals a victory in their ceaseless quest for status. Visiting Duchess Saidra&rsquo;s estate, tasting her refreshments, moving in her social circle, and dancing to the music of her first-class orchestra are delights to be savoredâ€”and entirely worth the risk of discovery. To adventurers, though, these delights might not be sufficient motivation to take that risk. The Grand Masquerade is a fantastic adventure backdrop, but not a complete adventure. Adventurers need a good reason to attend; you can give them one by rolling on the Grand Masquerade Objectives table that follows. Link these objectives to larger adventures in Dementlieu, such as those growing from the seeds on the Dementlieu Adventures table.</p>

<p>Once the characters have a reason to be at the Grand Masquerade, they face a series of dangerous trials as they navigate the social intricacies of the ball. Common challenges include securing an invitation, acquiring a costume, navigating social niceties, and dancing. Random complications can arise at any point during the ball, heightening the constant risk of unmasking.</p>

Tension builds throughout the week as members of the aristocracy wait to see whether they&rsquo;ll make the list. The duchess&rsquo;s servants deliver invitations two days before the event.</p>
<h6 id=invitations>
<a href=#invitations class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Invitations</h6><p>If the characters have established themselves in Port-a-Lucine as important, wealthy, and interesting people, they receive genuine invitations. The duchess hears about them if they spend lavishly, or as your adventure demands. Forging an invitation requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence check.</p>
<h6 id=costumes>
<a href=#costumes class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Costumes</h6><p>A basic costume with a simple mask costs 5 gp. But elaborate costumes are a status symbol, and shoddy costumes attract unwanted attention. Ultimately, the characters decide how much to spend (or the hags of the Three Odd Gables can provide elaborate costumes for &ldquo;free&rdquo;).</p>
<h6 id=arriving-at-the-masquerade>
<a href=#arriving-at-the-masquerade class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Arriving at the Masquerade</h6><p>When the characters arrive at the duchess&rsquo;s estate, the Darklord&rsquo;s ghoul servants check invitations and outfits at the doors. They refuse entry to anyone missing acceptable versions of either. Ask the characters to make Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) checks if they present false invitations or have expressed worry that their costumes are subpar, but unless they roll especially poorly, the check simply reinforces the fear of being caught.</p>
<h4 id=social-niceties>
<a href=#social-niceties class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Social Niceties</h4><p>Once inside the Grand Masquerade, the characters must observe a host of unwritten rules of etiquette and act like they know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing at all times. Other guests make idle conversation and assume that characters know people throughout the city. At the first hint that a character might not belong at the masquerade, guests start loudly asking pointed questions, attracting increasing notice.</p>
<p>Allow the characters to employ the following tactics in their interactions at the Grand Masquerade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters can keep a close eye on how other people behave and mimic that behavior. Use Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks to measure how keenly they observe the partygoers' deportment, and Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) checks to deduce the right behavior for a particular situation.</li>
<li>Characters can apply magic or intuition to discern the response or behavior that a questioner expects. Use Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) checks unless characters have access to mind-reading spells such as <wc-fetch type=spell>detect thoughts</wc-fetch> or similar magic.</li>
<li>Characters can fake it &lsquo;til they make it. Use Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) checks extensively as characters work their way through the ball. Failed checks draw increased attention; on successful checks, the questioners lose interest.</li>
<li>Characters can distract watchers to shift attention if things go badly. Use Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) or Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Sleight of Hand</wc-fetch>) checks (or any other reasonable skill checks the players suggest) to determine whether they turn the focus away from their errors.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=dancing>
<a href=#dancing class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Dancing</h4><p>Port-a-Lucine&rsquo;s high society has an established canon of dances that everyone knows and performs competently. These include paired dances and group dances, and involve dancing with a bewildering number of people over the course of the evening. Dancing is an opportunity to seize a fleeting connection with an important contactâ€”and a chance to make a fatal error that results in being unmasked.</p>
<p>Characters might try to learn the basic dances as they prepare for the Grand Masquerade, but no outsider can hope to learn every step in as little as a week. Like navigating the social niceties of the gathering, fumbling through a dance involves careful observation and skilled fakery, plus the added ingredients of natural grace and agility. Allow characters to make Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) or Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Performance</wc-fetch>) checks to see if they pull off the stepsâ€”either through natural agility (Dexterity) or though their ability to make their moves look good anyway (Charisma).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A piercing voice cuts through the noise of the ball. The music stops and conversations hush as all eyes turn to Duchess Saidra and the poor fool she&rsquo;s confronted. The mask falls from his terror-struck face as the duchess raises her hand. &ldquo;You dare intrude into the sanctity of my home?&rdquo; she intones. A hunched, ghoulish footman clutching a dustpan scrambles forward. &ldquo;You defile my Grand Masquerade with your unworthy presence? I condemn you.&rdquo; With those words, a chill wave emanates from the duchess, and the unmasked figure crumbles to dust.</p>
<p>The duchess turns away, the ghoulish footman starts sweeping up the mess, and everyone around you pointedly returns to their own business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the adventurers attract the duchess&rsquo;s wrath, they are unlikely to cower in fear as she pronounces her judgment and gathers the energy to destroy them. They might try to flee, which could lead to a chase involving Saidra&rsquo;s servants or guests. If the characters attack Duchess Saidra, even if defeated she won&rsquo;t remain so for long unless she is first unmasked as a fraud. Not doing so terminally hampers the characters&rsquo; entrance to Dementlieuse society.</p>

<p>The days of the living are numbered in Falkovnia. The people would flee if they could, taking their chances in the Mists, but they aren&rsquo;t allowed that choice. The military has turned against the people, making them prisoners within their own country. With cudgel and pike, the soldiers of Falkovnia force every commoner into grueling labor, rushing them to raise fortifications and scrape scrawny roots from the dirt. Every lash strike, every day of meager rations is necessaryâ€”or so the soldiers claimâ€”because time is short and the dead are coming.</p>
<p>Falkovnia is a land besieged. Empty countryside surrounds ruined or crumbling cities. A few desperate pockets of civilization survive, carrying on not out of hope, but out of fear of the land&rsquo;s merciless soldiers. Led by General Vladeska Drakov, Falkovnia&rsquo;s military organizes a desperate and occasionally effective defense against an implacable foe: the ever-growing armies of the dead.</p>
<p>Every month a new zombie legion issues from the Mists. Never emerging from the same place twice, the horde sweeps across the land, drawn to the densest populations of the living. That&rsquo;s currently the Falkovnian capital of Lekar, where unfit and underfed conscripts defend crumbling walls alongside General Drakov and her crimson-armored elite soldiers, the Talons. Causalities stack up during the zombie sieges, but miracles and moments of valor have not abandoned Falkovnia. The people&rsquo;s numbers dwindle, but they soldier on.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of an attack, the Falkovnians burn their dead, repair what they can, and whisper that now might be the time to flee. Invariably, though, someone speaks too loudly and a so-called traitor is impaled upon Lekar&rsquo;s walls. The people might want to abandon their homes, but Vladeska Drakov will not know defeat.</p>

Such individuals have likely seen horrors and know tragedy. Falkovnia&rsquo;s residents often have brown hair and varied skin tones with warm undertones. Their names are broadly inspired by the German language. When players create characters from Falkovnia, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>How did you escape the Falkovnian military?</strong> Were you separated from your unit? Were you sacrificed or left for dead as part of a military strategy? Did you abandon or betray your unit? Were you once considered a Trueborn, or do you have a Blood Falcon tattoo?</p>
<p><strong>How did you escape the zombie hordes?</strong> Were you lucky enough not to encounter the undead? Did you defeat animate corpses or flee from them? Did you fall but somehow escape notice by the undead? Did they, for some remarkable reason, ignore you?</p>
<p><strong>What do you care for in Lekar?</strong> You know Lekar&rsquo;s days are numbered; any day now the zombies will sweep over the city&rsquo;s last defenders. Do you want to stop them to save loved ones? Do you want to prevent the hordes from destroying your life&rsquo;s work? Do you know of something in Lekar that can save Falkovnia&rsquo;s people?</p>

<ul>
<li>Every month, on the night of the new moon, thousands of zombies appear from the Mists and invade Falkovnia.</li>
<li>Ruins cover Falkovniaâ€”cities and villages crushed by zombie hordes and haunted by undead stragglers.</li>
<li>Elite Falkovnian soldiers known as Talons patrol the land, hunting for deserters, looters, and strangers to press into service. Talon officers bear the Blood Falcon, the symbol of Vladeska Drakov, tattooed prominently on their bodies.</li>
<li>There is only one punishment for any crime in Falkovnia: impalement.</li>
<li>Individuals earn public or military esteem for special acts of heroism. Dubbed &ldquo;Trueborn of Falkovnia,&rdquo; these national heroes are treated well, but the fickle public turns against them if they&rsquo;re perceived as not doing enough to end the undead invasion.</li>

The old city outgrew its walls multiple times since its founding, leaving its districts divided by fortifications. During the First Siege of Lekar, General Drakov sacrificed the entirety of the northern River Ward, leaving hundreds of souls to be slaughtered but allowing the remaining defenders to turn back the zombie horde.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s survivors face harsh conditions. Talon soldiers patrol the walls and the streets, keeping peace in the cramped slums that now fill the city. Troops lead civilians outside the walls to scavenge from ruined settlements and work the fields of abandoned farms, but their harvests are never enough for the city&rsquo;s survivors. Though bitter and desperate, soldiers live marginally better than civilians, being assured of daily rations and housing in the Bastion Wardâ€”the Talons-only district around city hall where General Drakov established her command center. From here, Drakov orders daily public executions as conscripts dispense supplies to the masses, and she plans how to resist the next zombie attack.</p>

The fields surrounding it remain strangely fertile, making them a prime destination for bands of farmers dispatched from Lekar. The Talons keep an outpost hidden beneath the town&rsquo;s ruins, under the command of one of General Drakov&rsquo;s surviving aides, the brilliant arcanist and scientist Vjorn Horstman. Horstman runs the post as his personal laboratory, obsessively striving to create new weapons to help Drakov win her war.</p>

The survivors are unified in their commitment to silence, to avoid attracting the notice of zombiesâ€”and whoever makes their home in the ominously lit Dekovan Palace overlooking the ruins.</p>

Called &ldquo;sentries of death,&rdquo; these trees inspire grim stories suggesting that their wood is haunted or their roots reach into the realm of the dead. In contrast, a ring of pale sentry trees stands in the depths of the Vigila Forest. Tales tell that none who enter the ring survive. The zombie plague seems to offer proof of their truth: few undead emerge from the forest, and those that do are entirely skeletonized.</p>

She and her troops executed a thousand ancient grudges and petty atrocities in a land of bitterly feuding royal families. Infamous but respected, Drakov amassed a fortune and planned to retire young, buying a title and a realm to rule.</p>
<p>The sacking of Yeivere changed her plans. During that city&rsquo;s razing, Drakov&rsquo;s mercenaries went a step too far. The Falcon&rsquo;s Talons killed a unique soul during their slaughter. None can say who the soul wasâ€”a prince, a saint, a witch, an angelâ€”but with its death, the world turned against them.</p>
<p>The ruling families united to hunt the Talons. Thanks to her tactical genius, Drakov repelled her pursuers and went on the offensive. One by one she attacked her former benefactors, burning villages, pressing citizens into service, and impaling anyone with a drop of noble blood. Though it took years, Drakov forged a bloody empire. But while sacking the burning city of her last remaining foe, Drakov and her troops were engulfed by strange smoke. When it cleared, everything they knew was gone.</p>
<p>Transported to an unfamiliar land, Drakov and her troops wasted little time subjugating it. The realm fell quickly, even easily, and upon taking the city of Lekar, Drakov prepared to name herself ruler of her new empire: Falkovnia.</p>
<p>Then, under a moonless sky, the dead rose against the land&rsquo;s invaders. The surrounding villages fell to the zombies with hardly a sound, and undead claws scraped Lekar&rsquo;s walls before the first alarms were raised. The First Siege of Lekar raged for four days. Drakov&rsquo;s strategies, both brilliant and desperate, eventually turned back the zombie horde, but at the cost of most of her veteran troops.</p>
<p>Since then, Drakov has lost nearly her entire nation. Every month a new desperate battle unfolds. She prepares ceaselessly for each, certain of her plans and ultimate victory, but doubting the mettle of her troops. With threats and public, impalings she tries to keep her people more terrified of her than of the undead. And with every new moon she faces an unconquerable foe, never revealing to anyone that each zombie bears the familiar, rotting face of an innocent her soldiers once put to the sword.</p>

As an occupying force, the Talons are terrifying. Their numbers are relatively few, but they&rsquo;re organized enough to oppress Lekar&rsquo;s ragged survivors and enforce Drakov&rsquo;s totalitarian laws. In the face of zombie hordes, though, they&rsquo;re fighting a losing battle against foes whose numbers only grow. And every time a Talon falls, Lekar&rsquo;s final defeat grows closer. Talon soldiers use the guard stat block, while commanders are Veteran.</p>

Drakov&rsquo;s troops carry out example-setting impalings as punishment for even the slightest crimes. These executions serve the greater good and impose necessary order, but make it clear that zombies aren&rsquo;t the realm&rsquo;s only monsters.</p>

This sets the stage for countless bad decisions, from leaders making terrible sacrifices or permitting amoral acts to individuals making fatalistic choices. Everyone in Falkovnia behaves as if it&rsquo;s their last day aliveâ€”because it probably is.</p>

Anyone who enters the Mists surrounding Falkovnia encounters an endless number of zombies. Even if travelers somehow avoid these shambling corpses, they emerge from the Mists back in Falkovnia, pursued by an undead mob. For one week every month, though, following the night of the new moon, the Mists surrounding Falkovnia are empty of zombies and the borders open. During this time, Drakov sends patrols of Talons to sweep the edges of the Mists for deserters. These patrols are difficult to avoid and battles with them often attract zombies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Vladeska knows it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until zombies overrun Lekar. She has no time for rest or deliberation; every moment must be used to the fullest before the hordes return. Every wasted second is a life lost.</li>
<li>Vladeska refuses to flee. She knows doing so could save many of Lekar&rsquo;s people, but it would mean admitting failureâ€”a fate worse than death.</li>
<li>Vladeska recognizes every zombie&rsquo;s face, knowing they&rsquo;re her own fallen soldiers, the defenders of communities she razed, or murdered civilians. She doesn&rsquo;t understand why this is, but she knows the zombies are coming for her alone.</li>

She believes a foe from her past is responsible for the endless zombie attacks and quietly looks for trustworthy agents to find the zombies' source.</p>

Characters might be harried by zombie pursuit across the empty countryside or asked to defend the last holdout of civilization against a relentless horde. The zombies could serve as direct threats or motivate others to monstrous deeds, with the ends supposedly justifying the means.</p>
<p>You determine the composition and behavior of the zombie hordes of Falkovnia. The zombies emerge from the Mists on the night of the new moon and trudge toward the last holdouts of civilization. Whether they move in a single wave or scatter into smaller bands, this surge brings a monthly threat to besiege the walls of Lekar.</p>
<p>When creating zombie encounters, consider the average level of your group and what threats you want to represent. The &ldquo;Zombie&rdquo; entry in chapter 5 presents a variety of zombie types to complement the shambling zombie of the Monster Manual, posing greater threats or terrifying surprises. The horde can also include other corporeal Undead such as Skeleton, Ghoul, or Wight. Alternatively, the &ldquo;zombies&rdquo; might not be Undead at all but another group attempting to lay claim to Falkovniaâ€”perhaps a forgotten human culture or relentless giants.</p>
<p>Falkovnia is one of the few domains where the characters and the land&rsquo;s Darklord theoretically represent the same side, united against the zombies. The characters might defend Drakov&rsquo;s people and enact her defensive measures, but might also try to subvert her Pyrrhic strategies or attempt to smuggle survivors to safe locations outside Lekar. Consider exploring plots in which the characters rise in the Darklord&rsquo;s esteem as Trueborn of Falkovnia, but then must walk the line of both keeping Drakov&rsquo;s trust and upholding their principles.</p>
<p>Consider the plots on the Falkovnia Adventures table when planning adventures in this domain.</p>

If you plan to involve characters in Vladeska Drakov&rsquo;s war against the undead, first consider how they become involved. The following examples are just a few of the possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Forced Conscripts.</b> The characters run into an overwhelming force of Talons and are absorbed into its ranks. When zombies appear at the city wall, the characters are offered their freedom in return for defending the city.</li>
<li><b>Last Bastion.</b> Far from Lekar, the characters fall in with local survivors who say the city is the country&rsquo;s last safe bastion. Upon arriving, they discover the sanctuary is not what they&rsquo;d hoped.</li>
<li><b>Missed Connection.</b> The characters come to Falkovnia having heard tales of it before the land&rsquo;s zombie uprising. An individual or item they seek is now in Lekar, forcing the characters to search the city and then escape.</li>
<li><b>Mindtaker Mists.</b> The Mists deposit the characters' consciousnesses into soldiers, Talon officers, or unprepared peasants preparing for the siege. Consult the &ldquo;Survivors&rdquo; section of chapter 4 for suggestions on how to represent soldiers bound to face the horde.</li>
</ul>

They join hundreds of unprepared defenders, including Commoner holding clubs or longbows for the first time.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of the siege, determine where the characters will be positioned among the city&rsquo;s fortifications or on the streets. The specifics of these locations don&rsquo;t matterâ€”no precision tactics will change the characters' fortunes against the zombie horde. Allow the characters to strategize however they please, though.</p>

As terrible events unfold around the characters, it&rsquo;s up to them to determine who and how they&rsquo;ll help.</p>
<p>Begin the siege with zombies approaching Lekar&rsquo;s walls. The characters might pick off distant zombies or enact plans to destroy dozens at a time. The characters' strategies are likely successful, but the horde soon begins overwhelming defenses nearby. Once the characters defeat a few zombies, roll <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> and consult the Zombie Siege Encounters table. The event rolled unfolds within sight of one of the characters. It&rsquo;s up to the characters to either take action or let the event transpire. When the characters complete an encounter, roll on the table again. If the characters ignore one of these events, the defenders' situation worsens. Add +2 to the next roll on the table.</p>
<p>The siege lasts as long as you like. Use frantic rushes between emergencies to describe small horrors and victories while wearing down the characters' resources with brief zombie attacks. If the characters feel completely overwhelmed, Talon Priest with <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Healing</wc-fetch> might appear, or an officer can enlist characters to deliver orders from General Drakov (likely related to the siege&rsquo;s climax).</p>
<p>As the battle reaches what you determine to be the halfway point, start rolling <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> on the Zombie Siege Encounters table and consult the &ldquo;Concluding the Siege&rdquo; section to guide the battle toward its climax.</p>

<p>Drakov&rsquo;s scheme might be even more alarming, involving magical or monstrous secret weapons.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve determined how the siege will unfold, start foreshadowing Drakov&rsquo;s scheme, giving the characters the opportunity to aid it, enact a less destructive plan, or save innocents. Use missives intercepted from messengers or a <wc-fetch type=item>Sending Stones</wc-fetch> taken from a fallen Talon officer to clue the party in on Drakov&rsquo;s strategy.</p>

<p>The sands of time bury the desert realm of Har&rsquo;Akir. Here, the wonders of fallen empires and pyramids of forgotten pharaohs crumble beneath a merciless sun. Untold generations of tombs and secrets lie beneath the sands, markers of a history the land&rsquo;s few residents know of only in story and song. Their interest in past splendor is smothered, as life is harsh in Har&rsquo;Akir and the living exist only to serve a deathless god-king.</p>
<p>This realm of fierce deserts and mysterious monuments is ruled by the mummy Ankhtepot, speaker for the gods and immortal pharaoh. From his golden pyramid in the City of the Dead, the Darklord watches over his domain, careless of the passage of mortal lives as he sends his servants in search of his only remaining desire: his <em>ka</em>, the missing piece of his fractured soul.</p>
<p>As the pharaoh obsesses over his lost treasure and thoughts of escaping his impossibly long undead existence, his servants plague the domain in his name. In hidden tomb-courts, withered, animal-headed elder mummies known as the Children of Ankhtepot luxuriate as emissaries of false gods. And in the mud brick city of Muhar, the priests of morbid gods oversee all aspects of life, apportioning food and blessings to the worthy and punishing blasphemers. But all the pharaoh&rsquo;s servants also pursue his quest to find his mysterious lost treasure, and are ever desperate for some clue or news to placate Ankhtepot and spare them from the storms of his wrath and his buried legions of the ancient dead.</p>

<ul>
<li>Har&rsquo;Akir is a land of vast deserts and deadly storms. Water is scarce beyond the land&rsquo;s few oases and the city of Muhar.</li>
<li>The land is ruled by Pharaoh Ankhtepot, the immortal intermediary between the mortals and the gods. The pharaoh rules from his pyramid, Pharaoh&rsquo;s Rest, in the City of the Dead.</li>
<li>The people worship a pantheon of strict gods (see &ldquo;Gods of Har&rsquo;Akir&rdquo; later in this section). The priests of these gods oversee all aspects of labor, agriculture, trade, justice, and religion in the pharaoh&rsquo;s name.</li>
<li>The monuments, tombs, and pyramids of past golden ages litter Har&rsquo;Akir. These countless tombs are interconnected, forming a vast, semi-hidden underground network called the Labyrinth.</li>
<li>Akirran death rituals call for removing the heart, draining the body of blood, and wrapping the remains in linen. These methods preserve the body so the pharaoh might call it to service. It is a crime to burn the dead.</li>
<li>Akirrans value music, and many locals are accomplished singers or proficient in playing the reed pipe, goblet drum, or arched harp.</li>

Most of the land&rsquo;s people have dark hair and a variety of warm skin tones favoring golden to deep brown and black shades, and names with Egyptian inspirations. When players create characters from Har&rsquo;Akir, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>How do you survive in the desert realm?</strong> Are you a laborer in the fields or camps surrounding Muhar? Are you a scribe or priest of Har&rsquo;Akir&rsquo;s gods? Are you a trader who travels the land or a member of the desert-dwellers known as Sute&rsquo;s Chosen?</p>
<p><strong>What role does music play in your life?</strong> Do you prefer to sing, dance, or play an instrument? What animal, hero, god, or past pharaoh is evoked in your favorite song? How do others feel about your performances?</p>
<p><strong>How do the gods feature in your life?</strong> Are you a devout follower of all the gods of Har&rsquo;Akir, or do you favor a single deity? Do you worship only as you must to gain food and protection from the priests? Do you secretly worship a deity other than the gods of Har&rsquo;Akir?</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Muhar Oasis.</b> The largest oasis shares a name with the city of Muhar, which sits upon its southern shore. Gazelles and herons frequent its northern shore, often attracting predators such as crocodiles, hyenas, chimeras, and giant scorpions.</li>
<li><b>Red Oasis.</b> Har&rsquo;Akir&rsquo;s people say this oasis&rsquo;s waters are poison, as the oasis was given by the gods to the beasts of the land. Prides of cunning lions hunt nearby, frequently washing their kills here.</li>
<li><b>Sek&rsquo;s Tears.</b> The waters of this oasis are said to be able to heal any affliction, but they are guarded by the sphinxes who dwell in the nearby canyons.</li>
<li><b>White Oasis.</b> Holy to the god Neb, the White Oasis is surrounded by rich deposits of limestone favored in the creation of monuments and tombs. A largely disused quarry nearby now shelters a community of recluses called River&rsquo;s Shelter. All of the residents expect to die soon, for one reason or another, and seek to cleanse themselves with the White Oasis&rsquo;s waters before meeting their end.</li>

The Temple of Ese towers over the city, its limestone walls glinting like a jewel in the sun. Here Akirrans worship, receive food shares, seek justice, and receive medicine or healing, all from the hands of High Priest Isu Rehkotep. The priest claims to speak for Pharaoh Ankhtepot in all matters, and her word is considered both royal decree and divine edict. In truth, though, the pharaoh cares little for the living so long as order is maintained, leaving Rehkotep to run Muhar largely as she pleases. Those who displease Rehkotep or oppose her priest-guards are thrown into the Mouth of Oru, a pit that connects to the Labyrinth.</p>

This pyramid is known as the spirit home of Ousa, partner of Ese and the god who rules in the afterlife. Akirrans whisper that the interior holds a door between this world and the land of the dead. In front of this wonder, a giant statue of Anu, the Great Jackal, overlooks parched riverbeds. A small order of jackal-masked priests guards entry to the pyramid.

Elaborated upon by the Dark Powers, these endless, entangled crypts are known as the Labyrinthâ€”a vast, dungeon-underworld that connects every tomb and monument in Har&rsquo;Akir. The Children of Ankhtepot and their undead servants make use of hidden thoroughfares connecting to the City of the Dead. But many less-traveled passages lie throughout the Labyrinth, forming a sprawling wilderness of crumbling, monster-haunted ruins and trap-laden passages. Within the deepest of these secret places lie crypts dedicated to gods that predate Pharaoh Ankhtepot&rsquo;s reign. A traitorous Child of Ankhtepot called Senmet also lurks within these passages, seeking ways to depose Ankhtepot and become the new pharaoh.</p>

Two mighty sandstorms rage over the region: the Breath of the Forgotten and the Breath of the False. These storms are said to impose tests from the gods on those who enter them, trials that punish those living lives without consequence or faith. They are also known to stop and rise without warning, obeying Ankhtepot&rsquo;s whims. Religious guides known as Sute&rsquo;s Chosen wander the region; the order&rsquo;s members claim to know how to read and navigate past the storms to reach the City of the Dead by the most expedient route.</p>

The densest collection of these crypts lines the monument- and temple-filled canyon called the City of the Dead. This necropolis climbs the canyon walls, where whole cliffs have been sculpted into massive statues of Har&rsquo;Akir&rsquo;s gods and pharaohs. Among these monuments hide entrances to ancient tombs, many of which belong to past high priests of Muhar and Children of Ankhtepot.</p>
<p>The City of the Dead rises toward the sculpted, golden mountain called Pharaoh&rsquo;s Rest, the massive pyramid of Pharaoh Ankhtepot. From here, the Darklord can see across much of the domain as he sends agents to hunt the missing piece of his soul.</p>

When the second pharaoh died, her unworthy son ascended to the throne. The new pharaoh quickly became unpopular among the people and priests. Seeking a remedy for this, Ankhtepot came to believe that the gods wanted another to take the pharaoh&rsquo;s place, one with knowledge of rule and the deities' blessing.</p>
<p>On the day of the ritual that would consecrate the pharaoh&rsquo;s connection with the gods, Ankhtepot rallied his loyal priests and murdered their liege. He had misjudged the peoples' loyalty, though, and they rose up and executed the traitorous priests.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Moreover, Ankhtepot had misjudged the will of his gods. As he stood before them in death, the immortals forsook him, cursing him and denying him entry to the afterlife. Instead, they returned him to the world, but stripped away a piece of his soul, his kaâ€”the vital essence that inspires all living beings.</p>
<p>Ankhtepot reawakened, trapped and paralyzed within his corpse as he was mummified along with his treacherous followers. The murderous priest felt the pain of every cut and every organ removed as if he were alive. Then, within an unmarked crypt, he suffered and starved for what felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>Untold years passed, but on the day the last memory of Ankhtepot&rsquo;s name faded from his homeland, a voice intruded on the priest&rsquo;s prison, asking if he still felt he was worthy to rule. Through the ages, Ankhtepot&rsquo;s arrogance hadn&rsquo;t waned, and he answered with certainty. Granted new freedom by the Dark Powers, Ankhtepot emerged from his crypt into the domain of Har&rsquo;Akir.</p>
<p>In this new land, Ankhtepot found a pious people devoted to the same gods he once served. Immediately he set to wiping out that religion, replacing it with new gods of his own imagining, false divinities for whom he alone spoke. Using blasphemous rites, Ankhtepot resurrected the priests once buried alongside him as powerful mummies, replacing their heads with those of beasts holy to his new faith. These Children of Ankhtepot served him as they did in life, and together the dead conquered the souls of Har&rsquo;Akir.</p>
<p>The ages have marched ever on. Ankhtepot has known treachery and conquest. He has known divinity and rule. But now he knows only boredom and despair. His sole remaining desire is to recover his lost ka, which he knows remains somewhere in Har&rsquo;Akir. With it, he hopes to become mortal again, die, and face his original gods' judgment once more. Whether this means peace or oblivion is meaningless to him. Ankhtepot seeks only an end.</p>

Beyond this, he rules as pharaoh, national leader, and voice of the gods. None in Har&rsquo;Akir, among the living or the dead, denies his will, but the Darklord&rsquo;s wishes are few. He cares only for order and to find his lost ka.</p>

He resurrected these Mummy and Mummy Lord with the heads of animals, painting them as spirits and harbingers of his fictitious gods of Har&rsquo;Akir. As Ankhtepot has grown bored with mortal concerns, the Children of Ankhtepot have pursued their own vices. Many dream and despair in their crypts. Others foment small cults of their own. And still others seek to undermine the pharaoh and claim his positionâ€”including the treacherous mummy lord Senmet.</p>

To that end, he relies on his priests to maintain peace in Har&rsquo;Akir and provide for the people. Should the populace grow discontent, Ankhtepot expects the priests to deal with discord swiftly. If they can&rsquo;t, he sends his mummy servants to indiscriminately quell any uprising. Examples of such massacres fill Har&rsquo;Akir&rsquo;s history, but they are known only to the domain&rsquo;s priests.</p>

Most priests believe themselves to be devout servants of the gods, having no idea that their deities are false. They keep alert for strangers and omens, reporting them to their superiors and, ultimately, High Priestess Isu Rehkotep. The high priestess dutifully watches for signs of a mysterious treasure her pharaoh seeks and orders any strangers in Har&rsquo;Akir brought to her at the Temple of Ese, but she also relishes her influence and decadent lifestyle. She dreads the day Ankhtepot blames her for not finding what he desires, though she has no idea she&rsquo;s searching for the Darklord&rsquo;s ka.</p>

Those who glimpse the pharaoh describe a withered corpse clad in black linen wrappings and gold adornments, with a voice like sand ground between clashing mountains. The only time he bothers with either the living or the dead is when they actively offend him (such as by trespassing upon his solitude at Pharaoh&rsquo;s Rest), when they bring him hope of finding his ever-elusive ka, or when disappointment kindles his rage.</p>

The land&rsquo;s central plotâ€”the search to find Pharaoh Ankhtepot&rsquo;s kaâ€”can lead adventurers to explore mysterious sites as they seek hiding places undisturbed for centuries. Consider running a tour of the domain&rsquo;s most intriguing locales, punctuated with treks across the brutal desertsâ€”landscapes fraught with hazards such as extreme heat, quicksand, and sandstorms whipped up by strong winds, all detailed in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. In the course of their adventures, characters can learn the truth of Ankhtepot&rsquo;s origins and Har&rsquo;Akir&rsquo;s original gods. How they use these discoveries is up to them, but each discovery should bring the characters closer to sealing Ankhtepot&rsquo;s doom or their own. &ldquo;The Darklord&rsquo;s Soul&rdquo; below provides ideas for running adventures focused on Ankhtepot&rsquo;s obsession, while the Har&rsquo;Akir Adventures table suggests other plots that might unfold in this domain.</p>

But the spiteful Darklord scoured the old religions from his domain, replacing them with parodies that make him and his followers central to the land&rsquo;s faith. Over generations, these deities have become the gods of Har&rsquo;Akir:</p>
<p><strong>Anu</strong>, who judges the fate of the dead</p>
<p><strong>Ese</strong>, who presides over life and the living</p>
<p><strong>Neb</strong>, who guards the path of the dead</p>
<p><strong>Oru</strong>, who orders the heavens and all beneath</p>
<p><strong>Ousa</strong>, who controls death and the dead</p>
<p><strong>Sek</strong>, who heals the sick and cultivates life</p>
<p><strong>Sute</strong>, who sows despair and discord</p>
<p>The Dark Powers have granted a measure of power to Ankhtepot&rsquo;s false gods. Clerics who worship one of Har&rsquo;Akir&rsquo;s gods or the pantheon as a whole receive power as if they worshiped a true deity that offers the death domain. Despite their distinct roles, traditions, and places within the lives of Har&rsquo;Akir&rsquo;s people, these gods are all especially aloof, cryptic, morbid, and supportive of the pharaoh&rsquo;s rule.</p>

Doing so requires a ritual with several components:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be performed in a specially prepared chamber at the heart of Ousa&rsquo;s Pyramid.</li>
<li>It must be performed for 1 hour, starting when the full moon is at its highest point.</li>
<li>If the ka exists within another being, it must be released at the ritual&rsquo;s climax, with the possessor being slain and granted the honor of mummification.</li>
<li>If the ka does not exist within another being, at the ritual&rsquo;s climax a worthy life must be extinguished to seal the ka to the rest of the pharaoh&rsquo;s soul.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ritual is enacted and watched over by the Darklord&rsquo;s servants, living priests, Children of Ankhtepot, and other deathless guardians. The Darklord and any required victim must remain present for the duration of the rite. If the ritual is disrupted, the ka escapes, fleeing the pyramid and potentially taking on another form. Even if the ka is recaptured, the ritual can&rsquo;t be performed again until the next full moon. In any case, Pharaoh Ankhtepot is furious if the ritual fails, taking his rage out on all presentâ€”and perhaps, all of Har&rsquo;Akir.</p>

<p>In Hazlan, magic is authority, justification for any excess, andâ€”for those without itâ€”the specter of inevitable doom. This domain is less a nation than a vast magical laboratory, whose wizard overlord Hazlik views every being as either an apprentice or a test subject. He conscripts those he acknowledges as lesser wizards into performing elaborate magical experiments, twisting the fabric of magic and reality until it frays. These experiments endlessly scar a domain drained of vitality, tortured by magical disasters, and overrun with abominations. The greatest wounds affect the invisible flows of magic underpinning the land, turning it erratic and dangerous.</p>
<p>Despite the domain&rsquo;s magical dangers, the ambitions of the spellcasting elite grow more audacious by the day. Paranoid and controlling, Hazlik watches the schemes of his lessers, observing them through the Eye of Hazlik. This pervasive eye-shaped symbol marks structures, decorations, clothing, and individuals, and through these eyes the Darklord sees all. He watches as common folk cower at the passage of his ostentatious apprentices. He watches as monstrosities birthed from strange experiments prowl openly. He watches as ravenous worms from deep within the poisoned land crawl to the surface in search of food. And he watches every new magical innovation, eager to claim it and add the discovery to his list of glorious achievements.</p>

<li>The wizard Hazlik rules Hazlan. His apprentices have free rein to exploit the land and its people to further their magical experiments.</li>
<li>Inhabitants claim the eyelike design called the Eye of Hazlik bears Hazlik&rsquo;s blessing and wards off dangerous magic.</li>
<li>Magic is unreliable in Hazlan, resulting in dangerous side effects.</li>
<li>The visible effects of magical disasters disfigure the domain, from rivers poisoned by alchemical runoff to craters caused by magical explosions.</li>
<li>Creatures warped by magical experiments infest the domain, including magic-hungry Gremishka (see chapter 5) and ravenous Purple Worm.</li>

When players create characters from Hazlan, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>What is your relationship with magic?</strong> Do you avoid magic, knowing the danger it represents? Did you learn enough to aid in practical activities or to set you apart from those with no magic? Did you embrace magic to join Hazlan&rsquo;s elite?</p>
<p><strong>Has magic altered you?</strong> Have you been affected by a magical disaster, pollution, or experimentation? Do you have an obvious Dark Gift or characteristic that sets you apart?</p>
<p><strong>Do you carry an Eye of Hazlik</strong>? This symbol of your people is said to ward off dangerous magic. Do you carry one as a talisman or bear one as a tattoo? Or do you hate the mark, viewing it as a symbol of magic-using oppressors?</p>

The waste from these industries fills the Burning River, named for the regularity with which the pollutants within it ignite, causing the waters to burn with colored flames. These toxins sicken the people of Ramulai, cause transformations among the regional wildlife, and created the swampland known as the Brew.</p>

Spellcasters obsessed with earning the Darklord&rsquo;s favor raise architecturally discordant towers that defy physical laws by floating, being accessible only by magic, or being larger on the inside than the outside. The town&rsquo;s residents magically create whatever they need, resulting in little need for trade. This leaves the labyrinthine streets and knotted bridges between intertwined compounds eerily empty. Common folk often disappear among these streets, the victims of magical guardians, escaped test subjects, or wizards who see the magically deficient as stock for their experiments.</p>

Toyalis boasts a population of poor but hardworking common folk united by their shared pursuit of prosperity and terror of the domain&rsquo;s magic-using elite. Although the townsfolk have no passion for magic, colorful murals and decorations depicting magical creatures, arcane symbols, and the Eye of Hazlik cover the town&rsquo;s rough wooden and adobe structures.</p>
<p>Several times each season, one of Hazlik&rsquo;s apprentices leads a procession of attendants and magical wonders to Toyalis in search of replacement servants, new apprentices, or stock for magical experiments. A carnival atmosphere ensues, with this apprentice displaying their magical accomplishments and setting up competitions to assess the locals. These contests involve tests of magical ingenuity, strangely themed talent shows, and open brawls. When the mage&rsquo;s procession leaves, it takes townsfolk deemed valuable with it.</p>

Anyone who steps into the fog falls as though into a ravine. Few who tumble in reemerge.</p>
<p>The vapors of the Lacuna are identical to the Mists that border the domain. The people of Hazlan know that the Lacuna used to be smaller, and that it was created by a magical disaster. The fog has since spread, extending in tendrils toward sources of powerful magic throughout the domain. Originally, the Lacuna reached exclusively toward Veneficus and the Mound of the Worm. Since then, Hazlik&rsquo;s apprentices have placed sprawling magical sigils upon the land, runes that slowed the Lacuna&rsquo;s growth but split its development in multiple directions.</p>

The Darklord dwells here alone, attended by a staff of servile constructs and magical creations. Although the palace features impressive audience chambers and decadent pleasure gardens, Hazlik rarely welcomes guests. Only his most accomplished apprentices attend him with any regularity. Apprentices who displease him never return from the Darklord&rsquo;s palace. Left to his solitude, Hazlik spends days at a time within his personal meditation chambers, avoiding sleep and using the Eyes of Hazlik throughout the domain to search for useful magicâ€”and to identify any who might be acting against him.</p>

The following are examples of the bizarre sites that dot the domain:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Brew.</b> This toxic marsh is poisoned by alchemical pollution from Ramulai and populated by sapient fungi and enraged plant creatures.</li>
<li><b>The Fleshless Forest.</b> Every plant and creature within this forest was turned to stone. The condition is infectious.</li>
<li><b>Moonstone Valley.</b> Meteors and otherworldly creatures crash in this wasteland during every new moon.</li>
<li><b>Mound of the Worm.</b> Land rose from deep underground to form this mesa, unleashing dozens of purple worms upon the surface. The aged albino worm Gravedrinker dominates this region.</li>
<li><b>The Orbitoclasts.</b> One of numerous floating rock formations in central Hazlik, it bears an uncanny resemblance to tools used in performing lobotomies.</li>
<li><b>The Playas.</b> These former lakes have been reduced to quicksand-riddled purple worm feeding grounds.</li>
<li><b>Seething.</b> This region is devoid of life, and its land crumbles away into the Mists.</li>

<p>The wizard Hazlik always stood one formula away from attaining his dreams. Raised among the merciless Red Wizards of Thay on the world of Toril, Hazlik steadily rose among the ranks of those obsessive, treacherous spellcasters. Eager and encouraged to push past the weakness of mortality, he sought to discover hidden truths of magic and its command of reality. He obsessed over radical pursuits, such as creating the perfect mortal form and visiting dream realms within an individual&rsquo;s psyche.</p>
<p>As Hazlik advanced in power, he developed rivalries with his fellow Red Wizards. Through petty contests, victories, and embarrassments, he grew increasingly arrogant, orchestrating events that left his rivals scarred by his spells or their own backfiring magic. During these feuds, there was one competitor Hazlik was unable to defeat: the Red Wizard Indreficus. Hazlik gradually came to fixate on Indreficus as his true rival. Indreficus shared Hazlik&rsquo;s genius and arrogance, and they spent many seasons as vicious adversaries and passionate lovers. They drove one another to feats of magical brilliance both revolutionary and unspeakable. For a time, the two ambitious wizards knew a wicked peace.</p>
<p>That ended when Hazlik discovered that Indreficus had gained the attention of the land&rsquo;s ruling zulkirs and planned to betray Hazlik to garner their favor. Heartbroken and enraged, Hazlik captured Indreficus and subjected him to a nightmarish experiment that left him permanently transformed into a pain-wracked living portal. Hazlik presented his creation to the zulkirs, planning to impress his people&rsquo;s rulers and gain their patronage.</p>
<p>Instead, the zulkirs revealed that Indreficus had not betrayed him. Rather, the zulkirs had watched the pair&rsquo;s ascent and, wary of their potential, sought to undermine them before they became threats. Moreover, they deemed Hazlik&rsquo;s transformation of Indreficus an abomination. As punishment, they ruled that every rival Hazlik had defeated could exact a penance of their choosing upon him. But even as the first brand-wielding member of the mob of Hazlik&rsquo;s scarred rivals approached to take their revenge, Hazlik fled through the groaning portal that had been Indreficus.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Hazlik emerged in a grim netherworld of fog and hateful visions where Indreficus&rsquo;s condemning voice hounded him mercilessly. Eventually, he escaped those nightmare lands into a realm that knew nothing of magic. He had changed, becoming covered in golden tattoos evocative of symbols that meant &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; in his homeland. Undaunted, Hazlik claimed the title of zulkir and dubbed his new world Hazlan.</p>

His lessons are infrequent, demanding, and filled with mocking examples. Those who don&rsquo;t impress him don&rsquo;t survive long. He encourages rivalries among his students and drives them to push the boundaries of magical possibilities. His goading results in magical wonders, failed experiments, and the magical disasters that plague the land. Hazlik claims his apprentices' successes as his own, both to hide his lack of innovation and to further his reputation as Hazlan&rsquo;s greatest wizard. His favoriteâ€”or least disappointingâ€”apprentices include the masked wizard Yhal the Skygazer, shadow-cloaked Ruzelo, and the daring genius Eleni.</p>

He pushes his apprentices to chip away at the nature of the land, hoping to find out what lies beyondâ€”and ultimately, to escape.

<ul>
<li>Since entering Hazlan, Hazlik hasn&rsquo;t been able to learn new magic. No matter how much he studies or researches new magical lore or spells, he cannot master them. He can use and prepare any spell he already knows but can no longer advance the magical research that formerly drove his life.</li>
<li>Vivid nightmares wherein Indreficus taunts him for his failures compound Hazlik&rsquo;s frustrations, and he avoids sleeping to prevent them. By employing rare herbs and tinctures, he can go for days without sleeping, but his stock needs regular replenishing. This cycle casts Hazlik between extremes of exhaustion, jitteriness, and paranoia.</li>
<li>Hazlik is terrified of others learning of his limitations. This leads him to berate and betray other wizards, claim magical discoveries as his own, and endlessly spy on both rivals and visitors to his realm.</li>
<li>Hazlik openly denies the various destructions afflicting his realm. At first, he didn&rsquo;t care that this strange world was being destroyed, expecting to escape it swiftly. As that seems increasingly unlikely, his dread clashes with his refusal to acknowledge that he&rsquo;s ever wrong.</li>

The result is a realm where supernatural disasters wrack the land and magic turns against the characters, forcing them to doubt abilities they previously took for granted. Here, no adventure site is too fantastical. Anything explainable as &ldquo;an evil wizard did it&rdquo; fits perfectly, and impossibilities that challenge adventurers of any level can arise. The &ldquo;Magic in the Dying Domain&rdquo; section that follows explores the unpredictability of magic in Hazlan, while the Hazlan Adventures table suggests other adventures that might unfold here.</p>

Commoners fear it but know it represents a path out of desperation, while the elite equate worth and magical skill.

Worse, visitors who don&rsquo;t understand the dangerous nature of magic in the domain might accidentally unleash magical ruin.</p>

</span></p>
<p>A stylized eyelike design adorns buildings, art, clothing, and talismans across Hazlan: the Eye of Hazlik. Locals claim the symbol wards off dangerous magic and offers protection from magical creatures. It&rsquo;s also said that spellcasters who wear the symbol are less likely to suffer the domain&rsquo;s wild magic effects. Remarkably, it&rsquo;s not all superstition.</p>
<p>An Eye of Hazlik takes a shape reminiscent of the eyelike tattoos that cover Hazlik&rsquo;s body. It can be any size and can be created from any medium: a tattoo, a medallion, an embroidered motif, or even a building-sized mural. Within the borders of Hazlan, an Eye of Hazlik has the following traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Eye of Hazlik is not magical.</li>
<li>Anyone who openly wears an Eye of Hazlik on their person or clothing or as a talisman can, once per day, choose not to roll on the Hazlan Wild Magic table.</li>
<li>Hazlik is aware of any spell cast or magic item used within his domain within 30 feet of an Eye of Hazlik. He is also aware of the spell&rsquo;s level and the rarity of such a magic item.</li>
<li>At any time, Hazlik can use any Eye of Hazlik in his domain as a stationary eye created by the <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane eye</wc-fetch> spell. He can spy through the eye whenever and for as long as he pleases. The eye radiates magic while Hazlik spies through it.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Eye of Hazlik taps into the Darklord&rsquo;s mastery of magic within his domain, helping to stabilize the wearer&rsquo;s magicâ€”at a price. Hazlik uses the eyes to keep tabs on magic-users in his domain, spying on those who might be useful or threatening to him. This surveillance enables him to reinforce his reputation as an ever-present, brilliant overlord.</p>

<p>When the inhabitants of I&rsquo;Cath fall asleep, they enter an alternate version of the city they call homeâ€”a city dreamed into being by the domain&rsquo;s Darklord. In time, these poor souls can&rsquo;t remember which version is the real I&rsquo;Cath and which one is the dream.</p>
<p>In the physical world, I&rsquo;Cath&rsquo;s surreal, knotted streets echo with their emptiness. Within spare, meandering row houses, the majority of the populace slump against walls or sprawl against each other where they fell. These people lie trapped within a collective dream world created by the city&rsquo;s ruler, Tsien Chiang. Within this shared dream they labor ceaselessly, ever striving to create the impossible, perfect city of a perfectionist mastermind.</p>
<p>Within the dreaming domain of I&rsquo;Cath, Darklord Tsien Chiang rules a golden vision of the cityâ€”a place of ultimate beauty and efficiency where all things move according to her design. For her, it is near perfection. For her people, it is a nightmare of inescapable drudgery from which death is the only escape. The dream city&rsquo;s identical, even streets sprawl across a broad hill, atop which rises a glorious palace Tsien Chiang shares with her four perfect daughters. Day or night, the streets are filled with people ever toiling to perfect the buildings, reshape the gardens, and undo the work of the previous days and weeks in favor of new designs. Within the dream, the people don&rsquo;t sleep, eat, or need to attend to any other concerns. They know only their work and the glory of Tsien Chiang.</p>
<p>In the waking world, the truth of I&rsquo;Cath is starkly apparent. Rows of decrepit, moldy homes merge to line endless, coiling avenues. The streets wind and double back, but eventually climb the rise at the city&rsquo;s center, where the infamous Palace of Bones and the gold-scaled Ping&rsquo;On Tower loom. By day, the streets are largely empty, except for those few desperate residents of I&rsquo;Cath who have yet to succumb to the domain&rsquo;s dream. They rush through their days, scavenging what they can in hopes of enduring the coming night.</p>
<p>Every twilight, Tsien Chiang climbs the spirit-infested Ping&rsquo;On Tower and tolls the Nightingale Bell. This renews the magic of her dream world and keeps her citizens asleep, but it also calls forth the legion of I&rsquo;Cath&rsquo;s undead ancestors whom she has bent to her will. Nightly these jiangshi (see chapter 5) emerge from their tombs and reshape the city&rsquo;s mazelike streets, striving to match Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s vision with merciless perfection. The Darklord&rsquo;s servants carefully move any sleepers they encounter out of the way of their work, but prey upon any waking souls who cross their paths.</p>
<p>Any whom the Mists carry to I&rsquo;Cath or who wake from Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s dream find themselves in a gray, haunted, ever-changing city where food is scarce and jiangshi hunt the living. With twilight comes a terrible choice: endure the uncertain terrors of the waking world or succumb to endless servitude in sleep.</p>

When players create characters from I&rsquo;Cath, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>How did you escape I&rsquo;Cath?</strong> Did you discover a secret way out of the city? Did a family member make a bargain with Tsien Chiang that gave you a chance at a better life? Did Tsien Chiang send you forth for a reason?</p>
<p><strong>Whom did you leave behind in I&rsquo;Cath?</strong> Why didn&rsquo;t they go with you? Did you try to forget about them? Do you plan to return to I&rsquo;Cath for them?</p>
<p><strong>How long were you awake?</strong> How did you evade or distract the jiangshi and the hungry ghosts? Did you find or lose something during your wandering? Do you bear a mark or scar from the experience?</p>

A dozen gleaming, gem-colored pavilions give the sprawling garden its name. Waking residents of I&rsquo;Cath yearn to visit the park to harvest its bountiful trees and pools, but they dare not, since the garden&rsquo;s thousands of shrines and memorials form a massive graveyard. The dead here don&rsquo;t lie quietly, as each marker names an ancient jiangshi. These jiangshi work Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s will throughout the city, but they return to seek vengeance if anyone intrudes in their garden.</p>

By night, the long-haired spirits of Ping&rsquo;On Tower wander the Mansions, searching for homes and families long ago destroyed in the city&rsquo;s renovations.</p>
<p>As characters explore the Mansions, consider how to represent the thousands of perpetually sleeping bodies inside. Do I&rsquo;Cath&rsquo;s residents lie where they fell? Did the city&rsquo;s jiangshi place them in orderly rows or stacks? Does the dream have a physical manifestation or toll? Do pale mushrooms or webs cover the sleepers?

Its walls and supports are built from the bones of those who died as a result of the Darklord&rsquo;s harsh governance over her homeland. Inside, the grimly beautiful palace displays its splendor with elaborate architecture and bone murals, while revealing its neglect with disrepair and emptiness. Only Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s library sees regular use. The Darklord spends her days here, drawing new plans for her city and analyzing mysterious forces and mystical fortunes in pursuit of the ultimate harmonious design.</p>

The topmost floor houses the Nightingale Bell, a broken bell forged from the scale of an ancient gold dragon. Stairs spiral up the structure&rsquo;s hollow interior, but the tower is far from unoccupied. By day, hundreds of spirits, hungry for the offerings and remembrances once provided by their lost families, mournfully drift through the tower.

The bell spreads the dream to dominate the sleep of I&rsquo;Cath&rsquo;s population, causing it to persist even when Tsien Chiang is awake.

<p>When Tsien Chiang was a child, her home was destroyed by a colonizing force, forcing her to flee into frozen mountains where she expected to die. Fortunately, a gold dragon took pity on her and gave her shelter. With nowhere else to go, Chiang promised to serve the dragon.</p>
<p>During the years that followed, Tsien Chiang attended the dragon, learning mysterious magic and medicine. In time, she became an accomplished wizard. Yet when she spoke of avenging her family and reclaiming her people&rsquo;s land, her dragon mentor chided her for holding onto her hatred and refused to teach her dangerous magic.</p>
<p>Eventually, Chiang could deny her revenge no longer. Among her mentor&rsquo;s records, she had learned of a bell that could make its ringer&rsquo;s dreams come trueâ€”but creating the bell required the scale of a gold dragon. Knowing her mentor would never provide a scale, Chiang drugged the dragon with a rare herb, planning to steal a small scale while he slept. But in her haste, she mixed the herbal concoction poorly. The dragon&rsquo;s body and everything nearby rapidly aged and decayed, killing her benefactor and destroying a hoard filled with ages of treasures and wisdom. Chiang&rsquo;s home had been destroyed again, but a single golden scale remained. Using the scale, Chiang constructed the Nightingale Bell and dragged it into her occupied city. Tolling it, she wished for a city devoid of invadersâ€”and instantly they vanished.</p>
<p>Awed and delighted, the nation executed the few invaders lingering outside the city and made Tsien Chiang their queen. Chiang ruled for years, enacting vast reforms and strict but sensible laws in pursuit of creating the perfect empire. She had a family, taking particular pride in her four beloved daughters.</p>
<p>As the memory of Chiang&rsquo;s past victories faded, her people grew frustrated with the queen&rsquo;s stern laws and demanding orders. Though her capital had become a radiant center of learning and art, the citizens revolted. Chiang acted swiftly to quell the uprising with numerous executions, yet the revolution grew. Everything she had wished for fell into flames. She showed no mercy to the rebels, ordering her armies to kill the families of all insurrectionists. In response, assassins struck Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s palace. Although she survived, her family did not.</p>
<p>Distraught, Chiang climbed to the highest tower of her palace, looked out over her burning dreams, and struck the Nightingale Bell. Rather than granting her vengeful wish, the bell cracked and spilled a golden mist across the land. When the mist cleared, Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s perfect city was gone, replaced by the unreal prison-city of I&rsquo;Cath.</p>

Soon after the city&rsquo;s rebirth, Chiang used the cracked bell to wish for her perfect city. Instead, her wish created a persistent dream world that occupies the dreams of all who sleep in I&rsquo;Cath. In this dream, Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s every plan is executed to perfection.

Suen then disseminates these orders to the jiangshi of the Gemstone Garden, who work through the night.

The bell created two sets of interpretations of her daughters. The set inside the dream city are perfect recreations of Chiang&rsquo;s lost daughters. Those in the waking city are monstrous interpretations of Chiang&rsquo;s memories, innocent but unnatural beings.

As a result, the domain&rsquo;s borders are always closed, as detailed in the &ldquo;The Mists&rdquo; section at the start of this chapter.

<ul>
<li>Chiang wishes to make the dream of I&rsquo;Cath a reality, and though her servants follow her plans perfectly, the city grows endlessly more disordered.</li>
<li>Chiang relishes the dream vision of I&rsquo;Cath, but it makes the reality of her city all the more unbearable. She won&rsquo;t let the corruption of her real city invade her dream, and aggressively stamps out any imperfection in the dream realm.</li>
<li>The loss of Chiang&rsquo;s daughters haunts her. She knows the idealized dream versions of her daughters are fictions, but she still spends as much time with them as possible. She avoids their eerie waking-world versions, whom she fails to love.</li>

<p>The reality of I&rsquo;Cath is an inescapable ghost city, overrun by jiangshi and ghosts. Escaping means engaging with those who know the city&rsquo;s secrets, whether sleeping residents, wandering ghosts, or deadly jiangshi.</p>
<p>The dream of I&rsquo;Cath presents a second layer to the prison city. The characters might find ways to move in and out of the dream. I&rsquo;Cath&rsquo;s people have no such recourse on their own, but if the characters wake individuals or disrupt the dream, they could allow those caught within to escape. (See &ldquo;The Dream of I&rsquo;Cath&rdquo; later in this domain for details.)</p>
<p>Darklord Tsien Chiang and her daughters dwell at the heart of both these worlds. Working with or undermining them provides paths to disrupting the Dream of I&rsquo;Cath and ultimately escaping. But Tsien Chiang holds great power over both her realms, and if she is convinced that either her city or her dream is beyond redemption, her edicts turn dire.</p>

But the forced smiles hide desperation from the watchful eyes of Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s stoic jiangshi ministers. The people undertake endless, repetitive tasksâ€”such as scrubbing the city&rsquo;s coinage or counting the seconds. Those who fail to keep up are reassigned to exhausting labor. Those who rebel are either dragged off to lightless cells or slain outright, forcing them to awaken in the real world.</p>

Only Tsien Chiang can use the Nightingale Bell to maintain the dream of I&rsquo;Cath. However, anyone can ring the bell to enter the dream bodily as though it were a demiplane. A creature that physically enters the dream leaves behind no body, and if killed, dies for real. The Nightingale Bell is protected by the Dark Powers and can&rsquo;t be destroyed.</p>

Characters with 1 or more levels of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> can try to wake up after every 6 hours they spend within the dream; to awaken, they must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail remain within the dream for another 6 hours, after which they can try to escape again. Creatures that do not sleep can choose to enter the dream by meditating. If they enter the dream, they are affected by it as if they were sleeping. Many residents of I&rsquo;Cath don&rsquo;t attempt to escape the dream, considering existence within it preferable to life in the real city.</p>

To her shock, each daughter reborn into the waking world took on an unnatural form. Although these young women mirror the personalities of Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s true daughters and their doubles in the dream version of I&rsquo;Cath, their forms and abilities are radically different. Chiang shuns them, but doesn&rsquo;t do them harm. Now these four strange beings wander I&rsquo;Cath, curious about the city and eager to please their mother. Every dusk they assemble at the Palace of Bones, hoping for kindness from Tsien Chiang as she hurriedly passes them to ascend Ping&rsquo;On Tower.</p>
<p>Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s daughters are generally good natured, but anxieties prevent the daughters from sleeping. If offered comfort and kindness so that the four sisters are all equally at ease, the daughters are able to fall asleep (see &ldquo;Disrupting the Dream&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s four daughters have the following names, forms, and simple dreams:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tsien Lei-An.</b> Voiceless Tsien Lei-An is made entirely of eyes and has the statistics of a scarecrow. She wishes for a robe of ghost hair silk or a jiangshi&rsquo;s slippers. She spends much of her time wandering the Mansions, rooting through the possessions of sleeping city-dwellers.</li>
<li><b>Tsien Man-Yi.</b> Made of pale wood, Tsien Man-Yi must remain near the willow tree in the courtyard of the Palace of Bones, and has the statistics of a dryad. She wishes for flowers from the Gemstone Garden or for a friend to fall asleep under her tree&rsquo;s boughs.</li>
<li><b>Tsien Seu-Mei.</b> Voiceless Tsien Seu-Mei is made entirely of teeth and has the statistics of a ghoul. She wishes to eat a delicious dessert or care for one of the fish of the Gemstone Gardens. She often wanders the stalls of Gwai-Huit Center.</li>
<li><b>Tsien Wai-Ching.</b> Made of living fog, Tsien Wai-Ching is the youngest daughter and has the statistics of a specter. She wishes to help a spirit from Ping&rsquo;On Tower find its family or to play with an incorporeal toy. She regularly explores the memorials in the Gemstone Gardens.</li>

Thousands of living people suddenly need to be fed, but they can reclaim their normal lives.</p>
<p>Those seeking to spoil Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s dream can do so in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dreaming Daughters.</b> If all four of Tsien Chiang&rsquo;s daughters in the waking world fall asleep, their sleeping forms replace their doubles in the dream city. This unites them with their mother in her perfect world, exactly as they&rsquo;ve always wanted. Tsien Chiang, however, is horrified by their intrusion and flees her dream.</li>
<li><b>Dreams of Revolution.</b> I&rsquo;Cath&rsquo;s dreamers and displaced ancestral spirits might be persuaded to revolt against Tsien Chiang. This leads to extreme responses from the Darklord and her servants, but could force her to neglect or end the dream.</li>
<li><b>Waking Dream.</b> A particularly compelling waking individual, spirit, or goal within I&rsquo;Cath distracts Tsien Chiang from her dream. Perhaps the spirits of her lost family haunt the Mansions, or an individual directs the jiangshi to perfectly execute the Darklord&rsquo;s plans. Either outcome might lead Tsien Chiang to focus on reality and let her dreams slip awayâ€”for a time.</li>

<p>For untold generations, the Vasavadan dynasty has ruled over the Great Kingdom of Kalakeri. This land was one of stability and prosperity until a barbarous civil war and a queen&rsquo;s dying curse brought low what centuries never could. Once an unrivaled power known throughout the world for its rare resources and vibrant trade, Kalakeri is now locked in an endless storm of violence. At the center of that storm stand the remnants of the Vasavadan: three heirs transformed into unspeakable monsters by their depravity and hatred.</p>
<p>Kalakeri is a deceptively beautiful land of verdant rain forests and an idyllic web of rivers and lakes known as the Backwaters. Rare creatures and extraordinary magical plants are found across the forest peninsula locals call the Harvest Peninsula. At the height of its prosperity, Kalakeri was a robust center of art, commerce, and religion, with foreign merchants spreading wild tales of Sri Raji, the Steaming Lands, the Land at the Heart of the World, and other fanciful names for Kalakeri. Now Kalakeri is a shadow of its past glory, a quagmire of intrigue and despair where fortunes change on a whim.</p>
<p>The people of Kalakeri live in dread, as a single misstep means doom. Schemers and hapless citizens alike are tossed by the tidal forces of the royal family. Following her betrayal and assassination, Maharani Ramya was restored to the world to avenge herself against her treacherous siblings, Arijani and Reeva. Ramya&rsquo;s curse manifests in both her deathless rage and in the monstrous forms afflicting her siblings. Both sides continue to escalate their atrocities against one another, drawing the powerful and the innocent alike into their squabbles. As Arijani and Reeva host murderous galas to entice fiendish allies, the forces of the Darklord search out and execute anyone they consider treasonous, adding their skulls to Ramya&rsquo;s ever-growing Tower of Traitors.</p>

They are typically dark-haired, dark-eyed, brown-skinned people with Indian- inspired names. When players create characters from Kalakeri, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>How has the war between the Vasavadans affected you?</strong> Residents of Jadurai live in the midst of conflict. Are you on Ramya&rsquo;s or Arijani and Reeva&rsquo;s side? Have you changed sides or tried to avoid the conflict entirely? If you haven&rsquo;t taken part directly in the conflict, has someone you care about been harmed by it?</p>
<p><strong>What part of society do you come from?</strong> Kalakeri is built on social class, with the nobility at the top, wealthy merchants and military officers next, and everyone else below. Where do you stand, and do you wish to rise or simply to survive?</p>
<p><strong>What are you hiding from the royal family?</strong> Does your family harbor a traitor, or do they avoid conscription into Ramya&rsquo;s army? Are you brave enough to pass on intelligence to a faction? Or do you work to overthrow both Vasavadan factions to end their strife?</p>

<ul>
<li>Two factions struggle to lay claim to Kalakeri&rsquo;s Sapphire Throne: the soldiers and loyalists of Maharani Ramya, and the nobles and merchants who support the younger royal siblings, Arijani and Reeva.</li>
<li>The vast city of Jadurai performs multiple duties as Kalakeri&rsquo;s capital, the site of the royal palace, and a battlefield where factions struggle to claim or hold it as a symbol of rule.</li>
<li>Fierce followers of each faction scour the land, murdering any who oppose their faction.</li>
<li>Refugees from the strife hide in the Backwaters, and rebel groups there organize against the entire Vasavadan family.</li>
<li>The Tower of Traitors is a dizzying, skull-studded structure that grows daily. Some say its completion will cleanse the nation of evil, while others believe it will summon the gods' wrath.</li>

<p>The colorfully canopied Lakshma Market trades in everything from betel leaves to the eggs of wyverns, which are common near the mountain spires known as the Lesser and Greater Vochalam.

<p>Jadurai retains its splendor, but the conflict between Ramya and her siblings takes an enormous toll. Sections of the city lie in ruins, and the slums encroach farther every day as misery and squalor consume Jadurai from the inside.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The Vasavadan dynasty has ruled over Kalakeri since ancient times. Ramya Vasavadan was hand-picked by her father to succeed him, but on the bleak day of the maharana&rsquo;s death, Ramya&rsquo;s brother, Arijani, declared himself the new maharana. Allied with ranas hungry for unearned power, Arijani tried to force Ramya to relinquish the Sapphire Throne.</p>
<p>Ramya refused to yield. Moving swiftly, she organized her allies, met her brother in battle, and captured him. She intended to execute Arijani, but her sister Reeva counseled her to be merciful. Ultimately, Ramya forgave the rebel faction, Arijani was imprisoned, and Ramya ascended as Kalakeri&rsquo;s maharani, Queen of Kings.</p>
<p>A golden period in Kalakeri&rsquo;s history followed as Ramya promoted learning and upheld justice. Meanwhile, Reeva secretly coordinated with Ramya&rsquo;s foes. After years of resentment and plotting, the rebels freed Arijani and spurred nobles across the nation into open revolt.</p>
<p>The resulting conflict swiftly turned vicious. Regretting her past mercy, Ramya captured enemy ranas and executed them using flame and ravenous tigers, while her loyalists put anyone suspected of treason to the sword. The maharani&rsquo;s brutality increased distrust in her rule, and the fighting spread.</p>
<p>After numerous battles, Reeva begged her sister to meet her brother and negotiate an end to the war. Ramya, who remained ignorant of Reeva&rsquo;s part in freeing Arijani, trusted her sisterâ€”and walked straight into their trap.</p>
<p>Ambushers slaughtered Ramya&rsquo;s royal guards and captured the maharani. In the central courtyard of the Cerulean Citadel, Arijani sentenced his sister to death. As the court strangler&rsquo;s garrote crushed her windpipe, Ramya cursed her brother and sister, calling them bloodthirsty beasts. Arijani and Reeva denied their sister the honors befitting a maharani, dumping Ramya&rsquo;s corpse into the sea. As they did, a terrible monsoon struck the Harvest Peninsula, bringing with it walls of supernatural mist that closed around Kalakeri.</p>
<p>The storm lashed Kalakeri for weeks, and when it reached its height, Ramya emerged from her watery grave. Reborn with terrifying power, she called upon those who had been slaughtered in her service. Loyal in death, a corpse legion joined the revitalized maharani. They stalked the streets of Jadurai, tore down the gates of the Cerulean Citadel, and slaughtered those who had betrayed Ramya. They dragged Arijani and Reeva into the courtyard where their sister died, and there Ramya declared them traitors. The treacherous pair clawed and howled like beasts as undead elephants crushed them to death. Their wails of terror left Ramya unmoved.</p>
<p>Arijani and Reeva&rsquo;s plots didn&rsquo;t end with their lives, however. They too were reborn, transformed into fiends with animalistic features by their souls' ravenous desires. And so the conflict gripping Kalakeri continues, trapping the nation in an endless war and forcing its people to swear loyalty to monsters.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ramya&rsquo;s treacherous siblings, Arijani and Reeva, endlessly contest her reign and sow discord across Kalakeri. Ramya both loathes and loves her siblings, so despite their perpetual deceptions, she remains vulnerable to their promises and lies.</li>
<li>Ramya can manipulate her domain and control its borders only while she controls the Sapphire Throne. If she is ousted and one of her siblings controls the Cerulean Citadel, doubt and despair weaken her influence over her domain until she retakes her seat of power.</li>
<li>An illusion masks Ramya&rsquo;s Undead state. Her true nature is revealed only by the chill of her skin and in her withered reflection. Ramya permits no mirrors in her presence, lest her curse be revealed.</li>

The common folk exert no control over the struggle for the Sapphire Throne and are forced to maintain the appearance of loyalty toward rival terrors.</p>
<p>Every part of Kalakeri holds secrets and dangers, and nowhere is untouched by its rulers' war for dominance. When planning adventures in Kalakeri, consider who currently controls the Sapphire Throneâ€”Ramya or Arijani and Reeva. Either faction is likely to notice the party and court them as potential allies. The characters then walk the fine line detailed in the &ldquo;Treachery in Kalakeri&rdquo; section later in this domain description.</p>
<p>The wilds of Kalakeri might also fuel terrifying adventures. The land holds all manner of perilous ruins and mysteries, from the secrets of lost rulers to the practices of forbidden magical sects. Without a steady, reliable presence on the throne, ancient cults, deadly beasts, and opportunistic demagogues are free to unleash dooms upon isolated villages. Your adventures might lead characters into Kalakeri&rsquo;s deepest wilds to rediscover lost secrets, save innocents, or curry favor with a faction.</p>
<p>Consider the plots on the Kalakeri Adventures table when planning adventures in this domain.</p>

Arijani and Reeva promise their followers wealth, freedom, and a chance for unprecedented social ascension, but in truth, their agendas are entirely self-serving, and they care for nothing but control. Whether or not the characters agree with these rebellious royals' agendas, they present the most significant opposition to Ramya&rsquo;s ruthless control of Kalakeriâ€”while defeating them is the swiftest route to gaining Ramya&rsquo;s favor.</p>

Like Ramya and Reeva, Arijani was given a second life by the Dark Powers. Now a rakshasa, Arijani uses his mastery of illusions and Reeva&rsquo;s insights to manipulate Ramya and his other foes. He&rsquo;s gregarious and enjoys the finer things in life, traits that ingratiate him with the wealthy and influential supporters he seeks to attract to his cause. These traits also allow him to cultivate a persona of vacant decadence, which he uses as a mask so his foes will underestimate him and reveal themselves. Arijani has faked his and Reeva&rsquo;s deaths on multiple occasions, after which they always return &ldquo;resurrected,&rdquo; leading Ramya to believe they can never be truly defeated.</p>

Unable to overtake Ramya in leadership skills, she sought more subtle methods. Her interests in intrigue and magic intensified when she discovered a hidden library beneath the Cerulean Citadelâ€”a repository of insidious magic hearkening back to the rule of certain tyrannical Vasavadan ancestors. Reeva uses what she discovered there to further Arijani&rsquo;s ambitions and yearns to gain control over the citadel so she can unearth its deepest, most insidious secrets.</p>
<p>After her murder, Reeva was reborn as an arcanaloth, a state that horrifies her. When frustrated, she vents her rage by instructing her servants to abduct someone she considers beautiful and then overseeing that beauty&rsquo;s destruction. Reeva is a cunning plotter, strategist, and manipulator. She applies these talents to her magic, entreating fiends for aid and using them to hasten the day when no one will underestimate her again. Many of Arijani&rsquo;s allies don&rsquo;t trust Reeva. Behind her back, they mockingly call her charismatic Arijani&rsquo;s opposite, or &ldquo;Inajira.&rdquo;</p>

Both Ramya&rsquo;s loyalists and Arijani and Reeva&rsquo;s rebels are fanatics, eager to report or act against those they consider traitors to the nation&rsquo;s rightful ruler or rulers. Meanwhile, the common folk in areas under a faction&rsquo;s clear control extol their loyalty to the local power loudly; in less stable areas, most keep their allegiance secret. While exploring the domain, characters regularly face questions about their loyaltyâ€”and in this conflict, neutrality is tantamount to betraying both sides. The characters' answers eventually earn them the attention of one side or the other, with members of that faction trying to dragoon them into the conflict.</p>

Those who support either of the domain&rsquo;s factions earn enemies and allies. Those who don&rsquo;t support a faction draw suspicion. Those who play the factions against one another might earn the favor of bothâ€”but for how long?</p>
<p>Using the renown system from the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide, track the characters' standing with Kalakeri&rsquo;s two factions. Every character begins with 0 renown score with each faction. Characters gain or lose points as they act against or in the service of either faction. As they do so, their standing with the factions changes, granting them access to favors or provoking reprisals. Characters adjust their renown score once per adventure, and rarely by more than 5 points.

Give the characters opportunities to meet, interact with, and rise in the esteem of Ramya, Arijani, and Reeva. As they do, highlight the monstrous nature of the three villains and that dealing with them involves hard choices. The renown system requires the characters to become active participants in the horrors of Kalakeri, encouraging them to ally with evil beings or make uncomfortable concessions to win greater victories later. Perhaps the characters betray Ramya in a way that evicts her from Jadurai for years, or cause one of Arijani and Reeva&rsquo;s political alliances to crumble. How far will they go for such opportunities?</p>

A faction mistrusts and actively opposes the suggestions of characters with a renown score ofâ€“1 or lower. Those with a renown score ofâ€“5 or lower are actively hunted by a faction&rsquo;s members and considered enemy agents.</p>

Characters might thus thread the needle of serving both groups. Relationships constantly shift in Kalakeri, and grudges rarely last long. As a result, the characters might walk the razor&rsquo;s edge of loyalty and betrayal in hopes of furthering their own goals.</p>

Characters who interact with the factions might change this balance. But if either faction firmly controls Kalakeri, the leaders enact their monstrous agendas upon the land, leading only to continued suffering. The Dark Powers ensure that the defeated faction doesn&rsquo;t remain quelled for long, though. The characters might instead try to gain influence with Ramya or with Arijani and Reeva to curb the villains' atrocities and mitigate the wickedness in Kalakeri. Such actions put the characters at risk, but if they don&rsquo;t intercede, who will?</p>

Using their influence among the ranas and merchants in the western part of Kalakeri, Arijani and Reeva have repeatedly driven Ramya out of the capital or into shocking defeats. When in control of the Cerulean Citadel, Arijani hosts decadent parties to spread his influence among Kalakeri&rsquo;s elite and those who further his interests. These events serve a secondary role in concealing private feasts featuring obscene delicacies and mortal flesh, allowing Arijani and Reeva to satisfy their fiendish hungers.</p>

<p>Kartakass is a vast stage that serenades the ambitious with promises of fame. Performance is a way of life in this forested domain, with everyone from the bards of Skald to the actors of Emherst pursuing dazzling dreams. Here, the people live by a simple rule: never let an audience grow bored.</p>
<p>To outsiders, life feels staged and surreal in Kartakass, as every plant and beast, every peasant and performer strives to prove their greatness. Trees and flowers burst into bloom and then wither after their extended spring, while songbirds sing themselves hoarse. And every local, from the youngest child to the most venerable elder, knows that dreams, fame, and immortal adulation are theirs for the takingâ€”if they prove worthy.</p>
<p>In Kartakass, individuals strive for glory. Where talent and expertise fail, obsession and duplicity reign, leading to repeating cycles of triumph, betrayal, and despair. Predators of all sorts flourish in this land of consuming passions and vicious secrets. With each full moon, the truth of Kartakass is exposed, and lycanthropes reveal their hunger for dominance and for blood.</p>

<p><strong>What artistic skill do you idealize or have a talent for?</strong> Is it a natural skill? Is it your family&rsquo;s preferred art form? Did you learn it from an idol or mentor?</p>
<p><strong>What do you use your talents, work, or travels to hide?</strong> Does insecurity or doubt drive you to excel? Did someone best you in your field of mastery? Does a vice, curse, or rumor color your reputation?</p>
<p><strong>What does success mean to you?</strong> Do you pursue wealth, fame, love, or acceptance? What extremes would you embrace to gain success?</p>

<ul>
<li>Kartakass has no unifying government. Instead, each settlement is governed by a meistersinger, who is acknowledged as the mayor and embodiment of local art. Meistersingers maintain creative rivalries with each other, largely for show.</li>
<li>Settlements pride themselves on performative traditions, such as distinctive dress or song stylings.</li>
<li>Wolves roam the land freely. Few venture outside during the full moon, fearing werewolves.</li>
<li>A sourceless song whispers through the mystical Wildersung Wood, always fading before it ends. Although no one knows its conclusion, all Kartakans know the beginning: &ldquo;Sing of the trees, give voice to the breeze, and stave off the bloom of doom. While the wise sing their song, guilty necks stretch long, and&mldr;&rdquo;</li>

The domain welcomes strangers. Small bands of merchants roam along the Lost Chord road or visit the quay at Point Hallucination in hopes of welcoming visitors and directing them to the domain&rsquo;s festively decorated communities.</p>

On the surface, Emherst is an elaborate, immersive stage. Every &ldquo;resident&rdquo; is an in-character actor, and most are younger than thirty, including those playing aged roles. These are students of the Emherst School of Living Theater located in the Understage, a network of caverns beneath the village. This underground &ldquo;backstage&rdquo; connects every structure in the village via tunnels and hosts elaborate elevators and special-effects devices. Incredibly devoted to their craft, the instructors, students, and support staff of Emherst continually improvise performances, taking seven weeks to prepare before performing uninterrupted through an eighth &ldquo;live&rdquo; week. As actors refuse to break character, outsiders find the performances changing around them to incorporate their interactions with the community. Ruthless competition for prime roles leads to tragedy, the appearance of tragedy, or individual breaks with reality.</p>

Entertainers pursuing the &ldquo;true&rdquo; music of Kartakass train and perform in the town&rsquo;s numerous venues, such as the Harmonic Hall school of music and the acoustically complex Amphitheater of Harmonia, which projects whispers in some areas and silences screams in others. Artists vie for opportunities to present their work at the supremely popular Crystal Club, a members-only venue inside a cave that features a stage constructed from a massive natural geode. The club is known for its dramatic decor and overly critical clientele, and it&rsquo;s widely rumored that performers who fail to impress at the exclusive club go into exile. The bloodier truth reflects the fact that the club&rsquo;s membership is restricted to lycanthropes. This echoes the secret of Harmonia: its vaunted traditions, such as night performances, fur-trimmed clothing, and grisly woodcuts, are inexorably intertwined with bestial curses.</p>

The community&rsquo;s residents are uniquely inured to apocalypse scenarios, since early morning sound blasts, wandering puppets, and lurid but heatless explosions regularly emanate from the studios of local dramatic effects artists and their apprentices. Magic and theatricality blur in Medria, leaving the locals numb to both wonder and danger.</p>

The lure of overnight celebrity, glowing marquees, and fawning crowds attracts the ambitious to Skald, aspiring to the fame of stars such as the renowned bard Akriel Lukas. Yet behind the facade of creativity and freethinking, business owners and aging celebrities prey on youth and creativity, while critics and struggling performers create a culture of desperate deceptions. Vice, criminality, dark bargains, and supernatural predators flourish in Skald, like a pack of wolves hiding behind glamorous masks.</p>

Wildlife lurks restlessly in the Wildersung Wood, stalking travelers with unusual boldness. And each day at twilight, a sourceless chorus drifts through the trees. The voices always sing the opening verses of the same song, but fade before it ends. Legends warn that any who hear the song should raise their voices and join the chorus. Those who don&rsquo;t risk meeting a terrible fateâ€”strangers or those who refuse to sing are regularly discovered with inexplicably broken necks.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Harkon Lukas&rsquo;s life companions are ambition and blood. Born amid a community of lycanthropes, he dreamed of commanding not just a pack, but a whole army, a nation, even an empire of born predators. Early in life, he sought to unite his reckless werebeast family and turn them into tools of his ambition. When they failed him, though, Harkon lashed out, ultimately driving the lycanthropes to turn on him. The would-be leader murdered dozens but barely escaped alive, fleeing into a nation of humans.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Harkon learned how to blend in with other peoples, how to manipulate those he considered his inferiors, and how to turn adoration into a weapon. He decided that if rule over a nation of hunters wasn&rsquo;t possible, he would force an empire of sheep to dance to the howling of wolves. Harkon Lukas became a legend, a performer, a teacher, a scoundrel, and a luminary. People flocked to bask in his remarkable presence.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, the land&rsquo;s rulers realized the threat Harkon posed. Officials tried to quietly imprison him for invented crimes, but the people defended him. When royal agents came for him en masse, the lycanthrope feigned his death. Outraged, the celebrity&rsquo;s followers rioted, and as the news spread, their outrage inspired a revolution. Within a week, the nation&rsquo;s government had crumbled, its defenders fleeing before an army that bore the red-stained coffin of Harkon Lukas at its head. As the rebel forces neared the walls of the royal palace, they were met by a contrite monarch, who gave a heartfelt speech, begging forgiveness and outlining concessions and a way for the nation to move forward. The rebels agreed to further negotiation.</p>
<p>At that moment, Harkon Lukas ended his ploy, bursting from his crimson coffin in wolf form and devouring the monarch before thousands of followers. Drenched in blood, the &ldquo;resurrected&rdquo; Harkon returned to his human form and donned a battered crown amid the roaring cheers of a nation of fans. But before the reign of the wolf could begin, the Mists rose amid the assembled throng and closed around their champion. When they cleared, the sovereign-wolf was no longer a step away from rule, but a stranger in an unfamiliar provincial land called Kartakass.</p>

He has statistics similar to a loup garou (see chapter 5) but is never forced to change shape, either by the moon or by other external factors. He prefers his human form, but explores different physical details as the mood strikes him. He&rsquo;s rarely seen without his signature wide-brimmed hat; wolf&rsquo;s tooth necklace; and violin, which he calls Bleeding Heart.</p>

He ever seeks to win esteem and influence among the domain&rsquo;s people, but the locals constantly forget he&rsquo;s a relevant modern performer. They remember his works fondly but vaguely, ever distracted by new novelties. In response, Harkon reinvents himself time and time again, striving to win the domain&rsquo;s love. To this end, he often exploits ambitious and naive new talent. He collects promising up-and-coming performers, becomes their mentor, traps them within the bond of lycanthropy, and then uses them as tools (see the &ldquo;Insatiable Hungers&rdquo; section later in this domain for details). Such alliances rarely last for more than a few months before Harkon grows bored and steals his protÃ©gÃ©s' performance ideas, their wealth, and their lives.</p>

Both children aren&rsquo;t lycanthropes and have complicated relations with their father, seeking to both earn his favor and surpass his greatest triumphs. Akriel idolizes Harkon and mimics his performing style to fuel her own career. As the Dark Powers don&rsquo;t torment her as they do Harkon, her reputation steadily growsâ€”much to her father&rsquo;s resentment. Casimir, on the other hand, wants nothing to do with Harkon and seeks to make his own way in life. Whether at the whims of his father or the Mists, though, he always finds his way back to Kartakass.</p>

Nightly, either Harkon Lukas (if he&rsquo;s in town) or new artists under his tutelage perform here. Any newcomer who performs on the Old Kartakan&rsquo;s stage is sure to become Skald&rsquo;s newest celebrity, with all the adulation, opportunity, and jealousy that inspires. Harkon keeps a private suite in the taverna. Those who come here seeking him must first talk their way past the taverna&rsquo;s heavily tattooed head bouncer and mixologist, the werewolf Haldrake Moonbaun.</p>

<ul>
<li>Harkon is obsessed with spreading his fame and travels Kartakass endlessly. Whenever he returns to a community, though, he finds he has been forgotten. Semi-polite variations of &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d retired&rdquo; ever torment him.</li>
<li>Harkon believes he just needs to find the right act, styling, or inspiration to finally cement him in the hearts of Kartakass&rsquo;s peopleâ€”and from there, take control of the nation.</li>
<li>Although Harkon is unable to build his own fame, he has a peerless eye for talent. His protÃ©gÃ©s swiftly attain stardom, and with it, Harkon&rsquo;s resentment.</li>
<li>Harkon&rsquo;s frustration eventually gives way to indulgences of his lycanthropic hungers. Bloody slaughters of his students and rivals often precede him moving on to another town.</li>

The domain&rsquo;s residents consider lycanthropes to be legendary threats, but in truth any resident who gives in to their vices might be consumed by the beast within. Numerous types of lycanthropes might flourish in Kartakass, or the curse of lycanthropy could spontaneously manifest in people who can&rsquo;t control their passions. Use or customize the lycanthropes in the Monster Manual to create cursed individuals transformed by desire and vice into bestial hybrids.</p>
<p>Kartakass also presents a fantastic domain in which to explore surreal twists on nature. The Dark Powers might give animals and plants friendly voices and welcoming aspects, but every being in the domain has an agenda. The cycle of life, as framed by predators and prey, takes on a grisly cast when a songbird&rsquo;s aria is cut short by lupine jaws.</p>
<p>Consider the plots on the Kartakass Adventures table when planning adventures in this domain.</p>

Depict the public&rsquo;s interest in the characters by using the renown system presented in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.Start the characters with high renown scores, but let their renown scores decay if they don&rsquo;t work to keep the public&rsquo;s interest. At the height of their fame, characters might be recognized by strangers on the streets, given free room and board, or invited to lavish social events. As their novelty fades, though, they&rsquo;ll find passersby snickering behind their backs and social circles closing to them. There are ways to alter the characters' social trajectory, though, such as embracing a relationship with Harkon Lukas.</p>

<p>Life is cheap in Lamordia. As far as the land&rsquo;s esteemed scholars are concerned, the spark that animates flesh is merely the result of chemical accidents and the proper formulas. Golems, homunculi, and other constructed beings groan to life to support a populace desperate to survive in this frigid realm.</p>
<p>Frozen bogs and glacial expanses surround Lamordia&rsquo;s smog- and machinery-filled cities. Unpredictable blizzards plague the long winters, and the chill summers last only a few weeks. Those who brave the wilds must contend with starving predators, from wolf packs and giant owls to isolated Humanoid clans struggling to subsist outside the domain&rsquo;s iron-walled cities. The cruel environment and populace threatened by starvation make Lamordia a crucible of desperate innovations. Claiming to work for the greater good, innovators and scholars push beyond the limits of morality. Their scalpels turn scientific pursuits into butchery, as their experiments reach beyond what is necessary for health to grasp after the secrets of existence. Flesh is Lamordia&rsquo;s most abundant natural resource, exploited for both desperate purposes and vain ambitions. And no ambitions have led to greater evils than the work of the domain&rsquo;s Darklord, Dr. Viktra Mordenheim.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lamordia is a frigid land of barren mountains, frozen swamps, and icy seas. Its ruler, Baron von Aubrecker, hasn&rsquo;t left his estate for years, though he issues proclamations and sends agents to collect taxes.</li>
<li>Steam power driven by boiling sewers fuels clockwork inventions and massive cranes in the city of Ludendorf. The necessity of such innovations in fending off starvation and the frigid environment encourages the scientists at Ludendorf University to push the boundaries of science and morality.</li>
<li>The reclusive genius Dr. Viktra Mordenheim created or inspired Ludendorf&rsquo;s greatest innovations.</li>
<li>Few voluntarily trek into Lamordia&rsquo;s wilderness, fearing freak blizzards, starving beasts, and creatures warped by strange radiation.</li>

Humans and gnomes are the domain&rsquo;s primary residents, with white hair and skin, often tinged blue or gray, being common. German conventions inspire many names in the region. When players create characters from Lamordia, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>Where and how were you raised in Lamordia?</strong> Were you a whaler, clerk, or factory owner in Ludendorf? Were you a miner, hunter, or prospector in Neufurchtenburg? Or if you lived outside these communities' walls, how did your family survive?</p>
<p><strong>What is your relationship with Ludendorf University</strong>? Were you educated there? Have you used tools created by its scientists? Were you hired to participate in a doctor&rsquo;s or student&rsquo;s experiments? Did you sell them the flesh rights to your body?</p>
<p><strong>How has the land scarred you?</strong> Have you suffered from frostbite in the wilderness? Do chemical or radiation burns scar your body? Did you sell a body part for coin? Did someone steal an organ from you while you slept?</p>

Boiling sewers and steam tunnels thread the city&rsquo;s foundations, heating cramped tenements and powering the cranes needed by the city&rsquo;s fleet. These ironclad, ice-breaking whaling vessels dare the Sea of Secrets to bring back massive beasts that provide vital food and fuel for the city.</p>
<p>Ensconced in the city&rsquo;s heart, Ludendorf University supports many local industries. Funded by corrupt entrepreneurs and wealthy but immoral benefactors, the university&rsquo;s vast curriculum boasts esoteric programs such as alchemical combustion, chemical sentience, and speculative anatomy. The sciences reign here, and students and faculty alike push to discover technologies that will net lucrative contracts from the city&rsquo;s wealthy overlords. The university continually needs new subjects for experiments and hires volunteers or pays individuals for &ldquo;flesh rights&rdquo;â€”ownership of their cadavers once they die. A secret society within Ludendorf University idolizes Dr. Mordenheim and follows the reckless paths laid by her lesser-known early works.</p>

Tapped-out mines provide shelter for the residents, while the iron-walled city hosts the smoking refineries necessary to process minerals harvested from the mountain range known as the Sleeping Beast. These rarified, little-understood elements are then shipped to Ludendorf&rsquo;s factories. Radiation-warped monsters and dangerous Humanoids from the nearby bogs roam the town&rsquo;s borders, mounting assaults to steal minerals and disrupt mining operations.

Those who have business with the baron are welcome for a brief stay, but they interact only with his perpetually smiling butler, Gerta.

The rest of the castle is home to her assistants and to servitor creations said to be generations beyond the inventions of Lamordia&rsquo;s other scientists. Dr. Mordenheim doesn&rsquo;t receive guests, but once a year she petitions Ludendorf University to send her its most promising student to serve as her new lab assistant.

A blanket of eerie calm hangs over its peaks, the result of high levels of radioactivity in the strange mineral deposits that vein the region. Warped beasts with lopsided anatomy, extra heads, and stranger qualities roam here, ambushing the desperate miners. The mountains' name stems from the legends originating with the bog-dwelling precursors of Lamordia&rsquo;s people who believed that the range was actually a single unfathomably large creature, and the veins of strange minerals were the beast&rsquo;s bones and blood. They punished anyone who harvested minerals from the Sleeping Beast, since doing so risked waking the beast and precipitating an apocalyptic disaster.</p>

She taught herself medicine as a child, and as a teen earned both a doctorate and an appointment as a preeminent researcher at a local university. Despite her genius, though, the young Dr. Mordenheim lacked empathy, compassion, and moral qualms. She pursued medicine solely to satiate her burning intellectual curiosity, never to aid her patients. She perceived magic as stealing the powers of otherworldly beings and cheating the laws of nature, and sought instead to use her mind to master the world.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Eventually, Dr. Mordenheim became convinced that she could do more than create lifeâ€”she could defeat death! She wished to breathe sentience into dead flesh and produce sturdier shells than the bodies of fragile, temporary mortals. She added corpse theft to her repertoire, employing thieves to procure specimens for her tests. This was how she met Elise, a beautiful but reckless body snatcher who was charmed by the doctor&rsquo;s aloofness and whose spontaneity entranced the methodical surgeon.</p>
<p>When Elise began showing signs of an incurable wasting disease, it was the first time either woman had felt the pangs of despair. In the months that followed, Dr. Mordenheim desperately hastened her experiments, employing anyone who would bring her bodiesâ€”both newly dead and still living. On her operating table, victims were killed, returned to life, and died again as Mordenheim sought to glimpse the secrets hidden in the instant of death.</p>
<p>One moonless night, Elise fell into a sleep from which she wouldn&rsquo;t wake. Bringing Elise to her lab, Dr. Mordenheim worked feverishly for days to save her, pouring what she&rsquo;d learned from a thousand deaths into saving one life. Elise became the recipient of the doctor&rsquo;s masterpiece, the end to disease and death: an artificial organ Mordenheim called the Unbreakable Heart. But as she stitched the miraculous device into place, constables burst into the lab and accused the doctor of facilitating numerous murders. As Dr. Mordenheim struggled against arrest, smoking chemicals and arcing electricity filled the laboratory. Before she lost consciousness, she saw Elise rise from the table, the Unbreakable Heart glowing within her behind golden stitches.</p>
<p>Dr. Mordenheim awoke in Lamordia, an unfamiliar land where her genius was celebrated. Elise and the Unbreakable Heart were nowhere to be found, but the doctor soon heard rumors of a glowing woman wandering in the icy wastes. Since then, Mordenheim has continued her experiments on the dead and living, striving to recreate her successes and failing every time. Between disappointments she searches the hinterlands, hoping to find Eliseâ€”and with her, the miracle of the Unbreakable Heart.</p>

At the end of the final day, the creature is complete and obeys her will. She uses this ability to create Flesh Golem and Homunculus, as well as Zombie, Death&rsquo;s Head, and Brain in a Jar (see chapter 5).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reborn Maker.</b> A side effect of Dr. Mordenheim&rsquo;s experiments is the creation of reborn (see chapter 1). It takes her <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> days and the dead bodies of two Medium or Small Humanoids to create one reborn.</li>
<li><b>Brain Swap.</b> Dr. Mordenheim can place a creature&rsquo;s brain or head into another body, moving it from a donor to a recipient. The process requires the donor to have a brain and either be <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> or to have been dead for less than 24 hours. In an operation that takes 1 hour, the doctor transfers the donor&rsquo;s brain or head from their body to the <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> or dead corporeal body of a creature without a brain. The donor awakes 1 hour later with control of the recipient&rsquo;s body.</li>
</ul>
<p>While controlling the recipient&rsquo;s body, the donor retains their alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. They otherwise use the recipient&rsquo;s body&rsquo;s statistics, but don&rsquo;t gain access to the recipient&rsquo;s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. Dr. Mordenheim can swap a donor&rsquo;s brain or head back from the recipient&rsquo;s body to their original body through this same process, as long as the original body exists and no more than 1 week has passed. This period can be extended if steps are taken to preserve the original body, such as by keeping it in cold storage or under the effect of a <wc-fetch type=spell>gentle repose</wc-fetch> spell.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mordenheim cannot remake the miracle of scientific immortality embodied by the Unbreakable Heart. She relentlessly tries to understand and repeat the circumstances of its creation, but fails every time.</li>
<li>Elise evades Mordenheim&rsquo;s attempts to find her.</li>
<li>The people of Lamordia view Mordenheim as a luminary and savior. She does not understand why and loathes the distractions they create.</li>

Her lack of empathy is immediately apparent to any who meet her. She views people as mere collections of neurons and meat, and she considers herself so superior that others' lives mean nothing to her.</p>

Here characters might become victims of Dr. Mordenheim&rsquo;s experiments or uncover terrible truths underlying the domain&rsquo;s strange science.</p>
<p>In the latter case, Lamordia&rsquo;s sinister steampunk veneer offers a perfect setting for a grotesque flavor of gothic horror, focusing on lives enslaved to machines, the worth of flesh, and the cult of scientific advancement at any cost. The harsh landscape feeds into this with both brutal cold and deadly creatures. Are the &ldquo;whales&rdquo; the mighty steamships of Ludendorf hunt for food and fuel truly whales, or perhaps dinosaurs, dragon turtles, or abominations created from people&rsquo;s flesh? At the other extreme, how do Lamordia&rsquo;s original inhabitantsâ€”the spirits of forgotten tribes, icy Fey spirits, or the Sleeping Beastâ€”feel about the land&rsquo;s exploitation?</p>
<p>The monsters that roam Lamordia are lab-crafted horrors or mutated beasts, but use the statistics of creatures from the Monster Manual. A monstrosity burned by radiation might use the stat block for a cyclops, while a scientist&rsquo;s winged flesh-blob assistant might use a homunculus&rsquo;s stat block.</p>
<p>Beyond these possibilities, consider the plots on the Lamordia Adventures table when planning adventures in this domain.</p>

A creature with the device inside them is immune to disease, ceases to age, and does not die of old age, though they can still die in other ways. The glowing device sheds light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. While inside a creature, the device causes the creature to shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>

They also risk becoming her newest experimental subjects.</p>
<p>Dr. Mordenheim&rsquo;s experiments provide an opportunity to put players in control of strange creatures or unique bodies. Either as part of an adventure or a longer campaign, the characters might awaken with their minds transplanted into terrifying new forms. Such a plot comes with both opportunities and pitfalls. On the one hand, waking up in Mordenheim&rsquo;s laboratory, either recently changed into reborn (see chapter 1) or about to undergo that process, could be an exciting way to start an adventure or whole campaign. On the other, players might not appreciate losing access to their characters or having their bodies held hostage to Dr. Mordenheim&rsquo;s plots. Before running an adventure where players lose control of their characters or decisions about those characters are made for them, ask the players if they&rsquo;re comfortable with such possibilities. It&rsquo;s better to tip your hand about the plot than to lose a player&rsquo;s investment in the game.</p>
<p>When delivering characters into the Darklord&rsquo;s clutches, employ scenarios where the party is actively involved, not merely abducted in their sleep. Consider using any of the following events that might lead to plots involving Dr. Mordenheim.</p>

<p>When death occurs in Mordent, it doesn&rsquo;t signal a passage to a state of rest, or an end to the struggle of mortal existence. Death here heralds the beginning of a haunted afterlife as a restless spirit. The dead earn no rest, no finality, no peaceâ€”just a passage into a shadow world of wispy phantoms, mournful groaning, and clanking chains.</p>
<p>At first glance, Mordent is a quiet domain of peaceful country estates that sprawl across rolling moors. Landowners of the aristocratic class maintain a pretense of being the benevolent custodians of the land and its hard-working farmers, fishers, and laborers. From the loftiest families to the lowliest workers, Mordent&rsquo;s people cling to traditions that define the order of society and each person&rsquo;s place in it. They do things &ldquo;the way they have always been done,&rdquo; because the old ways offer stability and security in an uncertain world.</p>
<p>Beneath that peaceful veneer lies a troubled society trapped in the ghostly grasp of its ancestors. The past can&rsquo;t be forgotten or left behind, because the spirits haunting the land embody that past. The social order can&rsquo;t change, because the restless dead enforce the old ways to maintain that order.</p>
<p>In Mordent, the dead who have unfinished business or a strong tie to a place or a family line manifest as all manner of spectral terrors. But not every unquiet spirit haunts the living. Isolated spirits wander the moors and ignore the living, or melt slowly into the Mists until at last they forget their identities. An unlucky few become trapped in the magical experiments of twisted scholars or bound to the service of the Darklord of the domain, Lord Wilfred Godefroy. And those with a personal connection to the Darklord are inevitably drawn to his manor on Gryphon Hill to become part of his endless torment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of Mordent&rsquo;s people live in quaint communities, the largest of which is the seaside town of Mordentshire.</li>
<li>The estates of wealthy families dot the Mordentish countryside. Most residents live private lives adhering to vague strictures of what is proper or polite.</li>
<li>The spirits of the dead don&rsquo;t rest quietly in Mordent. Each denizen of this realm can relate a story of a terrifying haunting that they or someone they know experienced personally.</li>
<li>The House on Gryphon Hill is the most famous haunted house in Mordent, known to be occupied by the spirit of Lord Wilfred Godefroyâ€”an evil man who murdered his wife and daughter.</li>
<li>The proximity of the spirit realm spurs local eccentrics to investigate spiritualism and the nature of the soul.</li>

Humans are the domain&rsquo;s primary residents. Locals have varied hair colors and a range of skin tones from black to pink, often with reddish undertones. Celtic and English conventions inspire many names in the region. When players create characters from Mordent, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>Who your family</strong>? Ancestry matters in Mordent. Are you from a landed family? Or were your parents tenant farmers, fishers, laborers, or in service to one of the noble estates?</p>
<p><strong>What are your family secrets?</strong> In Mordent, a secret shame, dismal curse, or gruesome haunt accompanies every family name. How much do you know about the skeletons in your family&rsquo;s closet? What guilt or misfortune do you carry with you?</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your experience with the supernatural?</strong> Have you encountered a ghost or spirit, or heard a firsthand account of a haunting from someone close to you? How did that experience affect you?</p>

These estatesâ€”including Gryphon Hill, Heather House, and Westcote Manorâ€”number among the most notable landmarks in the domain. The tenant farmers who work the land pay a portion of their crops to the landowners as rent. A small but relatively well-off middle class populates the handful of towns and villages scattered across the domain, most notably the town of Mordentshire.</p>

A cold wind blows in constantly from the sea, frequently escalating into howling storms. When the winds die down, they&rsquo;re replaced by a shroud of bone-chilling fog, which the locals call &ldquo;the breath of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mordentshire&rsquo;s businesses largely cater to local laborers, with a few remarkable exceptions. Saulbridge Sanitarium provides a refuge for the ill while also secretly hosting a cell of the Ulmist Inquisition (see &ldquo;Other Groups&rdquo; later in this chapter). There&rsquo;s also the herbalist shop of the scholar Rudolph van Richten. When van Richten is away, his shop is run by local mystery enthusiast Beatrice Polk or by twin sisters Gennifer and Laurie Weathermay-Foxgrove (see &ldquo;Travelers in the Mist&rdquo; for information on van Richten and the Weathermay-Foxgroves).</p>

The head of the family, Alice Weathermay, serves as mayor of Mordentshire and maintains her family&rsquo;s cliffside home, Heather House. The manor has known joy and tragedy, and reflects both in its ivy-shrouded stone and sharp gables. Within, the house is a museum of family trophies and heirlooms, including a grand rosewood harpsichord and the wheelchair of Lord Byron Weathermay, the house&rsquo;s architect, who ensured that clever lifts made his home fully accessible. At the edge of Heather House&rsquo;s grounds is the Weathermay Mausoleum, the resting place of generations of Weathermaysâ€”and the location of a secret magical laboratory guarded by the quasit Tintantilus.</p>

Recently, a circle of druids gathered in the nearby village of Glaston to plan a rite using the lakes to create a magical passage to similarly shaped sites in other lands. The fate of the druids is unknown, but the region is now haunted by a terrifying variety of ghostly animals that delight in hunting the living.</p>

<p>Lord Wilfred Godefroy was an unremarkable minor aristocrat who inherited the estate of Gryphon Hill near Mordentshire centuries ago, after murdering his father. An angry and abusive man throughout his life, he also murdered his wife, Estelle, and young daughter, Penelope, in a fit of rage. The two rose that night as mournful phantoms and haunted him with their wailing and condemnation. Every night for the next year, the spirits appeared and tormented him, until in desperation he took his life on the anniversary of their murder.</p>
<p>But Lord Godefroy&rsquo;s suicide didn&rsquo;t stop his torment. His spirit lingered in Gryphon Hill, and the ghosts of his wife and daughter haunted him day and night. Moreover, the spirit of his murdered father soon appeared to join the chorus of condemnation. Lord Godefroy possessed an adventurer and attempted to use the living body to put his family&rsquo;s spirits to restâ€”but the adventurer died, and then <em>his</em> ghost began to haunt Godefroy as well.</p>
<p>In desperation, Lord Godefroy sought out a different kind of help in the world of the living. He began haunting an alchemist named Rastinon, urging him to pursue research into mortal souls. Rastinon crafted a terrible artifact he called the Apparatus, which could separate the soul from a living body, translocate souls from one body to another, and otherwise manipulate the substance and energy of spirits both living and undead. Lord Godefroy hoped the Apparatus would send all spirits (including him) to their deserved rests, but the artifact had the opposite effect: its necromantic energy washed through the region around Mordentshire, killing every living being in it. As the Mists rose, Lord Godefroy became lord over a land of ghosts, haunted by the spirits whose deaths he had caused. Now, all living souls that dwell in Mordent are doomed to haunt the domain&rsquo;s Darklord long after the demise of their mortal bodies.</p>

These spectral dead can be magically returned to life as normal, but those who aren&rsquo;t restored to life linger as Undead until they&rsquo;re destroyed or the Mists claim them. Spectral agents of Lord Godefroy remain alert for useful souls that might be enlisted into the Darklord&rsquo;s service.</p>

Hundreds of spirits are bound to the house and the surrounding grounds, and all serve the lord of the house and struggle to keep in his good graces. Those spirits who rebel are punished, either forced to face Godefroy&rsquo;s kennel of spectral hounds or dragged to the deepest recesses of the house, which even the eldest spirits fear. Any spirits capable of possessing the living are permitted to do so only when Lord Godefroy commands it. The Darklord rarely allows the dead to experience life like this, and when he does, it&rsquo;s to possess those who can work his will elsewhere in the domain or to expand the eclectic structure that is the House on Gryphon Hill.</p>

Godefroy&rsquo;s servants have spent centuries abducting magical geniuses, possessing them and convincing them to recreate the Apparatus again and again, often with unpredictable or catastrophic results. The magical device has caused all manner of inexplicable teleportations, mergings of living beings, duplications of souls, and strange manipulations of the Mists. At any time, Godefroy&rsquo;s servants are working to perfect the Apparatus somewhere in Mordent.</p>

His most useful contact in learning news and keeping tabs on the living is Alice Weathermay, mayor of Mordentshire. Godefroy manipulates her to pass on information and do his bidding by holding the spirit of her dead husband, Daniel Foxgrove, hostage.</p>

Everything in the domain that&rsquo;s outdoors is heavily obscured by the fog (see the Player&rsquo;s Handbook). Characters who reach the domain&rsquo;s borders through this fog are affected as detailed in &ldquo;The Mists&rdquo; at the start of this chapter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Godefroy is concerned only with his own misery; the suffering of the other spirits in Mordent merely fuels his torment.</li>
<li>Exceptionally arrogant, Godefroy brooks no opinions or criticisms from his inferiors, and blames every failure on his spirit servants.</li>
<li>Godefroy&rsquo;s family still haunts the House on Gryphon Hill. Although he wishes for their love, he avoids the floor of the house where they dwell, resenting their rightful condemnation.</li>
<li>Godefroy is convinced the Apparatus is the key to escaping his undead existence. However, he can&rsquo;t grasp even its basic workings and is frustrated by every delay and malfunction related to the device.</li>

The adventure pulled back the Mists on the domain of Mordent, a realm of terrors beyond Barovia, and introduced such characters as Lord Byron Weathermay, the mesmerist Germain d&rsquo;Honaire, the tragic Godefroy family, the lycanthropic Timothys, and Azalin the lichâ€”names you&rsquo;ll find throughout this book. With the <em>House on Gryphon Hill</em>, Barovia and Mordent paved the way for Ravenloft to become a vast and varied setting encompassing dozens of Domains of Dread.</p>

In tone and trappings, the domain resembles the countrysides of Gothic literature: lands dotted with haunted manor houses, stalked by packs of ghost hounds, and troubled by the spirits of dead warlocks that cause trees to rot from the inside out.</p>
<p>Any kind of ghost story adventure (as described in chapter 2) fits in Mordent. This domain is particularly appropriate for stories that deal with the lingering influence of the past, the oppressive weight of tradition, and the ongoing effects of generational curses. The restless spirits enforce an archaic and repressive social order where everyone knows their place, and those who step out of line are punishedâ€”sometimes gruesomely.</p>
<p>Consider the plots on the Mordent Adventures table when planning adventures in this domain.</p>

The &ldquo;Ghost Stories&rdquo; section of chapter 2 provides a good starting point for detailing elements of a ghost story. This section supplements that material with advice specific to building an adventure reminiscent of a classic ghost story, focusing on three key elements of such tales: history, tragedy, and romance. Throughout this section, consider the word <em>ghost</em> synonymous with any sort of spirit or incorporeal Undead.</p>
<h4 id=history>

This gives any ghost story characteristics similar to a mystery. Be generous in planting clues to the ghost&rsquo;s history throughout the adventure, assuming that the players will miss several of them.

That often involves completing whatever business a ghost left unfinished, resolving the ghost&rsquo;s attachment to something or someone in the living world, or finding a way to destroy the ghost so they can&rsquo;t return, which is usually a matter of exploiting their attachment to people or a location.</p>

<p>Like a pendulum, Richemulot swings perpetually between hope and despair. Some days, the sun rises over Pont-a-Museau as if it were an ordinary city, and not one in which many of the buildings stand empty and abandoned. On those days, people move freely through the open gates, and the silent, heavily armored guards of the Casques Silencieux watch over calm promenades and markets. But a day or a week or a month later, the first telltale cough cracks amid the crowd. As people evacuate the streets and lock their doors, rats crawl from the sewers in tremendous numbers. Shortly thereafter, the gates slam shut. No doctors come, and no information arrives; the populace is left to die.</p>
<p>The Gnawing Plague stalks Richemulot, arriving without warning. It comes with the rats, but it doesn&rsquo;t leave with them. For weeks or months at a time, life becomes an interminable wait as people peer out from between slatted windows and wonder how long the plague will last this time. Inevitably, frustration and fear beget superstition and violence.</p>
<p>Eventually the gates open, signaling that the city is safe again. How the Casques Silencieux know is a mystery, but their judgment always proves correct. And so the cycle goes, from ruin to relief and back again, with de facto ruler Mademoiselle Jacqueline Renier ever above it all, tirelessly working to pull her realm back from the brink of total collapse.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Gnawing Plague, or simply &ldquo;the Gnaws,&rdquo; is a deadly, recurring ailment that afflicts Richemulot.</li>
<li>Richemulot&rsquo;s royal family died of the plague. Mademoiselle Jacqueline Renier, the nation&rsquo;s most prestigious aristocrat, rules as temporary warden.</li>
<li>When the plague swells to epidemic proportions, the state police, the Casques Silencieux, enacts martial law and quarantines whole cities.</li>
<li>The government organizes no food or medical aid for quarantined communities, leaving residents to contend as best they can.</li>
<li>Richemulot&rsquo;s cities contain an inexplicably large number of buildings, an amount greater than their highest populations would have ever warranted.</li>
<li>Rat swarms prowl city streets like packs of dogs.</li>

The domain is predominantly populated by humans and halflings with dark hair colors and various rich skin tones, many of whom bear the marks of childhood diseases or medical treatments. When players create characters from Richemulot, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>How do you avoid the Gnawing Plague</strong>? The Gnawing Plague visits Richemulot regularly. When the plague comes and the cities face quarantines, how do you stay safe? Do you keep a stockpile of food and other supplies for the inevitable lockdowns? Do you rob your neighbors or rely on their kindness?</p>
<p><strong>Are you a survivor of the Gnawing Plague</strong>? Did someone tend to you while you were sick? Did you undergo a remarkable treatment? What scars or painful memories do you have from the experience?</p>
<p><strong>How did the Gnawing Plague change your destiny</strong>? Did your chances for education, travel, or apprenticeship vanish? Were you a noble who lost all they had? Were you banished from your community when you got sick?</p>

The city&rsquo;s abundant space could easily house twenty thousand souls, but although it&rsquo;s Richemulot&rsquo;s most populous city, fewer than half that number live here. Still, Pont-a-Museau&rsquo;s casual sophistication hints at a cosmopolitan past. Indeed, the sprawling, foreign architecture gives rise to one of Richemulot&rsquo;s most widespread folk talesâ€”that the people living here now aren&rsquo;t the land&rsquo;s first inhabitants.</p>
<p>The citizens of Pont-a-Museau share their city with rats. These vermin are a ubiquitous presence, and visitors become accustomed to the flash of sudden movement at the periphery of their vision. Some say they are Jacqueline Renier&rsquo;s spies. This rumor might contain truth, as many who whisper it vanish in the night and are never seen again.</p>

From here, Jacqueline Renier rules Richemulot. She holds audience from her parlors and public courtrooms, but her private residence is sacrosanct, and few outside her family ever visit it.</p>
<p>Unknown to all but the Renier family and their staunchest allies, Chateau Delanuit stands above the inscrutable Inverted Court, a downward-spilling palace that connects to the vast sewer system of Pont-a-Museau and beyond. This is the epicenter of Richemulot&rsquo;s polity, the clandestine home of its wererat families, and the true capital of the domain.</p>

<p>This was not always so. When Jacqueline Renier first ascended to the throne and imposed her law upon the land, the people of Saint Ronges resisted her rule. Renier granted the city its freedom, absent the support and infrastructure of the state. To this day that remains the case, though the dwindling People&rsquo;s Council of Saint Ronges has long since learned its lesson. The council has repeatedly petitioned Mademoiselle Renier for mercy. For now, she is still considering.</p>

The town resembles an extended tenement, with new construction built atop old and hastily thrown together shanties lining the inside of its walls.</p>
<p>Mortigny is quickly quarantined during surges of plague, but anyone is allowed to enter the city so long as they do so with the understanding that they can&rsquo;t leave. Small communities across the domain send their sick to Mortigny, both to be rid of them and because the city has Richemulot&rsquo;s largest concentration of medical practitioners. The best of these healers work at Mortigny West Clinic under Doctor Simone Temator. Doctors across the city fight tirelessly to aid the sick and research new treatments for the Gnaws, but ultimately their work does little to curb the disease. Many desperate practitioners have turned to unconventional methods to halt the plague&rsquo;s spread.</p>

</span></p>
<p>A century ago, Richemulot was a lively place. In those days, not a building stood vacant as merchants from both ends of the Musarde set up shop along the broad boulevards of Pont-a-Museau. As wealth trickled into the merchants' coffers, those of low birth began to taste the benefits of nobility.</p>
<p>Renier saw how the city was changing and tried to convince her family of the danger it posed. The burgeoning middle class sapped her family&rsquo;s authority, transforming them from lords over the commoners into mere landlords. But Renier&rsquo;s family surrendered to the times. Her grandfather grew infirm over the years and less able to look out for the family&rsquo;s interests, and the othersâ€”even her twin sister, Louiseâ€”seemed oblivious to the threat. It fell to Jacqueline to correct their failings.</p>
<p>Finding like-minded souls took Renier years, but she finally became aware of the mysterious Trueblood Council, a secret society of Richemulot&rsquo;s eldest and most esteemed families. Expending a fortune, Renier aggressively pursued membership. Finally she was granted an invitation to join the society&rsquo;s members at their meeting place hidden among the sewers of Pont-a-Museau. But when Renier arrived, she found a throng of filthy commoners, not the dramatic masterminds she&rsquo;d expected. As she cursed them and set off to fetch the guards, the council members revealed their true wererat forms. That night, she was inducted into their ranks.</p>
<p>Renier swiftly accepted her new life as a wererat and her status as a member of Richemulot&rsquo;s first inhabitants. Her spite toward the lowborn turned instead toward non-wererats. Her first major act consisted of conferring the gift of lycanthropy upon her family. Only her twin, Louise, resisted, for which Jacqueline disfigured her and cast her out.</p>
<p>Next, she bent her wererat allies to her vicious pursuit of control, unifying the country&rsquo;s verminous hordes. Within the sewers of Pont-a-Museau, the wererats concocted a roiling pestilence incubated in the filth of the bourgeoisie. Disease was not unknown in Richemulot, but the virulence of this new Gnawing Plague sent panic through the populace. The disease killed indiscriminately, wiping out the nation&rsquo;s royal dynasty and leaving power vacuums filled and then quickly emptied by ailing nobles. Only the Reniers proved immune, and eventually Jacqueline stood as the highest-born noble in the land, and the nation&rsquo;s de facto leader.</p>
<p>The people begged Renier for help. Disgusted by the masses, she deemed them unworthy merely for the circumstance of their birth and the scarcity of coins in their pockets, Renier let them die. As the last human soul expired in Pont-a-Museau, the Mists rose, drawing Richemulot into the Domains of Dread.</p>

Rather than the soldiers they appear to be, these troops are animated armor filled with rats that mindlessly and mercilessly enact Jacqueline Renier&rsquo;s will.

However, when Richemulot was claimed by the Mists, its populace consisted mostly of commoners once more. Rather than ruling a land dominated by her wererat peers, Renier now endures various torments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renier has no taste for ruling, yet feels obligated to keep up appearances to maintain her power. Her decrees are rash and self-serving.</li>
<li>Renier&rsquo;s schemes killed most of the finer aspects of Richemulot&rsquo;s society. She endlessly craves the decadence she once took for granted.</li>
<li>The people talk of establishing a new government when the threat of the plague passes. Renier and her wererat allies must constantly create new strains of the plague to maintain power.</li>

Proper rule by the Reniers benefits all, and she is obviously the greatest of the Reniers. On some level, she knows that her certainty is born of unchecked privilege and vanity.

The characters might even be able to handle maladies when they afflict one or two members of the party, but their magical resources are quickly expended in the face of relentless contagion that&rsquo;s intentionally spread. The &ldquo;Cycle of the Plague&rdquo; section later in this domain explores how to use an ongoing disease as a backdrop to your adventures, while the Richemulot Adventures table suggests other plots that might unfold in the domain.</p>

<h4 id=progressing-stages>
<a href=#progressing-stages class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Progressing Stages</h4><p>The plague&rsquo;s progress begins at stage one, advances to stage four, and then either wanes back to stage one or ends when everyone in a community is dead. Each stage can last for days or weeks, as appropriate for your adventures.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you&rsquo;d like to have the plague play out more randomly, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> each day. If you roll 2 or lower, the stage decreases by one. If you roll a 17 or higher, the stage increases by one. If the characters spend at least 1 hour during the day working to treat the sick, the stage decreases by one if you roll a 4 or lower.</p>
<p>Let the plague&rsquo;s cycle proceed for as long as your adventures demand, waxing or waning whenever it&rsquo;s most dramatic. The plague will never kill everyone in Richemulot; there will always be miraculous cures or reasons for Jacqueline Renier to withdraw her infected rat swarms. The cities then repopulate swiftly, with new residents emerging from the Mists to little notice. This ensures that after a period of relative peace, the plague&rsquo;s next wave is just as devastating as the last.</p>

Neighbors shun one another. Everyone hears the gnawing sounds in the dark, but no one searches out the source. During this stage, whenever a character goes out in public, roll or choose an encounter from the Stage Four Encounters table. If exposed to the Gnawing Plague, a character must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to resist the disease with the DC listed in the table entry for that encounter.</p>

<p>All is well in Tepest. Fields shine with the golden hues of a bountiful harvest, and horned village children happily recite sing-song rhymes. But those who linger among this land&rsquo;s pastures and colorful cottages can&rsquo;t escape the feeling of being watched, or the impression that the idyllic fields have a distinctly somber cast. The locals dismiss such worries as the tricks of scheming fey, but their smiles fail to mask the desperation in their eyes.</p>
<p>Brutality wears a welcoming face in Tepestâ€”a truth embodied by the ancient hag Lorinda, who betrayed her coven in pursuit of a daughter to love. Taking the guise of a deity called Mother, Lorinda has adopted the entire village of Viktal, protecting its people from nature&rsquo;s whims so they can feed her accursed offspring. Meanwhile, lingering in forests and hiding beneath the earth, resentful fey watch and plot, offering cruel bargains to those who wander beyond Mother&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p>The people of Viktal, Tepest&rsquo;s only remaining community, do what they must to survive, using tradition and faith to cloak their fear of the wilds and their complicity in a cycle of murder. Strangers are symbols of hope to themâ€”either as a promise of a life free from terror, or as potential sacrifices for the next necessary slaughter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Viktal is the only noteworthy community in Tepest. The idyllic village&rsquo;s residents devoutly follow the optimistic, naturalistic faith of the god known as Mother. Supposedly, no one born there ever wants to leave.</li>
<li>The frequent festivals in Viktal include a fertility celebration called the Tithe, which occurs once each season.</li>
<li>The most zealous of Viktal&rsquo;s faithful are Mother&rsquo;s Minders. These devotees sacrifice their left eyes to Mother to show their faith.</li>
<li>Caves dot the land, connecting to deeper caverns where dangerous fey dwell. The people of Viktal fear the fey and blame them for every accident and ill.</li>
<li>Few children are born in Tepest. Determined would-be parents must bargain with Mother or the fey to bring them a child.</li>

Humans and hexbloods (see chapter 1) of any appearance are common, but other folk with ties to the fey might also hail from the domain. When players create characters from Tepest, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love about Tepest?</strong> Is it the peaceful life or the bounty of nature? Is it your family or the colorful festivals? Feel free to invent customs and rural celebrations that hold significance for you.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about Mother?</strong> Do you devotedly follow the deity? Did you sacrifice an eye to her to become one of Mother&rsquo;s Minders? Are you a hexblood that she created? Or do you follow your village&rsquo;s customs out of expectation or fear?</p>
<p><strong>Who have you lost to the Tithe?</strong> A parent or sibling? A friend or partner? Do you understand the necessity of the loss, or do you want revenge?</p>

Rocky soil and unpredictable weather make much of the region ill-suited to agriculture, and deadly predators, murderous goblins, and cunning fey haunt the wilds. Despite this, the land around the community of Viktal is a haven of peace and bounty. Most people in the domain live here, though scattered homesteaders and hermits take their chances in the wilds.</p>

Today, Mother ensures peace in Viktal. Wicker scarecrows guard the rich fields, and friendly people go about their business with idyllic simplicity. Families in the community share their crops and resources equally. The cheery villagers welcome visitors, showing eager interest in their stories and lodging them free of charge at the village inn, the Fisher&rsquo;s Rest. Visitors are welcome to stay for as long as they like, especially as one of the seasonal Tithe festivals approaches.</p>

The Gurgyl, a structure of thorns, wicker, and giants' bones, appears as a misshapen, towerlike nest balanced on three skeletal dragon legs. Lorinda and her daughter Laoirse dwell inside this mobile fortress, which holds Lorinda&rsquo;s kitchen-laboratory, Laoirse&rsquo;s nursery-oubliette, and the Old Cauldron, a plugged pot where Lorinda&rsquo;s coven-sisters languish. The Gurgyl ranges across Tepest at Lorinda&rsquo;s will and might appear anywhere. The villagers of Viktal know the Gurgyl serves their god in some way, but sighting it portends bad luck.</p>

By day, its woods throng with fat, happy animals. By night, the ground turns to mud and brambles from which the transformed victims of deadly magic rise. A sanctuary from the terrible night beckons on the shore of Lake Lenoreâ€”the sturdy walls and warm hearth of the Nobody&rsquo;s Inn. The fey and their servants avoid the inn and its skeletal innkeeper, Bryonna, at all costs.</p>

The fey create their homes in a realm of glowing crystals and mist-filled fissures. Dozens of different species live here, under the seelie Queen Maeve and the unseelie Prince Loht. These siblings jointly rule their hidden realm together despite a strained relationship.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Arak resent the people of the surface for ancient slights and view them as dangerous. They avoid the folk of Viktal but eagerly play malicious tricks on those who venture into the wilderness. The fey could easily overwhelm the surface dwellers, but Maeve and Loht hold them at bay to avoid the hag Lorinda&rsquo;s ire. The fey monarchs believe Lorinda&rsquo;s followers possess a weapon capable of unleashing a deadly force and that it is locked beneath the three-peaked mountain called Gwydion&rsquo;s Claw.</p>

<p>Lorinda, Laveeda, and Leticia, the Mindefisk sisters, were gifts from the faeries to their lonely mother, a kind, honest woman who wanted daughters to cherish. Their brutish father and brothers resented the girls, whose sufferings grew worse after their mother died. Desiring a better life, the sisters began preying upon travelers who passed by their secluded home. They murdered wealthy strangers, stole their valuables, and disposed of the bodies in their family&rsquo;s stewpot. The sisters' wickedness was revealed and when they squabbled over a stranger they all fancied and ultimately murdered the traveler. When the rest of the family discovered their terrible deeds, the sisters killed their father and brothers. As their murder spree unfolded, the Mists rose. When they cleared, unfamiliar mountains in a land called Tepest surrounded the sisters' simple valley home, and their true nature as vicious hags manifested.</p>
<p>From the strange fey of Tepest, the three hags learned magic that they used to prey upon the humans of the nearby valleys. Over generations, they became known as fickle sages and weavers of dooms and miracles. Strangers sought them out, begging for bountiful crops, potent medicines, or the children that fate denied them. The hags sowed blessings and despair in equal measure. Numerous hexblood children originated from the hags' cauldron. In time, the hag Lorinda asked her sisters to help create a child of their own. But Laveeda and Leticia refused, loathing the idea of sharing their magic and secrets.</p>
<p>In secret, Lorinda assembled a creature of animal parts, brambles, and foul magic. With its help, she ambushed her sisters and trapped them inside their own magic cauldron. Soon after, Lorinda&rsquo;s creation fell apart, and she has used magic stolen from her imprisoned sisters ever since to create flawed, hungry beings she calls children (see &ldquo;Lorinda&rsquo;s Children&rdquo; below).

In her true form, she carries her darling familyâ€”three grim dolls she calls Laveeda, Leticia, and Laoirse. When dealing with the residents of Viktal, she takes on her benevolent illusory guise as Mother.</p>

In this illusory form, she appears as a matronly figure wearing a cloak of moth wings and bearing a branch burning with torches. Using her control of the land as Tepest&rsquo;s Darklord, Mother brings bounty to fields and flocks, or curses farms with famine and aberrant livestock. Those in her service rarely produce offspring and so petition her for hexblood children (see chapter 1). All Mother asks of her followers in return for her blessing is that they love her best, remain watchful for those of weak faith, and offer seasonal sacrifices (see &ldquo;Viktal and the Tithe&rdquo;).</p>

The most devout, called Mother&rsquo;s Minders, each undertake a ritual in which they pluck out their left eye, gifting its sight to Mother. Lorinda can see through her followers' empty eye sockets as though they were hag eyes (detailed in the Monster Manual). Additionally, she can teleport at will from the Gurgyl to an unoccupied space adjacent to any Mother&rsquo;s Minder. On the rare times she does, she appears to physically crawl out of her follower&rsquo;s empty eye socket.</p>

Lorinda can use her sisters' prison to cast any of the spells shared by a hag coven (detailed in the Monster Manual). If the cauldron is unsealed, Laveeda and Leticia seek swift revenge against their sister.</p>

She loves these monstrous beings, naming them all Laoirse and treating them as if they were the same individual. These creatures rarely live for more than a few weeksâ€”except when a villager is sacrificed to Mother during the Tithe, which extends Laoirse&rsquo;s life by a few weeks. Lorinda dotes on her children, rarely letting them leave the Gurgyl, and wreaking horrible vengeance on any who harm them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lorinda desires to have a family, but her inherently controlling, murderous nature leads her to destroy whatever she creates.</li>
<li>She constantly doubts the adoration she receives from her daughters and worshipers. Lorinda requires constant proof of their love.</li>
<li>Lorinda can create hexblood children for others, but any being she fashions for herself is monstrous, ravenous, and short-lived.</li>
<li>Lorinda fears that her sisters will one day escape their captivity and take revenge on her.</li>

She&rsquo;s quick to dote on others, calling them unsettling pet names like &ldquo;lostling,&rdquo; &ldquo;caterpillar,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sweetskin.&rdquo; She insists that others call her some variation of &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; Lorinda relishes the worship of Viktal&rsquo;s people but treats them as livestock, guarding them fiercely only to slaughter them as she wills. In her Mother guise, she maintains an air of benevolence, claiming to ask for little despite her followers' supposed sloth and ingratitude. She will do anything to prevent the villagers from learning her true nature.</p>

Here, dread lies in contrasts. Tree branches grasp like claws while every cottage exudes a warm glow. Smiles come readily but last too long. Wildflowers grow from the carcasses of mutated lambs.</p>
<p>The Mists deposit visitors to Tepest near Viktal, whose folk encourage strangers to partake of the village&rsquo;s hospitality. Will characters accept a welcome respite, or will they be suspicious of their hosts? Do they ask about Mother? If they discover the horror of the Tithe, do the characters view the villagers as victims or monsters? The following section, &ldquo;Viktal and the Tithe,&rdquo; explores how to draw characters into the village&rsquo;s eerie traditions.</p>
<p>Beyond Viktal, the inescapable hostility of the natural world holds sway. Harsh weather casts a pall over the land, and predators and dangerous plant creatures haunt the forests. Any kind of Fey creature might dwell in the domainâ€”or beneath it in the realms of Arak. Even whimsical fey take on a malicious tinge in Tepest, whether as thieves, kidnappers, deal-makers, or collectors of eerie trophies. Like the land itself, the fey have strange powers, and villagers pushed to desperation seek them out in the hopes of bargaining for what fate has denied them.</p>
<p>When planning adventures in this domain, consider the plots on the Tepest Adventures table.</p>

There, they find welcoming people, warm food and beds, and an unsettling sense that the daily life and traditions of the villagers conceal horrible secrets. What starts as glimpses of strange behaviors or rustic decorations culminates in learning the village&rsquo;s secrets firsthand during the seasonal Tithe. This section explores the village of Viktal and provides guidance on how the Tithe unfolds.</p>

Farms and fishing shacks cluster around the village, shying away from the shadows of the surrounding woods and mountains. Those who visit Viktal soon meet Mother&rsquo;s faithful, who appear at first to practice a local, naturalistic faith. But as the characters explore, they notice especially pious villagers with missing eyes called Mother&rsquo;s Minders and other locals engaging in unsettling behavior.</p>
<p>The villagers are curious about strangers, and eventually someone invites the outsiders to the Fisher&rsquo;s Rest for a free meal and to share their stories. The villagers encourage new arrivals to become part of the community, since that&rsquo;s what Mother teaches them to doâ€”and to broaden the pool of sacrifice fodder for the next Tithe.</p>
<p>When the characters visit Viktal, roll or choose options from the Sights in Viktal table to set the tone of the village&rsquo;s strangeness.</p>

During this day-long celebration, Mother&rsquo;s followers revel in the bounty of nature and new life. The villagers spend weeks in preparation for the celebration, and villagers eagerly explain that the Tithe is a commemoration of nature&rsquo;s abundance during which a measure of the town&rsquo;s bounty is returned to Mother. In truth, the a festival is meant to prepare one of the villagers for slaughter at the hands of Lorinda&rsquo;s child, the latest Laoirse.</p>

Then, near midnight, the celebrants move farther into the fields to receive Mother&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>At midnight, amid ceremony and solemnity, Mother appears to her worshipers. Mother&rsquo;s Favorite is instructed to carry a bowl of food and gifts to Mother. As they do, the latest Laoirseâ€”viewed by the villagers as a manifestation of nature&rsquo;s hungerâ€”appears and attacks. All assembled expect Laoirse to slaughter the victim, spilling their blood and bringing fertility to the fields for another seasonâ€”and gaining an extra few weeks of life before inevitably decaying like all Mother&rsquo;s prior children. As Laoirse drags away her meal, Mother blesses her faithful and vanishes. The villagers merrily return to their homes, having completed the Tithe for another season.</p>
<p>The particulars of how this ritual plays out are up to you, but it always culminates in Laoirse&rsquo;s attack. Whether a character is chosen as Mother&rsquo;s Favorite or the party tries to defend the victim, roll or choose an option from the Lorinda&rsquo;s Daughter table to determine what horror arrives at the ritual&rsquo;s climax. Creatures on the table marked with an asterisk are detailed in chapter 5.</p>

<p>In the jungles of Valachan, survivors must guard their hearts lest something monstrous eat them. For some, that risk is worth the reward of the unusual plants and magical creatures this land is home to. But Valachan is fiercely protected by its Darklord, the devious and immortal hunter Chakuna. She roams the jungles hunting dangerous beastsâ€”and when she grows dissatisfied with simpler prey, she draws sapient quarry into a fatal contest.</p>
<p>Pitted against other conscripted players in a game of cat and mouse, Chakuna&rsquo;s prey struggle to survive the deadly Valachan rain forest and one another, all while being pursued by the Darklord. Treacherous quicksand and other deadly hazards cover the terrain, and populations of stealthy werepanthers support the Darklord. But desperate contenders might also find unlikely allies who oppose Chakuna and her horrific hunts.</p>
<p>Valachan has villages but contains no cities or towns, since the forest doesn&rsquo;t allow them to be built. Every shivering leaf and every creature&rsquo;s eyes hold an eerie awareness. The forests watch, and they whisper what they see to Chakuna.</p>
<p>A mystery that ties the Darklord to her domain could shatter her power or plunge the land into utter catastrophe. The secret pulses in the breath of the forest, timed to the heartbeat of its master. Those who survive long enough in Valachan to discover its secrets might end up twisted into the predator they oppose.</p>

<ul>
<li>Valachan is a land of dense rain forests, sandy shores, and forest-covered mountains. This wilderness is fantastically dangerous, but the people who dwell here have long flourished.</li>
<li>Valachan hosts the Trial of Hearts, a battle royale conducted during certain full moons by the land&rsquo;s greatest hunter, Chakuna.</li>
<li>Any wild plant or creature in the jungles of Valachan might turn hostile toward explorers.</li>
<li>Packs of displacer beasts roam the jungle, led by Yana, a preternaturally cunning displacer beast that serves Chakuna.</li>

The domain&rsquo;s people are predominantly humans with dark hair and a range of warm, brown skin tones. Some names take inspiration from Mesoamerican languages. When players create characters from Valachan, consider asking them the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>How did you avoid or survive participating in the Trial of Hearts</strong>? Did you flee Valachan to evade the hunt? Did you somehow escape Chakuna after being selected? Did you volunteer to protect somebody else?</p>
<p><strong>Why aren&rsquo;t you a werepanther?</strong> Are you from one of the outlying villages, like Shuaran? Were you adopted? Were you born without the gift, or do you display a different manifestation?</p>
<p><strong>What secret of the land do you know better than anyone else?</strong> Is it the existence of the grotto filled with healing flowers? The secret way out of a box canyon? How to get a giant parrot to like you?</p>

Rumors of this land&rsquo;s rare abundance often escape the domain, enticing traders, herbalists, beast tamers, and seekers of magical reagents to search it out. But visitors must tread lightly and take their plunder sparingly, or the wrath of the Darklord will surely find them.</p>
<p>Valachan has no established roads, but well-traveled game trails snake through the dense forest, marked out by generations of inhabitants. These paths are easily spotted by those who know how to look for them.</p>
<p>Every living thing in Valachan generates wily camouflage, venom, spines, tricks, or traps. Nothing here is safe, defenseless, or as it seems.</p>

Opposed to the rule of Chakuna, the Shuaran fear her deeply and might aid those who resist her, defining their relationships with strangers through a prickly, easily offended sense of honor. The Shuaran constantly guard against a local shrewdness of howling apes to the south near Yakum Beach. A soft and menacing whooping in the distance can be heard in the village at all times.</p>

Within this canyon lies a small, crumbling temple nestled among treacherous cliffs and grasping forest. In the blood-painted caverns hidden beneath the temple lies a stone altar bearing the still-beating heart of Darklord Chakuna. Here, an aspiring Darklord can perform a ritual to consume Chakuna&rsquo;s heart and take her place as ruler of Valachan, or destroy it and loose the sapient rage of the rain forest on anyone trapped within the domain&rsquo;s borders. Only Chakuna, the displacer beast Yana, and von Kharkov&rsquo;s remains know the location of Chakuna&rsquo;s heart and how to claim her power.</p>

For Chakuna, caught in a cycle of bloodshed and trapped by the forest that lends her power, the tools of the oppressor became the means of her bitter domination.</p>
<p>The Darklord Urik von Kharkov ruled from the now-ruined Castle Pantara, a fortress of tyranny and torment from which he hunted the people of Valachan for sport. Over untold years, the hunt grew in complexity, and von Kharkov sought out the rarest, most dangerous prey. Chakuna&rsquo;s people, the Oselo, became his favorite targets.</p>
<p>The Oselo are hunters and people of the jungle. But by the light of the moon, many grow fur, claws, and fangs, revealing their true nature as watchful and dangerous lycanthropes. By the time Chakuna was a teenager, von Kharkov had fine-tuned the horror of his hunts into a regulated tournament. He hunted her people to the brink of extinction, preventing their escape by closing the domain&rsquo;s borders and trapping them within the Mists.</p>
<p>Chakuna swore to save her people. She entered the tournament freely, determined to turn the tables on von Kharkov or die. She vowed to sacrifice whatever it took to defeat the Darklordâ€”but learned quickly that it takes monstrosity to beat a monster. Chakuna found von Kharkov&rsquo;s weakness, burned Castle Pantara to the ground, and kept the former Darklord&rsquo;s head.</p>

In so doing, though, she discovered a terrible truth about the nature of Valachan, and she now lives to maintain the domain and the cycle of predator and prey. Chakuna has statistics similar to a weretiger, but her animal and hybrid forms have the appearance of a panther.</p>

At the height of her contest with von Kharkov, she ripped it out of her chest with her fingers and placed it at the center of the Yaguara Mountain maze, then replaced it by taking and eating von Kharkov&rsquo;s heart. Doing so, she co-opted von Kharkov&rsquo;s powers and accursed immortality and claimed Valachan as her own. Within Yaguara&rsquo;s Heart, the sacred nexus of the maze, Chakuna&rsquo;s heart still beats as one with the land, infinitely connected and as robust as the rain forest. But like anything that lives, her tie with the domain she&rsquo;s claimed must be maintained. Life eats life. And so Chakuna sacrifices the blood of the hunted to the land to maintain her grip on power. If she doesn&rsquo;t, the plants and animals of the domain grow hostile, threatening to wipe out all who dwell there.</p>

She must endlessly steep the land in blood to ensure her survival and protect her people from the vicious land, so that the hunts she vowed to stop now continue in her name. She shields her people from the slaughter, but the rest of Valachan is fair game.</p>

Other terrors in the Domains of Dread take the form of vicious villains or terrifying monsters. But in Valachan, the land is the greatest threat, and the domain&rsquo;s murderous Darklord hones that threat like a weapon.</p>
<p>The Trial of Hearts anchors the terror in Valachan, but the domain&rsquo;s dangerous wilderness threatens anyone who explores the land. In addition to natural rain-forest predators, dinosaurs and Displacer Beast roam the domain. Its varied Plant creatures include wicked Twig Blight, cruel Treant, and manipulative Dryad all expressing the land&rsquo;s underlying blood thirst. The people of the landâ€”the werepanthers of Oselo, the Shuaran, and remote groups of lizardfolkâ€”might provide assistance to outsiders, but they don&rsquo;t tolerate those who insult their ways or bring Chakuna&rsquo;s wrath upon them. Parties without experience exploring dangerous wilds can enlist a guide to aid them, a service that the Oselo are particularly willing to provide.</p>
<p>Valachan provides the opportunity to exaggerate everything the players and characters know about the threats of nature. The <wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch> skill proves invaluable in navigating the rain forest, determining what kind of creature mauled a corpse, and understanding how different venoms afflict a jungle survivor. The primal power of the land manifests as environmental hazards such as sudden storms, cliff walls made of vertical quicksand, and naturally occurring pit and snare traps. Whispering hollows, carnivorous plants, and cursing winds can overtly reveal the wilderness&rsquo;s hunger.</p>
<p>Consider the plots on the Valachan Adventures table when planning adventures in this domain.</p>

Scenarios like the following might lead to the characters becoming involved in the trial:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Unwitting Criminals.</b> The characters come to Valachan seeking a miraculous plant, rare creature, or unique itemâ€”and are captured when they discover their prize is sacred to the domain&rsquo;s people. To redeem themselves, outsiders must participate in the Trial of Hearts.</li>
<li><b>Deadly Detour.</b> While traveling elsewhere, the party is shipwrecked or ambushed by a deadly predator. The characters awake in Valachan, where Chakuna treats them as trespassers.</li>
<li><b>Mindtaker Mists.</b> The Mists deposit the consciousnesses of each of the characters into guests at Pantara Lodge. Whether the guests are recreational hunters, unsuspecting foreign nobles, or skilled local warriors, they soon discover that Chakuna&rsquo;s hospitality has a deadly ulterior motive. Consult the &ldquo;Survivors&rdquo; section of chapter 4 for options to represent those destined to become prey.</li>

She leads the participants to Pantara Lodge, shows them every courtesy, and then sets out the rules of her test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contenders may divide into small groups or choose to participate alone.</li>
<li>Once groups are established at the trial&rsquo;s start, alliances between contenders are not permitted.</li>
<li>Contenders must reach one of two shrines: either on Kiru Island or between the lakes called the Scars atop Anquara Plateau.</li>
<li>Contenders may leave Pantara Lodge at dawn the next day. Later that day, at dusk, Chakuna pursues the contenders with hunting partners of her choice, attempting to slay anyone she encounters outside a shrine.</li>
<li>Contenders may kill one another for any reasonâ€”particularly to take a shrine.</li>
<li>The trial does not stop for any reason until Chakuna arrives at both shrines and acknowledges the winners there.</li>
<li>Winners are escorted to Shuaran, and from there, out of Valachan.</li>
<li>Losers rot where they fall in the jungle.</li>
<li>Violations of the rules are punishable by death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chakuna closes her domain&rsquo;s borders while the trial is underway and can change the hunt&rsquo;s rules on a whim. For example, if she catches a competitor too soon, she might offer to release them if they sacrifice an arm to feed her beasts.</p>

Maps of Valachan can be obtained from the Oselo, the Shuaran people, or from Chakuna.</p>
<p>The domain&rsquo;s jungles are difficult terrain, reducing a party&rsquo;s pace by half. This means characters can move through most of the domain at a normal pace of 11/2 miles per hour and 12 miles per day. Characters can move at a fast or slow pace, with effects as detailed in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook.</p>
<p>Characters able to fly find their flight slowed by strong winds (effectively difficult terrain), and might face deadly airborne creatures such as Chimera, Harpy, and Pteranodon. Chakuna might also add rules to the Trial of Hearts that deem flight and magical travel off limits. If she does, the Mists aid in enforcing these rules.</p>
<p>As Darklord of Valachan, Chakuna isn&rsquo;t impeded by difficult terrain in the domain&rsquo;s wilderness. Instead of tracking how Chakuna follows characters participating in the hunt, have her appear to watch and toy with other participants, then confront the characters at the most dramatic moment.</p>

Those who choose Kiru Island as their goal must cross treacherous waters to reach it, while those who head for the Scars must climb the towering Anquara Plateau. Additionally, each hour the characters travel through the domain, roll on the Valachan Hunt Complications table for an encounter. Characters traveling at a fast pace roll twice on this table and use the lower result. Characters traveling at a slow pace roll twice on the table and use the higher result.</p>
<h4 id=completing-the-trial>
<a href=#completing-the-trial class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Completing the Trial</h4><p>At both Kiru Island and the Scars, a shrine on stilts offers the only safety during the Trial of Hearts. When Chakuna arrives at a shrine, whoever she finds inside wins the trialâ€”or so she claims. Whether Chakuna abides by the rules of her trial is up to you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, escaping Chakuna requires finding her heart and destroying it. This prevents Chakuna from recovering if slain. If the characters learn the secret of how Chakuna consumed von Kharkov&rsquo;s heart and took his place as Darklord, any of them might seek to follow a similar path. Doing so requires replacing Chakuna&rsquo;s heart with a character&rsquo;s own heart, or the land utterly rebels and tries to kill all sapient beings in the domain. Those who take Chakuna&rsquo;s mantle can ensure their allies' safety, but Valachan becomes their eternal prison.</p>

Countless domains drift through the Mists. The following lands hint at the multitudes of additional domains that make up the Domains of Dread. Detail and explore these domains in your adventures as you please, or use them as examples when creating your own domains using the guidance in chapter 2. Not all domains need to be elaborately detailed settings. As the domains in this section demonstrate, creating a simple concept for a Darklord and the horrors surrounding them can be a perfect starting point for further development over the course of your adventures.</p>
<p>While exploring the Domains of Dread, should the Mists carry characters to a mysterious domain, roll on the Domains of Ravenloft table to randomly determine where the Dark Powers have guided the party. Domains marked with an asterisk are described earlier in this chapter.</p>

<p>The disaster known as the Mourning numbers among the greatest tragedies to befall the world of Eberronâ€”a mysterious calamity that killed nearly everyone in the land of Cyre. In the nation&rsquo;s capital of Metrol, some citizens foresaw the coming devastation and sought to escape upon lightning rails, elemental-powered engines capable of pulling trains of passenger carriages. As scared innocents packed Metrol&rsquo;s last lightning rail, known as Cyre 1313, the evacuation was delayed at the demand of a late-arriving VIP. Hundreds were forced from passenger carriages to admit and maintain the secrecy of this last passenger and their retinue. When the lightning rail did finally depart, it was too late. The disaster of the Mourning overtook the train and its hundreds of escapees. But even as it did, the Mists claimed Cyre 1313 and all aboard it. Now, the last lightning rail from Metrol hurtles through the Mists as a traveling domain. Those on board fear the disaster pursuing them, the mysterious passenger seated in the train&rsquo;s foremost carriage, and the necrotic energy now infusing the engine&rsquo;s elemental spirit. Yet none of the passengers realize their endless escape is pointless, as Cyre 1313 carries only the dead.</p>

<p>Tristen ApBlanc was born amid tragedy, the son of a vampire father and a human noble. His parents were murdered by fearful villagers, leaving Tristen to be adopted by local druids. But during his teenage years, Tristen&rsquo;s dhampir nature revealed itself (see chapter 1). When the druids discovered the youth&rsquo;s hunger for blood, they cast him out, but Tristen grew enraged and slaughtered the druids, draining them all. The sacred waters of the druids' rituals had infused their blood, though, making it poison to the half-vampire. Tristen died with his adopted family, but as the Mists closed in around their sacred stone circle, he rose a ghost. Unexpectedly, with the dawn, Tristen&rsquo;s dhampir body was restored. Now, Tristen lives by day, a perpetually young, charming, invention-obsessed dhampir dwelling in Castle Tristenoira, the smoking fortress his goblin servants built over the druid circle of his one-time family. At night, though, the young dhampir dies a painful death, in his spectral form, and seeks to scour all that is green and vibrant from his land.</p>

<p>A notorious hedonist, Marquis Stezen D&rsquo;Polarno was popular among his noble peers but craved immortality. A mysterious artist offered him eternity by painting D&rsquo;Polarno&rsquo;s portrait upon a magical canvas. But the artist didn&rsquo;t mention that the painting would strip D&rsquo;Polarno of his love of life and natural charm. The marquis has discovered a reprieve from his now-dulled existence, howeverâ€”once every season, when he shows the painting to an audience, it consumes their souls and refreshes his thrill for life. D&rsquo;Polarno&rsquo;s artistic predations captured the attention of the Dark Powers, which drew his lands into the Mists. Now, Ghastria is a fertile island that, like its lord, lacks an essential vim except for once a season when vigor fleetingly returns.</p>

<p>Born of a Barovian family, Yagno Petrovna went missing upon the slopes of Mount Ghakis as a youth. As a violent storm rose, he took shelter in a mysterious ruin and was found wandering the hills weeks later, babbling about an amber idol and the god he&rsquo;d discovered, Zhakata the Provider and the Devourer. His family sought to help him, but when they discovered Yagno secretly sacrificing people to his fictitious god, they chased him into the Mists. When Yagno emerged, the domain of G&rsquo;henna sprawled before him.</p>
<p>Life is hard in G&rsquo;henna, a rocky land home to fierce, starving animals. The domain&rsquo;s people worship the bestial god Zhakata and regularly travel to the cathedral-city of Zhukar. There, they offer their crops in sacrifice and hear Zhakata&rsquo;s will through the words of revered prophet Yagno Petrovna.</p>

<p>Gabrielle Aderre is convinced that her son, Malocchio, is destined for greatness. From her estate outside the village of Karina, she employs an endless string of servants to provide Malocchio the best possible upbringing. Inevitably, though, every servant flees or vanishes, either as a result of Gabrielle&rsquo;s unreasonable expectations or the deadly tricks and accidents that frequently occur around the child. Gabrielle isn&rsquo;t content to leave her son&rsquo;s grand destiny to chance, though. Using her precious bone spirit board, she calls upon supernatural forces to guide and protect her son. Spirits, angels, fiends, and worse answer her summons, but as long as they chart Malocchio&rsquo;s path to glory, Gabrielle eagerly accepts their gifts.</p>

<p>Klorr is the end of worlds. Here, shattered islands drift through a misty netherworld, caught in a swirling spiral that ends at the unignorable, burning eye called Klorr. Thirteen stars orbit this sun-like sphere, one winking out every hour. Each time one of the stars dies, one of the domain&rsquo;s ruined islands is drawn into Klorr and consumed by flames. With it, each other island wrenches ahead, then halts, one hour closer to the same doom.</p>
<p>Those who dwell upon the crumbling land masses trapped in the domain constantly count the hours until their end. Few know how they came to Klorr or when new islands are added to the cycle, only that the Mists closed in and doomed them. Amid the realm&rsquo;s surreal skies float the ruins of lost and failed domainsâ€”among them, a tower like a blackened rose and a city of skullsâ€”as well as timeless echoes of domains that yet exist. Those cast away amid this orderly apocalypse grow ever more desperate to defy the doomsday clock and the will of a hidden Darklord, the obsessed clockmaker named Klorr.</p>

<p>Any who sleep might close their eyes and become forever trapped in the Nightmare Lands, a phantasmagoric realm whose features shift endlessly. Those who visit and escape speak of malicious wildernesses; the empty city called Nod; and uncountable drifting spheres, each containing a stranger&rsquo;s unending nightmare. Insidious entities called the Nightmare Court rule the domain. None know how many members compose the court, but they include the tragically graceful Ghost Dancer, the tomb-bound Hypnos, the witch Mullonga, the trickster Morpheus, and the embodiment of terror known as the Nightmare Man. These beings are artisans of nightmares, visiting terrors upon any whose sleeping minds brush against the domain.</p>
<p>The Nightmare Court&rsquo;s members share one commonality: all are the living nightmares of Caroline Dinwiddy, a potent psychic who repressed memories of her own heartless deeds. These memories torment her sleeping mind, creating the Nightmare Court.

<p>An island chain that once belonged to the domain of Kalakeri, the Ashram of Niranjan was a vibrant <em>vihara</em>, or monastery, for ascetic scholars who practiced Ramsana, a way of life whose central tenet advises nonattachment to the material world. Now only a small, reclusive group of these scholars remains, led by the elderly <em>sadhu</em> (holy figure) Niranjan. In truth, Niranjan is Sarthak, a wicked bronze dragon who send agents into the Mists bearing his philosophical writings. These works promise escape and peace to any who adopt their teachings and search the Mists for their source. Anyone who comes to the ashram must divest themselves of worldly goods, which are added to Sarthak&rsquo;s hidden hoard. The false sadhu then helps his victim enter a blissful trance that causes their soul to slip away from their body over the course of days. Sarthak consumes this soul and replaces it with a shadow, leaving the victim&rsquo;s body under his control.</p>

<p>An unparalleled warrior, Myar Hiregaard united the nomadic tribes of the vast plains of Nova Vaasa. But, while respected as a soldier, Myar made a poor peacetime leader. When brutal games could no longer keep her interest, she incited hostilities between two of her vassal tribes, then led her own forces to crush them. Subtly, she did this again and again. After Myar&rsquo;s greatest massacre, the Mists enfolded all of Nova Vaasa, splitting Myar&rsquo;s personality in two when they did. Now she rules her people with strict fairness, but when her bloodlust is piqued, she transforms into the raging knight called Malkan and sows discord across the plains.</p>

<p>The toymaker Guiseppe had his wish for a family granted when his creation, the marionette Figlio, came to life. A proud father, the toymaker presented his son to all the other people of his village, Odaire. The local children loved Figlio, but their parents were skeptical, saying the marionette was nothing but a toy. Over time, this doubt enraged Figlio, and the marionette convinced Guiseppe to craft siblings for him. Then, when the time was right, Guiseppe&rsquo;s creations did away with all the adults in Odaire. Claimed by the Mists, Odaire is a village populated only by children and ruled by the carrionette Figlio, who now calls himself Maligno. (See chapter 5 for details on Carrionette.)</p>

<p>Nearly every domain knows some version of the apparition called the Headless Rider. It appears as a mercenary in dark armor in Mordent, a ghostly cataphract in Har&rsquo;Akir, and a mutated centaur in Lamordia, but in each incarnation certain details remain true: the rider is missing its head, it appears upon a prominent bridge, and it decapitates victims as it endlessly searches for its own head. Should someone escape an encounter with the Headless Rider, they might find a different domain on the opposite side of the spirit&rsquo;s bridge.

<p>The Risibilos is a small music hall, similar to those found in any decent-sized city. Its lord, Doerdon, was once a kingâ€”one so thoroughly humorless that he forbade his subjects the privilege of laughter, upon pain of death. He is now cursed to entertain others, a task he is utterly unqualified for.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Mists delivered him a partner, a ventriloquist&rsquo;s dummy carved in the likeness of Strahd von Zarovich. The eerie dummy has a mind of its own, insisting that it is the real Strahd and that the creature currently sitting upon the throne of Castle Ravenloft is a mere impostor. It rages at the audience and makes audacious promises to any who will help it regain its station. This is hilarious to anyone with the slightest inkling of who Strahd is, and their peals of laughter are agony to Doerdon&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>Lemont Sediam Juste fancied himself a serious playwright, and he achieved popular, if not critical, acclaim throughout Dementlieu for his works of grisly horror. But he craved respectability, and with his new play <em>Apparitions</em>, Lemont believed he would find it. The night of the premiere, when the audience signaled their boredom, the playwright was crestfallen. His supporters wanted blood, so he gave them what they craved. By the play&rsquo;s end, Lemont had joined the play and viscerally murdered every member of the cast while the crowd roared their approval. As the show ended, the playhouse broke from Dementlieu, and Scaena was formed. Comprising a single playhouse, the domain can create any reality Lemont desires upon its stage. The Darklord&rsquo;s immersive performances are somewhat predictable, though, as they always end in slaughter.</p>

<p>The murderous pirate Pietra van Riese, captain of the <em>Relentless</em>, had an unsavory reputation for attaching her captives to ropes and dragging them through the water until they drowned. She never removed the detritus of her victims, even though some returned to life as zombies. The <em>Relentless</em> was ultimately sunk by rival captains, but death couldn&rsquo;t keep Pietra. She awoke in the Sea of Sorrows, water in her lungs and sea creatures making their homes in her flesh. Her crew stirred with her, now fish-eaten corpses. When Pietra sought to speak with them, her voice emerged from their mouths.</p>
<p>The <em>Relentless</em> sails a domain that can overlap any body of water in any other domain. Some domains border the Sea of Sorrows, while others have their own names for these mysterious waters. Those who venture into the Mists by boat might find themselves amid an endless, debris- and sargassum-choked expanse of eerie beasts and shifting islands, including the following:</p>

Even long generations after Kateri&rsquo;s death, members of the Shadowborn family still number among the Circle, their heroics known across the Shadowlands and in other domains. Yet despite their victories, the foes and failures of these knights are ever drawn back to the Shadowlands, filling it with vengeful souls and monsters. These include villains such as the necromancer Morgoroth; the fallen paladin Elena Faith-hold; and Ebonbane, Kateri Shadowborn&rsquo;s accursed sword.</p>

<p>In society, Anton Misroi presented himself as an upstanding gentleman. But within the walls of the prison over which he was warden, he was a sadist who believed righteousness was on his side. When his torturous punishments finally drove the prison&rsquo;s inmates to rise up, the bloody riot that ensued drew the attentions of the Dark Powers. During the uprising, Misroi was drowned in the swamps surrounding the prison. But he rose again soon after, an undead warden in search of inmates.</p>
<p>Beyond Misroi&rsquo;s prison, alligator-filled swamps cover the domain of Souragne right up to the sinking settlement of Port d&rsquo;Elhour and Marais d&rsquo;Tarascon, a village where above-ground crypts outnumber the residences of the living.</p>

Kas, though, was claimed by the Mists, and in his wasteland domain of Tovag, he believes his war with Vecna rages on. Patrols of prisoner-soldiers under undead commanders scour the land, dragooning strangers to serve in Kas&rsquo;s armies and to manufacture bizarre war machines. When Kas deems the time right, he sends his forces into the Mists, believing that Vecna&rsquo;s realm lies just beyond. Invariably, those troops never return, leaving the vampire to rage, rebuild his forces, and continue his search for the <wc-fetch type=item>Sword of Kas</wc-fetch> (detailed in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide), which he considers his key to victory.</p>

But if you plan to run whole campaigns set in the Land of the Mists, creating narratives that span domains can prove challenging if every realm is a world unto itself. Individuals who willfully brave the Mists to travel between domains are especially useful in your broader horror stories.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that most residents of the Domains of Dread never leave their home domains and wisely don&rsquo;t fixate on what lies beyond the Mists, some daring souls do. Many such inquisitive individuals simply vanish, the Mists delivering them to deadly domains from which they never return. But others manage to band together, learning the ways of the Mists, how to travel through them, and how to survive their dangers. Those who travel between domains might have the Mist Walker Dark Gift (see chapter 1) or know how to employ Mist talismans (detailed at the start of this chapter). Such travelers can provide the following services adventurers might find useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence of other domains</li>
<li>News, rumors, and requests for help</li>
<li>Information on Mist talismans</li>
<li>Guidance or traveling companions</li>
</ul>
<p>The characters in your adventures should feel special if they travel the Mists, as few have the courage to do so. When characters encounter travelers from other domains, those individuals should likewise be remarkable or have a desperate reason to have braved the Mists. Learning about such wanderers can drive the characters from a single adventure into a larger campaign that explores other domains.</p>
<p>The following sections present groups and individuals who routinely travel the Mists. The Strangers in the Mists table also suggests the kinds of people characters might encounter amid the Mists.</p>

This is true, but most who repeat that story are only trying to layer a mystical facade over their dilettante spiritualism.</p>
<p>Only the group&rsquo;s highest-ranking members know that the Keepers of the Feather began in Barovia as a small sect of Wereraven (see chapter 5) dedicated to opposing the evils of Strahd von Zarovich. Though their numbers were not enough to oppose the Darklord directly, they sought useful lore and aided brave souls from the shadows, manipulating fortune to confound some of Strahd&rsquo;s more diabolical plots. Over generations, the wereravens' hidden resistance to Strahd continued in Barovia, but some among them learned of other lands suffering beyond the Mists. Unwilling to let the innocents of those lands fend for themselves, some of the Keepers of the Feather ventured forth, hoping to share their wisdom and their subtle resistance to evil with those who needed it most.</p>
<p>However, the Mists find a way to twist even the best of intentions. In the cities of urbane domains like Borca, Darkon, and Dementlieu, the mystical writings and talismans the wereravens carried from Barovia came to the attention of the bored elite. Fascinated, these socialites became obsessed with the occult, seeking out esoteric works, hiring doubtful fortune-tellers, and hosting parlor sÃ©ances. In most cases, the results were passing fads. In some, they were catastrophicâ€”the unprepared successfully summoned fiends and angry spirits into their salons. But a few earnest amateur spiritualists genuinely sought to learn more about the secrets beyond their homes, their lives, and the Mists. In these would-be occultists, the wereravens saw potential.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Beyond Barovia, where the eldest wereraven members of the Keepers of the Feather keep a low profile, Keepers organize into small social clubs with shared interests in occultism. Some members are actual invested scholars, while others are simply bored rich folk. But all have a strong interest in sÃ©ances, fortune-telling, secrets of the afterlife, sightings of mysterious creatures, metaphysical theories, and tales of the macabre. Among their misinterpretations and outright flimflamâ€”like round planet theory and dikesha diceâ€”Keepers also possess hints of truth and the tools wereravens have long used to combat evil. Among these are spirit boards (detailed in chapter 4), tarokka decks, Mist talismans, and piecemeal occult writings from various domains. Some among the Keepers don&rsquo;t know the true power of these tools, but this doesn&rsquo;t dull their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Knowing the threats that Darklords and other evils pose, wereravens of the Keepers typically don&rsquo;t reveal themselves to those not of their kind. Rather, they infiltrate Keeper societies as reclusive members, traveling experts, or foreign scholars. Some Keepers also tell of sightings or visitations involving giant raven-like beings that appear, speak some prophecy or deliver some message, then vanish, often presaging either wonder or disaster. The wereravens take little issue with these exaggerated tales from those who&rsquo;ve witnessed their hybrid forms, and they willingly play into the tales of the Keepers if it means spurring them to action.</p>
<p>The Keepers of the Feather are a loose organization, incorporating members who operate alone or in small groups, as well as elite social clubs or secretive societies. In all cases, Keepers identify each other by the Mark of the Raven, a sunburst emblem worn as a pin or amulet. Drawn from esoteric writings, this mark is a recreation of the <wc-fetch type=item>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</wc-fetch>, a storied religious artifact from Barovia. Though these reproductions carry no magical properties and most non-wereraven Keepers don&rsquo;t know the symbol&rsquo;s origin, many foul forces instinctively recognize the symbol as an emblem of good.</p>

To facilitate this, the wereravens have taught some Keepers how to raise messenger ravens capable of delivering letters through the Mists. Most non-Keepers who learn of this consider it a trick, or fear what it means to receive messages from beyond the Mists, encouraging the Keepers to offer this rare service only to group members and their allies. Keeper ravens as a means of correspondence is detailed in &ldquo;Life in the Domains of Dread&rdquo; earlier in this chapter.</p>

Following itinerant traditions, many Vistani travel between domains, learning much of hidden lands, the many faces of evil, and the strange wonders of the Mists. A people unto themselves, Vistani refuse to be captives of a single domain, the Mists, or any terror.</p>
<h4 id=vistani-culture>

Although they trace their origins to the same world as Barovia, many Vistani look toward the future, learning from their traditions and from one another to better face whatever lies ahead.</p>
<p>Vistani bands consist primarily of one or more extended human families who can trace their heritage back to age-old Vistani clans. Over generations of exploring the Mists, though, individuals of other ancestries have been accepted into some clans and now are full-fledged members of Vistani culture (see the &ldquo;Vistani Characters&rdquo; sidebar for details).</p>
<p>As they travel, members of a Vistani band walk, ride on horseback, and drive ledge wagons, stopping at night to set up camp. Vistani bands occasionally camp near welcoming communities to trade and resupply, but rarely stay more than a weekâ€”though this can be complicated if a Darklord closes a domain&rsquo;s borders. Most bands make their living primarily through craftwork (especially delicate silversmithing), horse rearing, and trading wares carried between domains.</p>
<p>Meetings between Vistani bands are opportunities to trade, catch up with friends, and share both news and warnings of dangers ahead or behind.</p>

Spellcasters aren&rsquo;t uncommon among Vistani bands, with many favoring divination magic for the practical help it provides in avoiding danger. Spellcasters often incorporate their people&rsquo;s traditional divination tools into their spellcasting, including the fortune-telling cards called tarokka decks.</p>
<p>With their experience navigating the Mists, many Vistani understand how to employ Mist talismans (detailed at the start of this chapter) to reach specific domains, or possess the Mist Walker Dark Gift (see chapter 1), allowing them to make their way between domains. Vistani don&rsquo;t enter the Mists lightly, though, knowing that each such passage holds inherent danger. Caravan leaders ensure that every family member is accounted for before moving on, ensuring no one gets lost in the Mists.</p>

<li>The Mists are more than weather and are manipulated by forces that seem fickle and often cruel.</li>
<li>The Mists can carry travelers between lands and can be coerced but never controlled.</li>
<li>Evil is real and embodied by individuals of terrible power.</li>
<li>Time, reality, and memory don&rsquo;t always move in reliable ways, particularly between domains.</li>
<li>One might glimpse their fortune, but such things endlessly shift. Every soul makes their own fate.</li>

As the only outsiders that some remote communities see in the course of a year, the news and goods Vistani bring ensures a genuine welcome and renewal of longstanding trade relationships. Some more dismal communities view Vistani with suspicion, though, being wary of anyone who emerges from the Mists. But even these communities often find the lure of news and trade too tempting to forgo entirely.</p>
<p>Most people who live among the Domains of Dread know the following things about Vistani:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don&rsquo;t fear the Mists and can travel safely through the Mists to other lands.</li>
<li>They carry goods and stories from far-off lands.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re protective of their families, which includes members of other caravans.</li>
<li>Most don&rsquo;t discuss their culture or beliefs with outsiders.</li>
<li>Their travel routes are unpredictable, and a community might go years without seeing a Vistani caravan.</li>

Vistani caravans sometimes take pity on those who ask them for help, especially strangers from unfamiliar lands hopelessly searching for home, allowing such wayfarers to travel with them as far as the next settlement. In rare cases, a clan might even adopt a gracious, helpful traveler.</p>
<p>Characters who befriend or do right by members of a Vistani band might be allowed to take shelter or travel with a caravan for a time. But Vistani travelers quickly share tales of danger and of those who&rsquo;ve wronged them with other caravans, and those who slight one Vistana often meet others who share a grudge against them.</p>

<p><strong>Did you leave your clan&rsquo;s caravan?</strong> If so, are you seeking to right a wrong done to them, or to spare them from harm? If not, how do you balance your adventures with your family&rsquo;s travels? Are there ways you and your family keep tabs on one another?</p>
<p><strong>How much do you know about navigating the Mists?</strong> Do you know how to travel between domains? Do you use divination magic to guide your fate? Or do you know little about it, having left navigation to others?</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about being away from your people?</strong> Do you enjoy socializing with a variety of people? Did you seek a settled life? Do you want to finish your tasks quickly and return to your family?</p>

The individuals noted here number among the most famous Vistani band leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hyskosa.</b> A renowned poet and storyteller, Hyskosa leads a caravan that embraces the Mists and goes where they lead it. As a result, his clan is unmoored from time and reality, appearing in different ages, in strange versions and configurations of domains, and even on worlds beyond the Domains of Dread. His lyrical accounts of his travels are often viewed as prophecies.</li>
<li><b>Madame Eva.</b> A controversial figure among Vistani, Madame Eva made a bargain with the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich. As a result, the evils that lurk in Barovia avoid Vistani. However, Madame Eva and her followers occasionally ally with the infamous count, giving them a sinister reputation. Madame Eva and her unique band of Vistani are detailed in the adventure Curse of Strahd.</li>
<li><b>Mother Luba.</b> The halfling Mother Luba is known for putting unquiet spirits to rest and transporting wayward souls through the Mists to their rightful homes. Those wicked spirits beyond her aid she trapped within her tarokka deck, which became known as <wc-fetch type=item>Luba&rsquo;s Tarokka of Souls</wc-fetch> (detailed in Tasha&rsquo;s Cauldron of Everything).</li>

With no domain-spanning organization, the church serves largely as a formalization of local superstitions, whether in modest rural temples or urban cathedrals.

Since Azalin&rsquo;s disappearance (see &ldquo;Darkon&rdquo; earlier in this chapter), the Kargat enforces the will of fractious, power-hungry leaders. The organization is in turn served by the Kargatane, a cultish lower echelon of mortals drawn to service with promises of wealth and supernatural power. Long-serving members of the Kargatane earn transformation into dhampirs (see chapter 1), the first step toward becoming a member of the Kargat and attaining immortality.

In the case of dangers they can&rsquo;t destroy, the Guardians hope to prevent calamities by containing them within hidden, heavily warded, vault-like monasteries. Over generations, these sites have become repositories of incredible secrets and great evil that members of the order struggle to contain. Guardian monasteries are hidden in multiple domains, with the best known being Watchers' Stronghold in Darkon. Power-hungry groups and unscrupulous lore seekers, such as the Kargat and the priests of Osybus, often target these ancient vaults, seeking powers few can hope to control. The Guardians might share goals with characters trying to prevent supernatural dangers, but they just as easily could consider characters threats themselves.</p>

With their foul immortality, they work to unshackle the first Darklord, Strahd von Zarovich, from the Domains of Dread. This inspires them to learn all they can about the nature of the Mists and its deepest mysteries. The priests spread their teachings, forming shadowy cults that draw adventurers into their schemes. These villains are further detailed in chapter 5.</p>

These inquisitors employ varied psionic powers to stamp out evil, but their zeal and willingness to peer into others' minds mean that many fear them just as much as the villains they oppose. Cells of the Ulmist Inquisition might be found within any domain and often ally with the Church of Ezra while opposing the priests of Osybus. Ulmist inquisitors might ally with characters against evil, but they are just as likely to see corruption within adventurers' souls. These inquisitors are further detailed in chapter 5.</p>

The century-old elf has a knack for seeing through falsehoods, a talent aided by decades of experience and science-driven deductive methods.</p>
<p>As a young detective in Darkon, Alanik revealed his father&rsquo;s criminal empire and oversaw its destruction. His success launched his career as a private detective, embroiling him in the intrigues of Martira Bay&rsquo;s nobility. During this time, he met the young physician Arthur Sedgwick, who became his partner and saved Alanik&rsquo;s life countless times. The pair&rsquo;s adventuresâ€”including several deadly encounters with the Kargatâ€”eventually led them to relocate to Port-a-Lucine in Dementlieu. A mystery involving a shape-shifting serial killer resulted in a fall from a roof that paralyzed Alanik&rsquo;s legs. Within the following month, the pair created a custom wheelchair for Alanik, and they married.</p>
<p>Today, Alanik Ray and Arthur Sedgwick investigate mysteries wherever need and novelty take them. Arthur lends his practicality and martial skill to Alanik&rsquo;s dazzling intellect during the pair&rsquo;s exploits. Sedgwick also chronicles their adventures and has published two volumes to date: <em>The Life of Alanik Ray</em> and <em>The Casebook of Alanik Ray</em>.</p>

Despite his experience with the paranormal, he relies on his husband Arthur to keep him out of true supernatural peril. Still, the detectives manage to find trouble wherever they go. Use the statistics of Spy to approximate both Alanik Ray and Arthur Sedgwick. Consider the following plots when featuring the detectives in your adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alanik is confounded by a murderer preying on a family. Arthur discovers that these murders repeat in a centuries-long cycle and seeks detectives with greater supernatural experience.</li>
<li>Alanik exposes a community&rsquo;s constabulary, whose members accuse individuals of crimes before the offenses occur. He seeks help in dismantling the dangerous system.</li>
<li>A serial killer called the Midnight Slasher leaves behind gory messages such as, &ldquo;I live in your city&rdquo; and &ldquo;I lurk in your nightmares.&rdquo; When the characters meet Alanik, he reveals that these messages appear at crime scenes in multiple communities, on the same nights.</li>

The Caller numbers among the most notorious supernatural figures in the Land of the Mists, and where it walks, doom inevitably follows.</p>
<p>The Caller appears as a comely individual of any gender, which takes disarming forms to gain the trust of a specific individual. Whether as a friend, paramour, mentor, or rival, the Caller isolates its target, leading the victim to depend on it emotionally or materially. Over time, the Caller coerces or outright forces its victim to acts of deepening selfishness and immorality. Then when the target reaches a peak of depravity or despair, the Caller abandons its mark, leaving them to face the consequences. The suffering the Caller causes is never isolated, triggering a tragic chain of events that can throw a family, a community, or a whole domain into anguish. Those investigating the history of a calamity might discover generations-spanning cycles of the Caller&rsquo;s manipulations. These schemes shape a mysterious agendaâ€”one gradually molding the Land of the Mists to a nefarious purpose.</p>

Use the Caller to create adventures involving secret histories, domain-spanning conspiracies, and truths hinting at the nature of the Dark Powers. Consider the following plots when featuring the Caller in an adventure:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the characters' allies requests they check in on the ally&rsquo;s brother. This pious or artistic soul has been convinced by a charming peer (the Caller in disguise) to attend a retreat that is secretly a meeting of the priests of Osybus.</li>
<li>An old friend reappears in a character&rsquo;s life. Likable and knowledgeable but shy, this friend assists the character without recompense. Eventually, the friend (actually the Caller) gets into trouble and needs the character to do them a number of increasingly unscrupulous favors.</li>
<li>A powerful individual such as Firan Zal&rsquo;honan (see below), Isolde (see &ldquo;The Carnival&rdquo; earlier in this chapter), or a domain&rsquo;s Darklord summons the party and requests they hunt down the Caller. This figure provides their agents with a device that allows the bearers to travel to whatever domain the Caller is currently in.</li>

They haven&rsquo;t been entirely terrible, either.</p>
<p>The ghostly son of Ingrid and Rudolph van Richten (detailed later in this section) follows his father, trying to aid him and ever wishing he could let his father know he&rsquo;s okay. But the interaction of Rudolph&rsquo;s curse and Erasmus&rsquo;s unique nature prevents the elder van Richten from perceiving his son&rsquo;s ghostly existence. Erasmus could have become a sorrowful bystander, but his unfaltering empathy and the circle of kind souls in van Richten&rsquo;s orbit have kept him engaged over the years.</p>
<p>Erasmus is a unique spirit. His behavior and rare appearances mark him as a thoughtful, art-loving teenager. He can&rsquo;t express himself as fully as he&rsquo;d like, since he can appear for only a few minutes every day and can&rsquo;t speak. However, he can manipulate ectoplasm to paint colorful, floating symbols and images. When possible, he depicts information and conveys emotions or warnings. Erasmus&rsquo;s art is fleeting, though, vanishing in seconds. Sadly, his father cannot perceive him or any manifestation he creates.</p>
<p>While traveling with his father, Erasmus bonds with Rudolph&rsquo;s allies. Aromantic yet deeply affectionate, Erasmus delights in frequenting the rooms of those he cares about, leaving behind colorful greetings. He never pushes others to reveal his presence, though, since attempts to do so only cause Rudolph pain.</p>

Eventually, they kidnapped Erasmus van Richten and sold him to his death at the hands of the vampire Baron Metus. In the brief time she knew him, Ez befriended Erasmus and heard him speak lovingly of a different sort of family than the one she knew. When Erasmus&rsquo;s father, Rudolph van Richten, tracked her family down and delivered her mother to justice, Ez didn&rsquo;t stop him.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Ez joined a Vistani band, adopted the name Ez d&rsquo;Avenir, and traveled far but never found the belonging Erasmus described. Eventually she sought out someone she knew could tell her more: Rudolph van Richten. After a wary introduction, Ez met van Richten and studied with him for a time, learning all she could of hunting deadly creatures. Although her and Rudolph&rsquo;s personalities clashed, Ez was surprised to reconnect with Erasmus, now a ghost. She and the spirit renewed their friendship and ultimately discovered paths beyond Rudolph van Richten&rsquo;s obsession. Rather than let her relationship with the doctor turn sour, Ez departed Mordentshire to hunt evil and find a family on her own terms.</p>

</span></p>
<p>A mask of charm and congeniality conceals one of the most ingenious and utterly ruthless intellects to stalk through the Mists. A wandering scholar, Firan Zal&rsquo;honan is quick to claim his descent from a noble pedigree. In another life, he claims, he could have ruled as a wizard-king. But his brilliance led him along a stranger path: seeking to escape the Mists into the &ldquo;true realities&rdquo; beyond. Firan keeps the basis for his strange theories secret, but his ambitions drive him to travel the domains; visit accursed sites; and investigate inscrutable prophecy cycles, temporal conjunctions, and an unknown figure he calls &ldquo;the escapee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all his arrogance, Firan dreads the Mists and seeks assistance traversing them. His most noteworthy partner is the Vistani leader Madame Eva, who secretly allows him to barter strange secrets for her agents' guidance through the Mists.</p>
<p>Firan is an enigmatic and abrasive expert, but his knowledge of the domains and their secrets is without peer. His research causes him to regularly cross paths with other sinister scholars, such as the priests of Osybus, a group he&rsquo;s equally likely to aid or oppose as his investigations demand. Firan&rsquo;s eccentricities include loathing the domain of Darkon, an almost-personal hatred for Barovia&rsquo;s Count Strahd von Zarovich, and his earnest fear of the Mistsâ€”he claims that if he entered them unguided, he would never escape. However, those who prove useful to him can earn a valuable temporary ally.</p>

After defeating his master, he wandered far, struggling against his vampiric urges and eventually falling in love with an adventurer named Anna, who claimed to be from another world. When Jander revealed his true nature, Anna&rsquo;s companions assisted her in fleeing him. In a rage, Jander slew all those he blamed for keeping him and Anna apart. In the aftermath of the slaughter, the Mists gathered around Jander, transporting him to Barovia. There, Jander met Strahd von Zarovich and lived in Castle Ravenloft for a time. When the elder vampire sought to make Jander his servant, Jander tried to slay the count, failed, and fled into the Mists.</p>
<p>In the centuries that followed, Jander wandered as a mysterious adventurer, secretly seeking a cure for vampirism. He&rsquo;s discovered multiple remedies, but none work for him. In recent decades, his attempt to save a fellow adventurer resulted in the birth of Savra Sunstar, a dhampir (see chapter 1) who Jander considers his daughter. Savra loathes him, though, and has devoted her life to hunting him and all vampires.</p>
<p>This estrangement pushed Jander to seek more radical methods of expunging his vampirism. Assisting in the experiments of a mysterious alchemist in Mordent, he became the first to test a prototype of the enigmatic Apparatus (see &ldquo;Mordent&rdquo; earlier in the chapter). But the machine malfunctioned; instead of purging his vampirism, it created myriad copies of him, scattered across the planes. All believe they&rsquo;re the real Jander, though an improbable number of them have already achieved semi-tragic ends. At least one Jander remains trapped in Ravenloft, forever seeking a peace he&rsquo;ll never deserve.</p>

<p>In fairer days, Rudolph lived with his wife, Ingrid, and son, Erasmus, in their family home outside Rivalis in the domain of Darkon. Brash and recently established as a medical doctor, Rudolph ran afoul of the Radanaviches, a family using Vistani traditions as a cover for brigandage. When the doctor refused to treat one of the family&rsquo;s mortally ill members, the group&rsquo;s leader, Irena Radanavich, ordered her band to kidnap Rudolph&rsquo;s son and then sold the young man to the vampire Baron Metus. Rudolph pursued the Radanaviches, shattered their criminal operation, and brought Irena to justice, but not before suffering her curse: &ldquo;Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws.&rdquo; In the weeks that followed, the curse took hold. Before Rudolph could track down and slay Baron Metus, the vampire murdered both Ingrid and Erasmus.</p>
<p>In the decades since, van Richten has hunted monsters and armed others with the knowledge they need to confront the dark. Though he&rsquo;s made many devoted allies, he keeps them at arm&rsquo;s length, fearing the threat of his curse. When not traveling, van Richten lives out of his herbalist&rsquo;s shop in Mordentshire in the domain of Mordent.</p>

After the twins saved van Richten and their uncle from the werewolf, both George and van Richten encouraged their investigative instincts, training them as monster hunters.</p>
<p>Ever since, Laurie and Gennifer have been relentless adventurers. Laurie, taking after her uncle, trained in martial techniques to combat the undead. She rarely travels without her companions Joan and Tirran, the grown pups of her uncle&rsquo;s foxhounds, and her uncle&rsquo;s magic sword, Gossamer.</p>
<p>Gennifer, working closely with van Richten, learned the medicine and traditions of numerous domains. She&rsquo;s conducted in-depth studies of lycanthropy to assist her and her sister in pursing Natalia Vhorishkova, who remains at large. Secretly, Gennifer fears she&rsquo;s infected with lycanthropy, and despite never exhibiting any signs of the curse, she takes medication of her own concoction to ward it off.</p>

Consider the following plots when featuring the twins in an adventure:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters have gotten in over their heads, and the Weathermay-Foxgrove twinsâ€”pursuing the same questâ€”come to the rescue. Afterward, the sisters encourage the party to participate in a training expedition to an infamous locale.</li>
<li>Gennifer has vanished. Laurie seeks aid, fearing that Natalia Vhorishkova kidnapped her. In truth, Gennifer&rsquo;s fear of turning into a lycanthrope has led her to head off on her ownâ€”and into greater danger.</li>
