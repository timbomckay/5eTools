<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>The main figures in any D&D campaign are the characters created by the players. The heroics, folly, righteousness, and potential villainy of your characters are at the heart of the story. This chapter provides a variety of new options for them, focusing on additional subclasses for each of the classes in the player&rsquo;s handbook.</p>
<p>Each class offers a character-defining choice at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level that unlocks a series of special features, not available to the class as a whole. That choice is called a subclass. Each class has a collective term that describes its subclasses; in the fighter, for instance, the subclasses are called martial archetypes, and in the paladin, they&rsquo;re sacred oaths. The table below identifies each of the subclasses in this book. In addition, the section for druids presents details on how the Wild Shape feature works, and the warlock receives a collection of new choices for the class&rsquo;s Eldritch Invocations feature.</p>
<p>Each of the class presentations leads off with advice on how to add depth and detail to your character&rsquo;s personality. You can use the tables in these sections as a source of inspiration, or roll a die to randomly determine a result if desired.</p>
<p>Following the subclasses, the section called &ldquo;this is your life&rdquo; presents a series of tables for adding detail to your character&rsquo;s backstory.</p>
<p>The chapter concludes with a selection of feats for the races in the player&rsquo;s handbook, offering ways to delve deeper into a character&rsquo;s racial identity.</p>

<p>The character creation rules in the player&rsquo;s handbook provide all the information you need to define your character in preparation for a life of adventuring. What they don&rsquo;t do is account for all the circumstances that shaped your character during the years between your birth and the start of your career as a member of a class.</p>
<p>What did your character accomplish or experience before deciding to become an adventurer? What were the circumstances of your birth? How large is your family, and what sorts of relationships do you have with your relatives? Which people were the greatest influences on you during your formative years, for better or worse?</p>
<p>To answer these questions and more, you can use the tables and the advice in this section to compose a well-developed backstory for your character-an autobiography of sorts-that you can use to inform how you roleplay the character. Your DM can draw from this material as the campaign proceeds, creating situations and scenarios that build off your previous life experiences.</p>
<h3 id=ideas-not-rules>
<a href=#ideas-not-rules class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Ideas, Not Rules</h3><p>Even though these pages are full of tables and die rolls, they don&rsquo;t make up a rules system-in fact, the opposite is true. You can use as much or as little of this material as you desire, and you can make decisions in any order you want.</p>
<p>For instance, you might not want these tables to help you decide who your parents and siblings are, because that&rsquo;s among the information you&rsquo;ve already come up with. But you can still use other parts, such as the section on life events, to provide added depth and detail.</p>
<h4 id=how-and-when-to-use-the-tables>
<a href=#how-and-when-to-use-the-tables class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>How and When to Use the Tables</h4><p>If you&rsquo;re comfortable with letting the dice decide a certain fact about your character, go ahead and roll. If not, you can take charge and make the decision, choosing from among the possibilities on a table. Of course, you also have the option of disregarding the result of a die roll if it conflicts with another result. Likewise, if the text instructs you to roll on a table, that&rsquo;s not meant to be taken literally. You can always make your own choice.</p>
<p>Although these tables are meant to augment the step-by-step character creation process in the player&rsquo;s handbook, they don&rsquo;t occupy a specific place in that process. You can use some of them early on-for instance, it&rsquo;s possible to determine your parents and other family members immediately after deciding your character&rsquo;s race-but you could also wait until later in the process. You might prefer to establish more facts about your character&rsquo;s game identity-such as your class, ability scores, and alignment-before supplementing that information with what&rsquo;s offered here.</p>

When you&rsquo;re done, you will have a summary of facts about your parents, your siblings, and the circumstances under which you grew up.</p>

When a result mentions such a person, you can use the supplemental tables to add needed details-such as race, class, or occupation-to that person. Some tables in the other sections direct you to one or more of the supplemental tables, and you can also use them any other time you see fit.</p>
<h3 id=origins-1>
<a href=#origins-1 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Origins</h3><p>The usual first step in creating your character&rsquo;s life story is to determine your early circumstances. Who were your parents? Where were you born? Did you have any siblings? Who raised you? You can address these questions by using the following tables.</p>
<h4 id=parents>
<a href=#parents class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Parents</h4><p>You had parents, of course, even if they didn&rsquo;t raise you. To determine what you know about these people, use the Parents table. If you want, you can roll separately on the table for your mother and your father. Use the supplemental tables as desired (particularly Class, Occupation, and Alignment) to learn more about your parents.</p>
<h5 id=nonhuman-parents>
<a href=#nonhuman-parents class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Nonhuman Parents</h5><p>If your character is a half-elf, a half-orc, or a tiefling, you can use one of the tables below to determine the race of each of your parents.

<p>Use the Family table to determine who raised you. If you know who your parents are but you get a result that does not mention one or both of them, use the Absent Parent table to determine what happened.</p>
<p>Next, refer to the Family Lifestyle table to determine the general circumstances of your upbringing. (Chapter 5 of the player&rsquo;s handbook has more information about lifestyles.) The result on that table includes a number that is applied to your roll on the Childhood Home table, which tells you where you spent your early years.

Life events include wondrous happenings and tragedies, conflicts and successes, and encounters with the unusual. They can help to explain why your character became an adventurer, and some might still affect your life even after they are long over.</p>
<p>The older a character is, the greater the chance for multiple life events, as shown on the Life Events by Age table. If you have already chosen your character&rsquo;s starting age, see the entry in the Life Events column that corresponds to how old you are. Otherwise, you can roll dice to determine your current age and number of life events randomly.</p>
<p>After you know the number of life events your character has experienced, roll once on the Life Events table for each of them. Many of the results on that table direct you to one of the secondary tables that follow. Once you have determined all of your character&rsquo;s life events, you can arrange them in any chronological order you see fit.</p>

Sometimes that might be all the information you want, but you don&rsquo;t have to stop there.</p>
<p>By using your creativity to stitch all these bits together into a continuous narrative, you can create a full-fledged autobiography for your character in as little as a few sentences-an excellent example of how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Did you get a couple of results on the tables that don&rsquo;t outright contradict each other but also don&rsquo;t seem to fit together smoothly? If so, now is your chance to explain what happened to you. For instance, let&rsquo;s say you were born in a castle, but your childhood home was in the wilderness. It could be that your parents traveled from their forest home to seek help from a midwife at the castle when your mother was close to giving birth. Or your parents might have been members of the castle&rsquo;s staff before you were born, but they were released from service soon after you came into the world.</p>
<p>In addition to deepening your own roleplaying experience, your character&rsquo;s history presents your DM with opportunities to weave those elements into the story of the campaign. Any way you look at it, adding definition to your character&rsquo;s pre-adventuring life is time well spent.</p>

Some DMs also allow the use of feats to customize a character. Feats are an optional rule in chapter 6, &ldquo;Customization Options,&rdquo; of the player&rsquo;s handbook. The DM decides whether they&rsquo;re used and may also decide that some feats are available in a campaign and others aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This section introduces a collection of special feats that allow you to explore your character&rsquo;s race further. These feats are each associated with a race from the Player&rsquo;s Handbook, as summarized in the Racial Feats table. A racial feat represents either a deepening connection to your race&rsquo;s culture or a physical transformation that brings you closer to an aspect of your race&rsquo;s lineage.</p>
<p>The cause of a particular transformation is up to you and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a latent quality that has emerged as you age, or a transformation might be the result of an event in the campaign, such as exposure to powerful magic or visiting a place of ancient significance to your race. Transformations are a fundamental motif of fantasy literature and folklore. Figuring out why your character has changed can be a rich addition to your campaign&rsquo;s story.</p>
