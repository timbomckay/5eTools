<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. The terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame blossoms from a wizard&rsquo;s spell. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters.</p>
<p>Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.</p>
<p>This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. &ldquo;You&rdquo; can also mean the character or monster that you control.</p>

<li>
<p>The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries areâ€”how far away and in what direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</p>

<li>
<p>When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</p>

The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p>
<h3 id=surprise>
<a href=#surprise class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Surprise</h3><p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.</p>
<p>The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn&rsquo;t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re surprised, you can&rsquo;t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can&rsquo;t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id=initiative>
<a href=#initiative class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Initiative</h3><p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.</p>
<p>The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p>
<p>If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>

You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speedâ€”sometimes called your walking speedâ€”is noted on your character sheet.</p>
<p>The most common actions you can take are described in the &ldquo;Actions in Combat&rdquo; section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Movement and Position&rdquo; section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.</p>
<p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can&rsquo;t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the <wc-fetch type=action>Dodge</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=action>Ready</wc-fetch> action, as described in &ldquo;Actions in Combat.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id=bonus-actions>
<a href=#bonus-actions class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Bonus Actions</h4><p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don&rsquo;t have a bonus action to take.</p>
<p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p>
<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action&rsquo;s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p>

<p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>
<p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>
<p>The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p>

A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else&rsquo;s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.</p>
<p>When you take a reaction, you can&rsquo;t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature&rsquo;s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>
<h2 id=movement-and-position>
<a href=#movement-and-position class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Movement and Position</h2><p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p>
<p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you&rsquo;re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Special Types of Movement&rdquo; section in chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.</p>
<h3 id=breaking-up-your-move>
<a href=#breaking-up-your-move class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Breaking Up Your Move</h3><p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>
<h4 id=moving-between-attacks>
<a href=#moving-between-attacks class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Moving between Attacks</h4><p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>
<h4 id=using-different-speeds>
<a href=#using-different-speeds class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Using Different Speeds</h4><p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you&rsquo;ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can&rsquo;t use the new speed during the current move.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p>

<p>Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircasesâ€”the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>

In the game, they are <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>, a condition described in the appendix.</p>
<p>You can drop <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can&rsquo;t stand up if you don&rsquo;t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
<p>To move while <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p>

A typical Medium creature isn&rsquo;t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can&rsquo;t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p>
<p>A creature&rsquo;s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there&rsquo;s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p>
<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature.</p>
<p>If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there&rsquo;s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>

Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that&rsquo;s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it&rsquo;s in the smaller space.</p>

<p><strong>Squares:</strong> Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.</p>
<p>If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Entering a Square:</strong> To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you&rsquo;re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)</p>
<p>If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Corners:</strong> Diagonal movement can&rsquo;t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.</p>
<p><strong>Ranges:</strong> To determine the range on a grid between two thingsâ€”whether creatures or objectsâ€”start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.</p>

<p>When you attack a target that you can&rsquo;t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you&rsquo;re guessing the target&rsquo;s location or you&rsquo;re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn&rsquo;t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target&rsquo;s location correctly.</p>
<p>When a creature can&rsquo;t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.</p>
<p>If you are hiddenâ€”both unseen and unheardâ€”when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p>

<p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can&rsquo;t attack a target beyond this range.</p>
<p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range.

A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p>
<p>Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>

You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.</p>
<p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature&rsquo;s movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.</p>
<p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the <wc-fetch type=action>Disengage</wc-fetch> action. You also don&rsquo;t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don&rsquo;t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe&rsquo;s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</p>

<p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p>

A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</p>
<p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren&rsquo;t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>half cover</strong> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>three-quarters</strong> cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>total cover</strong> can&rsquo;t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p>

<p>When attacking with a <strong>weapon</strong>, you add your ability modifierâ€”the same modifier used for the attack roll to the damage. A <strong>spell</strong> tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.</p>

<p>If a creature or an object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p>
<p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p>
<p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p>

Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature&rsquo;s hit points (as explained in chapter 8), and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.</p>
<p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature&rsquo;s hit points can&rsquo;t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p>
<p>A creature that has died can&rsquo;t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.</p>

Unlike other saving throws, this one isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.</p>
<p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p>

If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn&rsquo;t killed by a failed death saving throw.</p>
<p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>A stable creature doesn&rsquo;t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn&rsquo;t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p>

<p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them fall <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> and follow the same rules as player characters.</p>

Temporary hit points aren&rsquo;t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p>
<p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p>
<p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p>
<p>Healing can&rsquo;t restore temporary hit points, and they can&rsquo;t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p>
<p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn&rsquo;t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.</p>
<p>They can still absorb damage directed at you while you&rsquo;re in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p>
<p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they&rsquo;re depleted or you finish a long rest.</p>

<p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p>
<h3 id=mounting-and-dismounting>
<a href=#mounting-and-dismounting class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Mounting and Dismounting</h3><p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can&rsquo;t mount it if you don&rsquo;t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
<p>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you&rsquo;re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> in a space within 5 feet of it. If you&rsquo;re knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.</p>
<p>If your mount is knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> in a space within 5 feet it.</p>

You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.</p>
<p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training.</p>
<p>The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: <wc-fetch type=action>Dash</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=action>Disengage</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=action>Dodge</wc-fetch>. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p>
<p>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.</p>
<p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you&rsquo;re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p>

Underwater the following rules apply.</p>
<p>When making a <strong>melee weapon attack</strong>, a creature that doesn&rsquo;t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.</p>
<p>A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target beyond the weapon&rsquo;s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).</p>
<p>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.</p>
