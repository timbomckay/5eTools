<div class="gap-8 lg:grid items-start" style="grid-template-columns:auto 10rem">
<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Religion plays an important role in Eberron. The gods don&rsquo;t manifest physically, but people of faith believe that divine forces shape everyday life. Shared beliefs unite communities and can provide hope in difficult times.</p>
<p>Most Khorvairians acknowledge the pantheon of the Sovereign Host and its malign shadow, the Dark Six. The Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of the Kingdom of Galifar and holds sway over most of Khorvaireâ€”except for Thrane, which favors the Church of the Silver Flame. Other religions connect specific cultures or communities; the kalashtar observe the Path of Light, and the Undying Court guides the elves of Aerenal.</p>
<p>Religion is especially important for a paladin, cleric, or druid, yet any character can have faith in a higher power. Following a religion is a way to give your character a deeper connection to the world and a bond to other members of the community. The Foundation of Faith table can provide ideas for the source of your beliefs.</p>
<p>Conversely, a lack of faith can also be a meaningful part of your story. If you don&rsquo;t believe in any divine power, what caused such doubt? The Rejection of Faith table offers ideas that can help shape your story.</p>

<li>The Sovereigns are with us at all times. Onatar stands at every forge, and Dol Dorn is with you whenever blades are drawn.</li>
<li>The Sovereigns shape the world. They offer us guidance and strength, but we must learn to listen.</li>
<li>Honor every Sovereign in their place and time. If you hear one voice clearly, embrace their path.</li>
<li>As a follower of the Sovereign Host, you believe that the hand of the Sovereigns can be seen in all things. What others take to be intuition or instinct, you see as the voice of the Sovereigns offering guidance. You don&rsquo;t need absolute proof; the fact of a bountiful harvest is evidence of Arawai&rsquo;s benevolence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pantheon of the Sovereign Host embodies all that is good in the world. The people of Khorvaire have followed the Sovereigns for thousands of years, and everyone knows the names of the Sovereigns and the Dark Six. Even people who aren&rsquo;t devout might still swear by the Sovereigns or offer a prayer in a moment of crisis.</p>
<p>The Sovereign Host is wondrously diverse. Variations and subsects of the faith thrive, and temples are only loosely aligned. In a small community, a skilled smith might double as the priest because people believe he&rsquo;s close to Onatar. A midwife might symbolically speak for Arawai and Boldrei. Typically, the faithful are united by their shared beliefs; no central authority seeks to enforce a singular creed.</p>
<p>As a Vassalâ€”a follower of the Sovereign Hostâ€”you might feel connection to a particular Sovereign, but still show reverence to each. Your background can influence your particular interpretation of the Sovereignsâ€”the Talenta halflings consider the Sovereigns part of a pantheon of spirits, while some Karrns honor only the Sovereigns of warâ€”but any character can be a Vassal.</p>
<h3 id=sovereigns>
<a href=#sovereigns class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Sovereigns</h3><p>These common names and attributes describe the nine Sovereigns as they are worshiped in Khorvaire:</p>
<p><strong>Arawai</strong> is the Sovereign of Life and Love. She is the patron of fertility and of the benevolent aspects of nature, bringing good harvest and gentle rain.</p>
<p><strong>Aureon</strong> is the Sovereign of Law and Lore. He is considered the first wizard, who shared the secrets of wizardry with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Balinor</strong> is the Sovereign of Horn and Hunt. He guides both the beast and the hunter, and he is the patron of those who walk on the edge of civilization and the natural world.</p>
<p><strong>Boldrei</strong> is the Sovereign of Hall and Hearth. She guides and protects communities and families, inspiring people to work together for the common good.</p>
<p><strong>Dol Arrah</strong> is the sun that drives away the darkness. She stands for wisdom in war and for those who fight with honor, pursue justice, and make sacrifices for the greater good.</p>
<p><strong>Dol Dorn</strong> is the Sovereign of Strength and Steel. He is the patron of the common soldier, and he guides the hands of anyone who holds a weapon. He embodies courage, strength, and martial skill.</p>
<p><strong>Kol Korran</strong> is the Sovereign of World and Wealth. He guards travelers and guides traders. Although the Trickery domain is suggested for his clerics, Kol Korran guides fair negotiation; those driven solely by greed prefer the Keeper of the Dark Six.</p>
<p><strong>Olladra</strong> is the Sovereign of Feast and Fortune. She is the giver of joy and the granter of luck, patron to entertainers, gamblers, and anyone who takes a chance.</p>
<p><strong>Onatar</strong> is the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He guides both mundane smiths and artificers, inspiring anyone who performs an act of creation.</p>

A Sovereign priest either carries a metal Octagram holy symbol or holds a staff tipped with the icon. Priests dedicated to a particular god also display their deity&rsquo;s symbol, and Vassals carry tokens with the symbols of the Sovereigns whose favor they seek. There are eight points in the symbol for eight Sovereigns; the ninth Sovereign (Aureon) is represented by the Octagram itself.</p>
<h3 id=rites>
<a href=#rites class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Rites</h3><p>Formal prayers to the Sovereigns usually involve song. Specific songs invoke each Sovereign and seek their favor, appreciate the blessings received, and recognize the presence of a Sovereign. Celebrants sing the songs of Boldrei and Aureon at weddings, and soldiers sing Dol Dorn&rsquo;s marching songs on the move and Dol Arrah&rsquo;s hymns on the dawn before a battle.</p>
<h3 id=temples>
<a href=#temples class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Temples</h3><p>Sovereign shrines arise where people feel the deities are close, such as a library for Aureon or a smithy for Onatar. The rites of Boldrei or Arawai typically occur in the wild, and a tavern could serve as a shrine to Olladra. The shrines can take any form, but they prominently display the symbol of the particular Sovereign.</p>
<p>Temple of the Sovereign Host are made of stone and have eight doors. The walls depict images of the Sovereigns, with the icon of Aureon over the altar and the Octagram engraved on the floor.</p>
<h2 id=dark-six>
<a href=#dark-six class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Dark Six</h2><p>The Dark Six are the shadows of the Sovereign Host. These dark gods shape the world and are present at all times, speaking to those willing to hear them. Where the Sovereigns govern positive forces, the Dark Six are the source of fears. Arawai and Balinor reflect the positive aspects of nature. The devastating storm, the earthquake, the wildfire? These are the work of the Devourer.</p>

Yet correspondents at the <em>Voice of Thrane</em> have uncovered a shocking phenomenon: long-standing cults that worship members of the Dark Six alongside the Sovereign Host.</p>
<p>Most of you know of the Restful Watch, the priests who tend Vassal cemeteries. What you may not know is that the priests of the Watch honor both Aureon and the Keeper! They say that the Keeper snatches the souls of heroes so they can be preserved from Dolurrh and returned when they are needed once more.</p>
<p>Worse still is the Three Faces of War, a cult that worships the Sovereigns of Warâ€”including the Mockery, whom they call Dol Azur. Followers of this foul faith say that the battlefield holds a place for all of these gods, explicitly embracing a deity they acknowledge as the patron of treachery and terror! This cult apparently began in the Karrnathi military but spread across the Five Nations during the Last War. So next time you&rsquo;re talking to a Brelish soldier, remember that they might be a devotee of the Mockery!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dark Six and the Sovereign Host are opposite sides of the same coin. If you believe in one, you acknowledge the existence of the other. The only question is whether you fear the Six or revere them. Those who choose to follow these sinister deities embrace darkness. A barbarian may thank the Fury for the gift of rage. An assassin walks the path of the Mockery, while a warlock&rsquo;s pact may be a gift of the Shadow.</p>
<p>The Dark Six inspire worship in different ways among diverse cultures. Temples to the Dark Six appear in Droaam, along with wild revels driven by the Fury. The Dark Six aren&rsquo;t worshiped openly elsewhere in Khorvaire; the gods' shrines are hidden, and it&rsquo;s more common to find a cult devoted to a single member of the Six than a temple dedicated to the entire pantheon.</p>

<p><strong>The Devourer</strong> governs the destructive power of nature, both pure elemental force and savagery in beasts.</p>
<p><strong>The Keeper</strong> snatches souls before they can reach Dolurrh and hoards them along with his vast wealth. Those driven by greed call him their patron, and his priests often act as criminal fixers.</p>
<p><strong>The Fury</strong> governs both passion and revenge, rage and despair. She offers revenge to those who have been wronged, but her vengeance often leads to suffering.</p>
<p><strong>The Mockery</strong> is the patron of treachery and of terror in battle. He guides those who seek victory through guile, both warriors and assassins. He was once the brother of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah, but he was stripped of his skin and his name after betraying them.</p>
<p><strong>The Shadow</strong> is the dark side of knowledge and ambition. It&rsquo;s said to be Aureon&rsquo;s shadow, given malign life when Aureon mastered magic. The Shadow is the maker of monsters and the keeper of forbidden secrets, and it offers malevolent spells to warlocks and wizards.</p>
<p><strong>The Traveler</strong> asserts that chaos drives evolution and that change makes us stronger. The Traveler is a trickster and the giver of dangerous gifts. Some artificers worship the Traveler, seeing it as the lord of innovation, but the gifts of the Traveler always have unexpected consequences.</p>

The Deities of Eberron table lists the common symbols of the individual gods. However, since the Six aren&rsquo;t worshiped openly in most of Khorvaire, each sect chooses a unique symbol based on the nature of their god. Followers of the Devourer might carry a shark&rsquo;s tooth or a piece of wood scorched in a wildfire. A Keeper cult might use the nine-sided coin of Kol Korran with the face disfigured. A particular sect uses these symbols consistently, if not obviously.</p>

<li>The Silver Flame is force of light that holds fiends at bay. Those who seek to defend the innocent from evil can draw on the power of the Flame.</li>
<li>Every mortal soul can find the light. Inspire and guide others to virtuous behavior; force is a last resort.</li>
<li>Listen to the Voice of the Flame; beware the deceiving whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every Thrane child knows the story of Tira Miron. Centuries ago, one of the ancient and powerful demons chained within the world broke free from its bonds, unleashing terrible suffering on the people of Thrane. The nation would have been destroyed if not for Tira Miron. This paladin was called by the Silver Flame and battled the mighty fiend. When it became clear that the overlord couldn&rsquo;t be destroyed, Tira gave her life, combining her spirit with the light of the Silver Flame to bind the demon once more. Now Tira serves as the Voice of the Flame, helping others find the light. Anyone who seeks to protect the innocent and battle evil can draw on the power of the Silver Flame to aid them, but they must beware of the Shadow in the Flame, the demon that still lingers and yearns to trick good people into evil.</p>

Now eleven years old, Jaela Daran continues to astound all who encounter her. She possesses poise and wisdom beyond her years, and she displays the blend of courage and compassion that is the cornerstone of the faith. As Keeper of the Flame, she wields tremendous divine power; she has summoned angels to her side and resurrected Cardinal Halidor after his assassination.</p>
<p>But some claim that these stories are fabrications and that Jaela is merely a figurehead for High Cardinal Krozen. The reclusive Krozen is a brilliant strategist and ruthless leader. Many believe that Krozen was behind the death of Keeper Tagor in 992 YK, suggesting that he supported the child Keeper to solidify his own influence. Is Krozen the true power behind the Flame?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pillar of argent fire marks the point of Tira&rsquo;s sacrifice, the center of the modern church. This pillar, located in Flamekeep, is a manifestation of the Silver Flame, not the source of its power.</p>
<p>The church&rsquo;s templars stand ready to protect the innocent from supernatural threats, battling undead, fiends, and aberrations. Friars and ministers fight evil by doing good, performing acts of compassion and charity across Khorvaire. In contrast to the Sovereign Host, the church maintains a defined structure and creed. Archbishops monitor regions; cardinals lead the church; and the ultimate authority is the Keeper of the Flame, who maintains the font in Flamekeep and communes with Tira Miron.</p>
<p>The Last War had a serious impact on the church. Leaders still respected the Keeper&rsquo;s authority over spiritual matters, but the war wasn&rsquo;t about good or evil. Templars of all nations still joined together to fight demons, but if no supernatural threat was present, they fought for their own nations. This division allowed cracks to form in the foundation. In Breland, some priests fell prey to greed or forged ties to criminal organizations. In Aundair, a zealous faction known as the Pure Flame advocates using violence rather than compassion as the primary tool for rooting out evil. And in Thrane, the church has become the ruling body. While still driven by Tira&rsquo;s principles of redemption and sacrifice, the intrusion of politics means that some come to the faith seeking power rather than purely to do good.</p>
<p>In creating a follower of the Silver Flame, decide whether you are bound to the church or simply inspired by its principles. As a paladin, are you part of the templar order, or were you a farmer called to action by the Voice of the Silver Flame?</p>
<p>The Silver Flame is centered in Thrane, but it has a strong presence in Breland and Aundair, and followers across Khorvaire. Members of the Pure Flame sect treat some speciesâ€”notably shifters and changelingsâ€”with suspicion, but the faith holds that people of all races should stand together.</p>

This terrorist organization has a new and unusual critic: Hask Malevanor, an &ldquo;abactor&rdquo; of the Blood of Vol and high priest of the Crimson Monastery, a temple in the city of Atur in Karrnath. Something else you should know about Abactor Malevanor: he&rsquo;s been dead for over fifty years! This putrid priest says that there&rsquo;s nothing unholy about his condition, swearing that his people revere all life. Despite the fact that the terrorists included priests from his church, Malevanor insists that his parishioners despise the Emerald Claw and harbor no hostility toward Breland.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;d like to take the abactor at his word, our research shows that Malevanor was personally involved in the program that produced the infamous Karrnathi undead soldiers. After decades of driving the Karrnathi war effort, this foul creature expects us to believe that he has nothing to do with the necromantic attacks on our people? Here at the <em>Voice of Breland</em>, we think something about this smells rotten, and it&rsquo;s not just the mummy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What just god would allow death and suffering? The Blood of Vol teaches that we all have the potential to become divine beingsâ€”and that death is a curse, designed to kill you before you can unlock the divinity within you.</p>
<p>The Blood of Vol is a grim faith, founded by Erandis d&rsquo;Vol, an elf from Aerenal. It asserts that death is oblivion, that the universe is uncaring, and that if the Sovereigns exist, they are cruel. Its followers study the secrets of blood and life, and because they believe that death is the end, they see nothing wrong with using the bodies of the fallen to serve the living. Seekers of the Divinity Within (as the faithful call themselves) are glad to be reanimated after death; at least they can do some good.</p>
<p>Because of this association with necromancy, many believe the Blood of Vol embraces death and its followers want to become undead. Both ideas are false. The Blood of Vol sees death as the ultimate evil. Seekers don&rsquo;t want to become undead; they want to become divine beings. The faith teaches that divinity is tied to blood and soul, and the undead can never fully harness that power. The mummies and vampires of the Blood of Vol have sacrificed their chance at divinity to guide the living. They&rsquo;re martyrs, not something to envy.</p>
<p>In addition to a general revulsion toward the undead, the public opinion of the Blood of Vol is colored by the actions of the Order of the Emerald Claw. This extremist sect serves a lich known as the Queen of Death, and it employs necromantic magic in acts of terror. However, most Seekers don&rsquo;t support the Emerald Claw.</p>
<p>The Blood of Vol has its strongest following in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities. For a time, it was the national religion of Karrnath. Though fallen from favor, the faith is still practiced openly in that nation.</p>

Acting on a tip from the Royal Eyes of Aundair, elite forces raided a House Vadalis facility and discovered a nightmare. Captain Allis says that her soldiers discovered a beating heart that filled an entire room, pumping blood through veins in the walls of the building. According to Allis, the staff claimed to be &ldquo;creating the heart of Galifar,&rdquo; apparently believing that if completed, this monstrosity could reunite the shattered kingdom.</p>
<p>When pressed to comment, Patriarch Dalin d&rsquo;Vadalis denied any connections to this cult. &ldquo;These are difficult times for all of us. I assure you that House Vadalis will conduct a full investigation of this incident and work to regain the trust of the good people of Fairhaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Cults of the Dragon Below are wildly diverse. The tenets above describe the beliefs of three different cults. Warlocks draw power from demon overlords, and daelkyr cultists serve mind flayers and beholders. Others embrace deep convictions that others see as madness. Outsiders use the term &ldquo;Cult of the Dragon Below&rdquo; as a blanket term to describe these disparate beliefs, but the cultists don&rsquo;t use this name or see themselves as part of a greater whole.</p>
<p>Cults of the Dragon Below are based on madness or power. A cult that seeks power chooses to serve a dark force because of the gifts they receive from it. A cabal of scholars might serve the demon overlord Sul Khatesh in exchange for secrets of magic. In the Mror Holds, dwarf clans bargain with Dyrrn the Corruptor to gain symbionts and sinister gifts. The Shadow Marches contain cults devoted to the daelkyr Belashyrra and Kyrzin. Membership in such a cult is voluntary, and spellcasters are more likely to be warlocks or wizards than clerics; their power comes from bargaining, not from faith.</p>
<p>Cults driven by madness have a warped view of reality. A cultist might believe aberrations are a higher form of life and that the daelkyr will elevate mortals. Other cultists may not recognize the true nature of the beings they serve. A cult of Rak Tulkhesh might truly believe their lord will bring peace to the world, even if that peace must begin with bloody war. Joining such a cult isn&rsquo;t a choice, it&rsquo;s something you fall into due to madness. New cults can spring up anywhere, as seeds of madness take root and spread.</p>
<p>Cults of the Dragon Below often appear as antagonists. However, your character could be a member of a relatively benign cult. You might have been raised in a cult but broke free from its influence. If your character was or is part of a cult, work with your DM to develop the details of your sect.</p>

<li>We live in an age of darkness. We must find the path that leads to the light.</li>
<li>Act with compassion and courage. Each noble act is a step on the path.</li>
<li>Hone your body and your mind. You are the tool you will use to change reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practiced by many kalashtar, the Path of Light seeks to change reality by first bringing change within, using meditation to focus the mind and athletic discipline to improve the body. The next step brings light into the world, using courage and compassion to banish the darkness in the people around you. Mediate disputes. Extinguish hatred by guiding people out of darkness. Inspire people to be better than they are. Even the smallest change is a victory, yet lightbringersâ€”the followers of this pathâ€”hope that this is merely a step on a greater journey.</p>
<p>The Path of Light teaches that this age is dominated by il-Lashtavar, &ldquo;the great darkness that dreams.&rdquo; This force poisons the world and promotes darkness. But all things change. If enough light can enter the world, it will lead to a tidal shift: the age of il-Lashtavar will end and usher in the time of il-Yannah, the great light.</p>
<p>Some followers of this faith believe that meditation alone is sufficient to change the path of the world, that merely contemplating the light is sufficient to bring about the change. Most believe that it is necessary to take action, but that darkness must fought with light. Violence is never the answer, and the only way to defeat evil is to redeem it. Lightbringers seek to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those whose evil is driven by ignorance. The faith has followed this path for over a thousand years, but now a splinter sect advocates greater action. These shadow watchers believe that evil must be fought, that sources of darkness that poison communities can and should be ruthlessly eliminated.</p>
<p>The Path of Light is taught to the kalashtar by the spirits bound to their bloodlines. It is widespread in the nation of Adar in distant Sarlona, but in Khorvaire, it is largely unknown outside kalashtar communities. The shadow watchers champion a sect born in Khorvaire, and the elders of Adar have condemned its methods.</p>
<p>If you follow the Path of Light, you must choose your side. As a lightbringer, you seek to spread hope and goodwill. As a shadow watcher, you hunt down and eliminate sources of darkness. Which path will you follow?</p>

The enlightened Havakhadâ€”that&rsquo;s what he calls himselfâ€”issued a warning that &ldquo;darkness was gathering&rdquo; and that &ldquo;a terrible time lies just ahead.&rdquo; He beseeched the assembled crowds to show kindness to neighbor and stranger alike, and not to let &ldquo;fear cause strife in the hard days to come.&rdquo; Apparently Havakhad hasn&rsquo;t heard the news that we&rsquo;re winning the war. But if the world does end tomorrow, you read it here first!</p>

<p>As a Tairnadal elf of Valenar, you were raised on the legends of your people, on tales of champions who battled mighty dragons and armies of giants. When you came of age, the Keepers of the Past read the signs to determine which of these ancestors chose you to be their vessel. Since that day, it has been your duty to emulate your patron ancestor. If you&rsquo;re a wizard, you&rsquo;ve studied the spells created by your ancestor. If you&rsquo;re a warrior, you&rsquo;ve practiced their specific martial techniques. When you trance, you relive their greatest battles. But these studies are just preparation. Now it&rsquo;s your sacred duty to be a revenant of your ancestor: to live your life as they did and allow the champion to walk the world again through you. (This title of revenant carried by Speakers of the Past is not to be confused with the undead revenants described in the Monster Manual.)</p>
<p>The bond between ancestor and living elf is holy. Your ancestor doesn&rsquo;t speak to you or control your actions. But as a Tairnadal, you believe that they are with youâ€”that your instincts and your reflexes are the ancestor moving through you, telling you what to do. The closer you follow the path, the more guidance they provide, helping you create new legends.</p>
<p>The folk of Khorvaire see your people as mercenaries and conquerors. But you don&rsquo;t care about gold or personal glory. All you want is to let your ancestors live again, and that means you need to perform deeds worthy of champions. That drives you now: seeking out adventures that will add to the legends of your patron.</p>
<p>You and your DM should develop the identity of your ancestor. How did they fight? What were some of their legendary deeds? Did they have a distinctive weapon or favor a particular kind of magic? Equally important is your relationship with the ancestor. Are you proud of your ancestor and excited to live as they did, or is your duty a burden?</p>
<p>Since the rise of Valenar, half-elves and even some humans have sought to be inducted into the faith. But so far the Keepers of the Past have declared that only elves can be revenants. Beyond the blood connection to the ancestor, an elf communes with their ancestor during trance, and half-elves can&rsquo;t enter this state. The Keepers say it can&rsquo;t be done, but perhaps you&rsquo;ll be the one to prove them wrong.</p>

<li>Our greatest champions and sages will never be lost to us. Their wisdom guides us, and their power protects us all.</li>
<li>Honor our past. Respect our traditions. Perfect your skills and you may earn your place among the Deathless.</li>
<li>Destroy those foul creatures that channel the power of Mabar, for they consume the essence of our world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The elves of Aerenal refuse to let their greatest souls be lost to the oblivion that is Dolurrh. The wisest and most accomplished elves are preserved after death, becoming members of the Undying Court. The devotion of the living elves sustains the Undying Court, and the Court generates a well of mystic energy that empowers their clerics. As an Aereni cleric, your spells aren&rsquo;t personally granted to you by a specific Undying Councilor. Your powers flow from the Court itself, allowing you to serve its will and to protect your people.</p>
<p>Of all the religions of Eberron, the Undying Court is most grounded in the world. The Court stands in the city of Shae Mordai, and as an Aerenal elf, you could seek an audience with one of your deathless ancestors. As a devotee of the Undying Court, you recognize it as the power that sustains your civilization and as an assembly of your greatest sages and leaders. Should you accomplish great achievements in your life, you can aspire to join the Court.</p>
<p>As a cleric or paladin of the Undying Court, you have a concrete relationship with your deity. In creating your character, consider why you&rsquo;ve traveled so far from home. Are you on a specific mission? Are you serving the Court as a whole, or are you acting as an agent of a specific councilorâ€”perhaps your own ancestor? The Undying Court despises undead creatures that prey on the living, so if you don&rsquo;t have a concrete mission, you can always hunt down undead and evil necromancers.</p>

This experience affirms the place of the individual as part of the greater whole.</p>
<p>Since trance communion is a personal experience, the role of the priest is to provide spiritual and practical guidance to their congregation. A masked priest serves as the face of the Court, and any elf can approach them seeking an ease to their burdens.</p>

The Great Druid is a figure of legend, a powerful mystic who serves as the spiritual leader of a diverse range of druids spread across the region. Another interesting fact about Oalian? He&rsquo;s a tree! Some say he&rsquo;s a child of Eberron herself, while others assert that he&rsquo;s the spirit of an ancient druid trapped in tree form. Whatever the truth, the Great Druid Oalian appears as a massive greatpine in a grove called Greenheart, deep in the Towering Wood.</p>

<p>All druids look after the natural world, but they act in different ways. Five well-established paths define most of Khorvaire&rsquo;s druids. In creating a druid character, consider whether you have ties to one of these traditions, and what led you to leave your order. Are you on a mission? Are you exploring the world? Have you been banished, with good reason or otherwise?</p>

As a warden, you help others understand nature, ensuring that they don&rsquo;t cause unintentional harm or stumble into danger. Wardens serve as militia and mediators in the Eldeen Reaches. This is the largest of the druidic sects and the most recognized.y a decade old. The treaty nations refuse to acknowledge its sovereignty; according to the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, it&rsquo;s a rebellious territory of Breland. As a renegade nation, it is a haven for war criminals and deserters, as well as brigands and mages pursuing forbidden paths of magic. The monsters of Droaam have no particular love for these bandits and fugitives, and outlanders have to watch their step.</p>
<p>Tensions remain high on the border with Breland, resulting in constant skirmishes and raids. Deeper within the nation, the Daughters of Sora Kell build their power. Graywall and the Great Crag are constantly expanding, with goblins and ogres laboring through the night. Warlords drill their troops, forcing all manner of monsters to work together. A predatory aspect permeates life in Droaam but also a sense of excitement, the belief that the Daughters will lead Droaam to greatness. For centuries the people of Droaam have hidden in the shadows; now they stand in the light, and they are proud.</p>

<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Agriculture, animal husbandry, druidic magic</p>
<p>A stretch of fertile farmlands borders a vast, untamed forest. Farmers tend the fields, while tribes of shifters and circles of druids and rangers roam through the woods. These are the Eldeen Reaches.</p>
<p>Druids and shifters dwelled in the Towering Wood for thousands of years, but the eastern farmlands of the Reaches were part of Aundair until the Last War. The lords of Aundair focused their resources on the war effort, ignoring banditry and other problems faced by the farmers of the east. The Wardens of the Woodâ€”largest of the druid sectsâ€”came to the aid of these farmers. Fifty years ago, the people of eastern Aundair seceded and formed the Eldeen Reaches. The Treaty of Thronehold recognized the Reaches as a nation, but its citizens fear Aundair will try to reclaim the region.</p>
<p>Druidic magic is central to life in the Eldeen Reaches. Its people seek to live in harmony with the natural world, and each community has a druidic advisor who helps with planning and planting. The Towering Wood is also home to tribes of shifters, who maintain a nomadic existence. The Wardens of the Wood uphold order and settle disputes, and the Great Druid Oalianâ€”an awakened greatpineâ€”is the spiritual leader of the Reaches.</p>

<li>The Towering Wood is vast and untamed. The Wardens of the Wood seek to protect travelers, but swathes of forest remain entirely untouched by human or shifter. Such areas could hold giant beasts never seen in the outside world, or relics from a previous ageâ€”artifacts or ruins created by demons or the terrifying daelkyr.</li>
<li>The fey have a strong presence in the Towering Wood. Even outside the fey stronghold of the Twilight Demesne, manifest zones tied to Thelanis (see chapter 4) allow passage between worlds. The Eldeen Reaches are a logical origin for a character with ties to the fey.</li>
<li>Druidic magic is a vital tool in the Eldeen Reaches. Residents use animal messengers to carry communications between villages, and beasts perform vital services. <wc-fetch type=spell>Goodberry</wc-fetch> wine takes the place of House Vadalis healing. Communities include awakened animals and plants as members.</li>

<p><strong>Farm or Forest</strong>? Did you grow up on one of the farms of the eastern Reaches, or did you spend your childhood in the Towering Wood? Are you comfortable in buildings, or do you prefer the open air? As a child of the forest, you might take the outlander background, or perhaps you became a folk hero by defending farmers from bandits and beasts.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Magic</strong>. Druidic traditions play an important role in Eldeen society. If you&rsquo;re a druid or ranger, are you a stoic Warden of the Wood or a grim Child of Winter? Even if you&rsquo;re not a spellcaster, the Magic Initiate feat can provide you with a few spells to reflect a basic initiation into the druidic mysteries.</p>
<p><strong>A Land with No Lords.</strong> The Reachers are fiercely independent. They broke with Aundair, and they bow to no monarch. The folk of the Reaches value talent over titles. The Eldeen people respect the guidance of the druids, but they all work together to solve their problems; no one gives orders to a Reacher.</p>

<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Ale, dairy, glass, livestock, lumber, martial discipline, paper, textiles, undead</p>
<p>In a nation of storms and long winters, the grim and stoic Karrns are accustomed to enduring hardship without complaint.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Karrnath is known for its military tradition. Strength, strategy, and discipline are the core values of Karrnath. Karrnath&rsquo;s soldiers might be the finest in Khorvaire, but they lack the magical support of Aundair or Thrane, which evened the odds during the Last War. Nonetheless, Karrns are proud of their martial history, and most are convinced that they would have eventually won the Last War.</p>
<p>Karrnath suffered a series of severe food shortages and plagues early in the Last War. As a result, the king embraced the Blood of Vol as the national religion. The priests of this faith bolstered Karrnath&rsquo;s forces with undead. The current king, Kaius ir&rsquo;Wynarn III, broke ties with the Blood of Vol and has stopped creating new undead, but Karrnath still has a significant number of skeletons and zombies in service. Many Karrns still believe in the Blood of Vol and approve of the use of undead, but just as many feel that this practice disgraces Karrnath&rsquo;s proud military history and that the necromancers might have been responsible for the famines and plagues.</p>

His guardians kept him hidden during his youth while his aunt Moranna served as the regent of Karrnath. So it was a surprise to many when he burst forth to claim his crown and his power, all the more so because of his uncanny resemblance to Kaius I, the ruler who plunged Karrnath into the Last War and instituted the brutal system of laws that bears his name.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances of Kaius III&rsquo;s ascension, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that the new king would face challenges from the proud warlords of Karrnath. Some questioned his lineage and his ability to command. But the most unusual challenge came from the warlord Drago Thul: was Kaius III actually alive? Kaius I had elevated the Blood of Vol in Karrnath and instituted the use of undead as weapons of war. Drago Thul asserted that Kaius III was actually Kaius I, a vampiric monster &ldquo;seeking to drain the lifeblood of Karrnath itself.&rdquo; This was a serious accusation; the undead have no rights under the Code of Galifar and cannot inherit titles or lands. Thul&rsquo;s challenge spread like wildfire, only to be crushed when Kaius III met the warlords under the midday sun and cut his palm to show his freely flowing blood.</p>
<p>This should have been the end of it, but the tale of the Vampire King has proven surprisingly resilient. Some say that the king developed special enchantments to avoid the effects of sunlight; others say that he has relies on changeling impersonators to take his place in the daylight. As for Drago Thul, he refused to stand down when Kaius III pushed for peace and the Treaty of Thronehold. He fled to the city of Stormreach in Xen&rsquo;drik with a small band of followers, and he continues to rally support against &ldquo;the monster that sits on our throne.&rdquo;</p>

<li>The Sovereign Host has regained its place as the dominant religion of Karrnath, but the Blood of Vol retains a strong following. Communities that practice the faith still use skeletons and zombies as guards or laborers.</li>

As you develop a Karrnathi character or NPC, consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>Military Service</strong>. Karrns have a strong tradition of military service, making soldier or sailor appropriate backgrounds for any character. Criminals and charlatans have a difficult time evading the harsh laws of Karrnath. The <wc-fetch type=feat>Martial Adept</wc-fetch> feat can give a character a strong sense of military experience.</p>
<p><strong>Martial Tradition</strong>. Karrnathi tradition emphasizes teamwork, focus, and force, and melee warriors prefer heavy armor and weapons. Fighters favor the Champion and Battle Master martial archetypes, and Karrnathi wizards choose the School of Evocation or Necromancy as their arcane tradition.</p>
<p><strong>The Dead</strong>. Undead soldiers have served in Karrnath&rsquo;s armies for decades. How do you feel about the undead? Are you a follower of the Blood of Vol who considers the undead to be a practical tool? Do you have a relative or friend currently serving? Or do you despise the Blood of Vol and the use of necromancy?</p>

Early in the war, King Kaius I instituted the Code of Kaius, a strict set of laws and limits. Karrnath weathered a number of famines during the war, and this privation led to an ongoing program of rationing to ensure that the nation is prepared for whatever lies ahead. The war is over, but the Code of Kaius and the rationing remains in place; the people of Karrnath willingly endure ongoing hardship to ensure that their future is secure. The populace frowns on excess of any sort, accepts limits on luxury items, and approves of swift and harsh punishments for crime.</p>
<p>King Kaius III was one of the architects of the Treaty of Thronehold and remains committed to peace. However, many of the nation&rsquo;s warlords believe that Karrnath would have won the Last War and that Kaius denied the Karrnathi people their rightful destiny. Should these warlords gain sufficient support, they could push for a military coup.</p>
<p>A second destabilizing factor is the tension between the followers of the Blood of Vol and the Karrnathi traditionalists. The Seekers assert that the Blood of Vol saved Karrnath and point to the power of its undead troops. The traditionalists claim that the dark magic of the Seekers caused famines and plagues, crippling Karrnath and forcing it to rely on the undead.

<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Fish, mercenaries, merchants, pirates, ships</p>
<p>This loose confederacy of pirate lords, merchant princes, and sea barons holds the northeastern coastline of Khorvaire and the many mist-shrouded islands scattered across it. Recognized as a single allied nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, the principalities are more of a loose alliance. Each island domain has its own values, goals, and feuds with other domains. The Lhazaar are the finest sailors in Khorvaire. During the Last War, they served all nations as privateers and engaged in piracy on the side. When the war ended, they returned to the merchant trade, but pirates still hunt on the open seas.</p>
<p>The Lhazaar value their independence. Here, anyone can rise to captain a ship or even seize a principality. Leadership is earned, not given. Nevertheless, High Prince Ryger ir&rsquo;Wynarn of Regalport seeks to forge the principalities into a unified force. He has the finest fleet, and his efforts ensured that the principalities gained recognition at Thronehold, after which he awarded himself the title of High Prince. So far, the other princes have rejected his proposals for a stronger union.</p>
<p>Some principalities are devoted to the Blood of Vol and a few favor the Sovereign Host. Beyond these, the Lhazaar show little enthusiasm for religion, though many curse the Devourer when a storm comes.</p>

<li>Rulership of the principalities is so fluid that it&rsquo;s possible for someone to start the day as a sailor and end it as a prince. A campaign could easily be based around a party of adventurers gaining a principality.</li>
<li>The Wind Whisperer principality includes a number of half-elves with the Mark of Stormâ€”foundlings with no tie to House Lyrandar. The Wind Whisperers want to obtain airships by any means necessary.</li>
<li>The Lhazaar Principalities have the largest changeling population in Khorvaire. Many of them congregate in the Gray Tide, a domain founded by changelings.</li>

<p><strong>Seafarers and Swashbucklers</strong>. Most Lhazaar spend more time at sea than they do on land. Sailor is an appropriate background for any Lhazaar, but you can ask your DM if you can switch a tool proficiency for vehicles (water) proficiency. Lhazaar are flamboyant people with little concern for the law, so charlatan, entertainer, and folk hero are all appropriate backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>Local Customs</strong>. Each principality has its own martial traditions, fashions, and slang. Think about how your choices reflect your principality and work with your DM to develop one that fits your character.</p>
<p><strong>Big Dreams</strong>. Whatever their circumstances, the people of the principalities always look to the future. What do you want? To find a forgotten treasure hoard? To command your own ship? To take your place as a prince? Think big and chase your dreams.</p>

<p>Most of the princes are content with their domains, but ambitious rulers such as Prince Ryger of Regalport and Prince Kolberkon of Port Verge could shatter the status quo. Kolberkon seeks to expand his personal power, while Ryger wants to forge a stronger unified nation. Both pursue dangerous alliances in their campaigns. In addition to agreements with the dragonmarked houses, rumors abound of bargains with dragons, fiends, and the distant Empire of Riedra. Will the dreams of these princes lead to a new war?</p>

<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Banking, dwarves, metalwork, mining (precious and non-precious metals)</p>
<p>When humanity first came to Khorvaire, they found the dwarven clans of the Mror Holds locked in endless feuds. This division kept the clans from uniting against the new arrivals, and the dwarves were forced to swear fealty to Karrnath and Galifar. Over the centuries, they turned their energies to harnessing the astonishing natural resources of their mountain home. The dwarves were then reborn as merchant lords.</p>

</p>
<p>In the early days of the Last War, Mror miners made an astonishing discovery: the ruins of an ancient dwarven empire, vast halls deep within the Ironroot Mountains. Explorers uncovered mines still brimming with jewels and precious ores and vaults filled with riches and powerful artifacts. The Mror restored these ancient fortresses and worked to reclaim the secrets of their ancestors. Seeing the untapped potential of the Realm Below and the broken Kingdom of Galifar, the clan lords joined together to form the Iron Council and to declare the independence and sovereignty of the Mror Holds.</p>
<p>One question remained: What had become of the ancient dwarves? The answer soon became apparent. As the Mror delved deeper into the Realm Below, they woke an ancient evil: Dyrrn the Corruptor, a daelkyr lord of madness. Hordes of aberrations and derro rose from the depths to challenge the explorers. For decades, the Mror lords have been fighting a battle in the depths, struggling to drive the darkness from their ancestral halls. Many dwarves revile anything to do with the daelkyr. Others believe that the daelkyr can grant the Mror dwarves the power to overcome any enemy. Some clans have taken up symbionts and living weapons recovered from the depths, and cabals of warlocks draw on the power of the Plane of Xoriat (see chapter 4).</p>
<p>The Mror Holds consist of a loose confederation. Twelve noble clans each govern a hold and have a representative on the Iron Council, which resolves disputes and issues affecting the entire nation. Each hold includes a number of lesser clans, who owe fealty to the noble line. Those who occupy land above have the right to claim the halls that lie below if they can.</p>
<p>The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of the Mror Holds. Kol Korran is the most beloved of the Sovereigns, but the dwarves also revere Boldrei, Dol Dorn, Olladra, and Onatar.</p>

<li>The Mror Holds contain deep reserves of gold, silver, and other rare and precious metals, along with iron and other ores. The Mror dwarves are skilled miners and artisans.</li>
<li>A clan of orcs called the Jhorash&rsquo;tar live among the Ironroot Mountains. The Jhorash&rsquo;tar have been slowly crowded into the least hospitable regions of the mountains. A few dwarven clans seek to incorporate the Jhorash&rsquo;tar into Mror society, but others wish to drive them out once and for all.</li>
<li>The dwarves have recovered artifacts and arcane secrets from the Realm Below. Dwarf artificers are still working to master the techniques of their ancestors, while warlocks strive to harness the powers of the daelkyr. Mror communities are shaped by the artifacts they possess or by their interactions with the daelkyr. A Mror lord might serve guests from a bottomless cauldron of wine, while another studies strangers using a crown of eyes, claiming that this living artifact reveals all evil intent.</li>

<p><strong>Clan Focus</strong>. The dwarf clan is the heart of Mror culture. Is your clan known for mercantile power or martial skill? Are you a nobleâ€”even if you&rsquo;re a few steps removed from true power? Or are you a guild artisan or soldier? Most Mror have embraced modern martial techniques, but a few minor clans still cling to barbarian traditions of the past. What caused you to leave your hold? Are you serving your clan and honing your skills, or have you been exiled from your homeland?</p>
<p><strong>The Realm Below</strong>. How has the Realm Below affected your family and your character? Do you oppose the foul forces that infest your ancestral halls, or do you see them as a source of power? You might be a paladin sworn to oppose the horrors that dwell in the deep, or you could be a warlock who&rsquo;s forged a pact with a Great Old One patron, one of the dark powers in the depths.</p>
<p><strong>Pride in Possessions</strong>. From the wealthiest clan lord to the humblest miner, the Mror take great pride in their possessions. Quality is more important than appearance, and you are interested in the history of the items you carry. If you find a magic weapon, you want to know the battles it has seen and the warriors who have wielded it before you. This is especially true of the relics recovered from the Realm Below. Who forged the blade you carry? Do you bear a trinket from a forgotten age?</p>

King Kaius II was newly seated on the steel throne and lacked the resolve to bring the dwarf lords to heel. Now we see the harvest we have sown, and it is horrifying. Without the firm hand of Karrnath to keep them on a righteous path, the Mror dwarves have embraced foul powers.</p>
<p>Witness Lord Malus Soldorak, seen in Korth this week for trade negotiations. His breastplate was forged from chitin and muscle, and it seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat. A guard present at the event said that Soldorak&rsquo;s axe moaned when the blade came close to him, as if the weapon hungered for human blood.</p>
<p>This is what springs from our mercy and forbearance. Who knows what horrors the dwarves are craftingâ€”or breedingâ€”in their mountain halls? We cannot stand by and let this vileness continue. For the good of our nation, we call on all true Karrns to demand that Regent Moranna unleash our full might on the Mror Holds and cleanse this horror!</p>

Many nations depend on the resource of the Holds, and the Treaty of Thronehold affirmed its sovereignty.</p>
<p>To the casual observer, the Mror dwarves' star appears to be rising. Their mines seem to offer limitless resources. Mror artificers make amazing strides as they study the relics of their ancestors. The dwarves are proud of their ancient past and optimistic about the future. Most Mror are generous and courageous, eager to show off their wealth and accomplishments.</p>
<p>Those who dig deeper realize that this prosperity is built on an unstable foundation. The Last War may be over, but the war against the daelkyr has barely begun. The clan lords hold their reclaimed halls in the Realm Below, but no one knows the full extent of the power of the daelkyr. A renewed assault could come at any time, whether it&rsquo;s a force of monsters boiling up from below or a creeping madness that infects the weak-willed.</p>
<p>The dwarves are also divided by their attitude toward the aberrations. Some of the clansâ€”notably Soldorakâ€”embrace symbionts and other daelkyr gifts; some even experiment with flesh-warping techniques and create their own monsters. Othersâ€”notably Clan Mroranonâ€”avoid contact with the aberrations. Such dwarves treasure the relics of their ancestors but despise those who use symbionts or form pacts with the darkness.</p>
<p>Long ago, the dwarves engaged in vicious feuds that kept them from uniting as a nation. This new divide could reignite those rivalries, leading to a civil war on the surface even as evil gains strength in the depths.</p>

<p>Q&rsquo;barra is a young nation on the edge of Khorvaire, an untamed frontier filled with danger and opportunity. During the golden age of Galifar, few humans bothered to cross the Endworld Mountains to explore the vast jungle beyond. When the Last War broke out, a fleet of settlers came to Q&rsquo;barra in search of a new home far from the war. As this settlement expanded, the settlers discovered massive deposits of Eberron dragonshards (see chapter 5). Over the past decade, a wave of prospectors, wandslingers, refugees, and fortune-seekers have descended on Q&rsquo;barra, along with brigands, deserters from the war, and all manner of criminals and opportunists.</p>
<p>To their surprise, Q&rsquo;barra was already home to a number of ancient civilizations humans know nothing about: the lizardfolk of the Cold Sun Federation, the dragonborn of Ka&rsquo;rhashan, and the confederacy of the Poison Dusk lizardfolk. Most settlers refer to them collectively as &ldquo;scales.&rdquo; King Sebastes ir&rsquo;Kesslan of Newthrone has established a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, but communication has been difficult and prospectors rarely abide by the terms of the treaty.</p>

Settlers, dragonborn, and lizardfolk characters who originate here should consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>Settlers</strong>. Q&rsquo;barra is an excellent place to explore the traditional archetypes of the classic Western. As a paladin, you could be a lone sheriff seeking to protect your newly formed mining village. Your cleric could be the town preacher. As a sorcerer or bard with a criminal background, you could be a dashing wandslinger looking for trouble and gold.</p>
<p><strong>Renegades and Regrets</strong>. Q&rsquo;barra promises a land of opportunity and a place where you can leave your past behind. Are you a deserter? Were you convicted of a crime you didn&rsquo;t commit? Are you fleeing from a broken heart? Q&rsquo;barra has also drawn Cyran refugees and newly freed warforged, both seeking a home in the wild east.</p>
<p><strong>Lizardfolk</strong>. The lizardfolk&rsquo;s primitive culture blends druidic traditions with the beliefs of the Silver Flame. You might have been sent to study the softskinsâ€”to learn about them and potentially serve as an envoy for your people. Alternatively, you could be following a spiritual vision.</p>
<p><strong>Dragonborn</strong>. The dragonborn live amid the remnants of ancient glory. They have a proud martial tradition, and a number of dragonborn venture west in search of worthy challenges. If you follow this path, you might have served as a mercenary in the Last War.</p>

These &ldquo;Mourners&rdquo; rob and kill settlers from the nations that fought against Cyre. Hope also has its share of brigands and criminals, bandits who prey on House Tharashk convoys and settlers alike.</p>
<p>The relationship between the settlers and the natives is another source of tension. Although King Sebastes forged a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, the prospectors of Hope regularly violate this treaty. The Poison Dusk lizardfolk are hostile to both the settlers and the Cold Sun Federation. Conflicts between settlers and scales have escalated over the last four years, and many fear that worse is yet to come.</p>

<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Eberron dragonshards, herbs</p>
<p>When most people think of the Shadow Marches, they imagine a fetid backwater where illiterate humans mingle with orcs and other foul creatures, practicing strange rites by the light of the moons. While flawed, this vision isn&rsquo;t entirely inaccurate. The Shadow Marches are a desolate land of swamps and moors. The homeland of the orcs, the Marches were scarred in the ancient conflict with the daelkyr. The fiends left twisted creatures and aberrations in the swamps, and sowed seeds of madness that linger to this day. There are indeed moonlit rituals in the Marches: some to honor the daelkyr, others to maintain the wards that keep them trapped in Khyber.</p>
<p>Humans came to the Marches long ago, refugees fleeing a war in the distant land of Sarlona. Over time the two cultures merged, forming the Marches as they exist today.</p>
<p>The Marches had little contact with the Kingdom of Galifar or the east until a few hundred years ago, when a House Sivis expedition made two discoveries: the region contained valuable dragonshards, and a number of clans had manifested the Dragonmark of Finding. This led to the foundation of House Tharashk, as these clans joined together to master the economic potential of their mark and leverage their mineral wealth.</p>
<p>The Shadow Marches aren&rsquo;t a nation. No one voice speaks for the clans and tribes, and most of the tribes have no interest in dealing with outsiders. House Tharashk is the largest faction in the region, and their city of Zarash&rsquo;ak is the center for commerce.</p>
<p>House Tharashk is the main point of contact between the Shadow Marches and the outside world. Tharashk aside, the region remains a collection of tribes and cultists following their ancient traditions in the shadows of the swamps.</p>

<li>The untamed Shadow Marches are filled with mysteries. Relics of the daelkyr rest undisturbed in the depths of the swamps, along with foul monsters and druidic shrines.</li>
<li>The Marches are the birthplace of the druidic tradition of the Gatekeepers. Long ago, this sect defeated the vile daelkyr; today, its last champions continue to protect Eberron from aberrations and other extraplanar threats.</li>
<li>Even in defeat, the daelkyr sowed seeds of madness in the Marches. Followers of the Cults of the Dragon Below remain scattered across the region. Some of these cults work with mind flayers and other aberrations. Others have no evil intent but are driven by dangerous delusions.</li>

<p><strong>The Mark of Finding.</strong> An alliance of Marcher clans formed House Tharashk, but not all those who carried the mark chose to join this house. As a half-orc with the Mark of Finding, you could be a child of the Marches with a strong tie to the house, or you could be a scion of a small tribe of hunters, proud of your independence and suspicious of the houses. Your ties to the Marches might be distant because you were born to a family that left years ago. Do you want to rediscover your ancestral roots?</p>
<p><strong>Madness and Mysticism</strong>. Most Marchers have a mystical view of the world, beliefs shaped by the traditions of the Gatekeepers and the madness of the daelkyr. Marchers typically feel that the people of the treaty nations are <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch> by their civilized ways. You have heard the truth in the voices of croaking frogs and seen it in the shadows shifting on the water. Whether you&rsquo;re loyal to the Gatekeepers, the Sovereign Host, or the Dragon Below, superstitions inform your path.</p>
<p><strong>Clan or Tribe</strong>? The people of the Shadow Marches are split into two distinct cultures. The clans blend the traditions of human and orc, building towns and working with steel. If you were raised in one of the clans, the ways of civilization aren&rsquo;t that strange to you; you&rsquo;ve seen the city of Zarash&rsquo;ak and worked with House Tharashk. By contrast, the Marcher tribes maintain traditions that predate humanity. As nomadic hunter-gatherers, they don&rsquo;t work metals; they make their tools from stone, hide, wood, and bone. If your character is from one of the Marcher tribes, you might be the first of your people to leave the swamps. Why have you left your people, and how are you adapting to this new world?</p>

The Shadow Marches contain many manifest zones tied to Xoriat and Kythri (see chapter 4 for descriptions of both), the planes of madness and chaos. Time moves strangely in places in the deep swamps, which twists mundane beasts and plants into strange shapes. Daelkyr ruins linger in these areas, remnants of the ancient war against the goblins and orcs that once dominated Khorvaire.</p>

House Tharashk oversees the City of Stilts, but Marcher clans and tribes come here to sell crafts and other goods or to celebrate religious rituals.</p>

Most Marchers have little interest in the outside world. Marcher tribes don&rsquo;t know the names or number of the nations beyond the swamps, let alone that they were at war. However, as House Tharashk gains power and influence in the world beyond the swamps, it has increased its presence in its homeland. The house has expanded Zarash&rsquo;ak dramatically over the last decade and is working on transforming other towns into cities. This has caused tension with a number of tribes. And House Tharashk&rsquo;s mining operations and its urban expansion always run the risk of disrupting Gatekeeper seals and unleashing ancient evils bound beneath the Marches.</p>

<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Dinosaurs, halflings, livestock</p>
<p>The halflings of the Talenta Plains have no cities and no industrialized magic, but they do have dinosaurs. The halflings domesticated the dinosaurs of the plains and use these creatures as mounts, livestock, and beasts of burden. A sacred bond exists between a hunter and mount, and few people are prepared to face a raging halfling barbarian riding a furious clawfoot raptor.</p>
<p>Talenta religion reveres spirits, both departed ancestors and natural spirits. Each tribe has a lathâ€”a chieftain who guides the tribeâ€”and shamans who consult the spirits and choose the paths of migration.</p>
<p>In the past, the tribes stood alone, but during the Last War, many halflings came together under Lathon Halpum to defend their land. Halpum won recognition for the Plains as one of the Thronehold nations, though it&rsquo;s still unclear what this means beyond increasing passage between the Plains and the outside world.</p>

<li>House Ghallanda and House Jorasco both originated in the Talenta Plains. The dragonmarked bloodlines appear throughout the tribes, though you can play a dragonmarked halfling from the Plains who doesn&rsquo;t work for the houses.</li>
<li>The Talentan reverence for spirits derives from the fact that a variety of spirits haunt the Plains. The region contains an unusual number of manifest zones tied to Dolurrh and Thelanis (see chapter 4 for descriptions of both). Ghosts are more likely to linger in such places, and minor fey are scattered across the Plains.</li>
<li>Stories tell of ancient ruins that date back to the first age of the world and of a vast graveyard holding the bones of dragons.</li>

Also consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>Wild Warriors and Tricksters.</strong> You were born in the wild, and your wits and your weapons helped you survive. Talenta warriors are often barbarians or rangers, relying on speed and skill. Outlander is a logical background, but you could easily be a folk hero, entertainer, or charlatan. You could even be an urchin who was stranded in a great city and adapted to life there.</p>
<p><strong>Surrounded by Spirits</strong>. Fey, fiends, and the ghosts of ancestors, these are all part of the spirit world, and they&rsquo;re all around you. Do you believe that the spirits guide your actions? Do you show respect to the spirits of a location? Talentan shamans tend to be druids of the Circle of the Moon or the Circle of the Shepherd (from Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything), often assuming the form of dinosaurs. You could also reflect a strong bond to spirits by playing a warlock with an Archfey patron, a cleric with the Nature domain, a paladin sworn to the Oath of the Ancients, or a barbarian on the Path of the Totem Warrior or Path of the Ancestral Guardian (from Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything). Hermit and outlander are natural backgrounds, but you could be an acolyte or a sage who consults spirits instead of books. Warriors and shamans both wear masks to present a particular face to the spirit world.</p>
<p><strong>Dinosaurs</strong>. Talenta halflings have a close bond to their dinosaur companions. If you don&rsquo;t begin the campaign with a dinosaur mount or companion, you might acquire one over the course of your adventures. You can also consider whether a fallen dinosaur is part of your backstory; perhaps you lost your faithful mount in the Last War, but you believe its spirit is still with you.</p>

The nomadic halflings have little interest in building towns; most shelter in the Talenta Plains is temporary.

House Ghallanda maintains the town, but Gatherhold belongs to the people, not the houses. Other dragonmarked houses offer their services here as well. The town is on the shore of Lake Cyre, and once people came by boat through Cyre; now the Mourning has cut off that passage.</p>

Now that the war is over, most of the tribes have returned to their hunting grounds and ancient traditions. They united to defend their way of life, and now they wish to enjoy it.</p>
<p>But the halflings don&rsquo;t yet know if it&rsquo;s possible to return to the previous ways. More foreigners visit the Plains than at any time in the past. Settlers and merchants cross the Plains as they make their way to Q&rsquo;barra, and they clash with Q&rsquo;barran bandits. The Valenar elves ride through the Plains in search of adventure. Monsters emerge from the Mournland. Dragonmarked houses seek to expand their role at Gatherhold and to explore the untapped resources of the Plains.</p>
<p>The halflings have no interest in change, but it might be inevitable. Lathon Halpum believes that if the tribes can work together, they could become a nation of nations, but others aggressively oppose such a path. Holy Uldra is a powerful shaman and the leader of her own tribe. She urges halfling warriors to join together for a single purpose: to drive all outsiders from the Plains and to maintain the ancient traditions. The halflings must decide whether the tribes will choose the path of peace or return to war.</p>

I think that&rsquo;s why my editor sent me to Flamekeep to cover the Ascension; surely I&rsquo;d see clearly, with eyes untouched by faith. I thought so, too. But then I found myself in the Chamber of Tira&rsquo;s Sacrifice, a pillar of silver fire marking the spot where one woman gave her life to protect countless innocents. I saw people from all nations joined together in song, celebrating both that ancient sacrifice and the end of our current war. And looking into the innocent eyes of the child priestess, I truly heard the words of that song for the first time: a call for all of us to be better than we are, to protect those in need, to remember that we are all one people in the light of the Silver Flame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The modern Church of the Silver Flame was founded in Thrane, and most of the people of the nation follow this faith. During the Last War, the people of Thrane chose to set aside the rule of the monarchy and to embrace the leadership of the church. For the last seventy years, Thrane has been a theocracy. The head of the state is 11-year-old Jaela Daran, the divinely selected Keeper of the Flame. Jaela depends on the Council of Cardinals to perform the practical work of running the nation.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Silver Flame is to defend the innocent from supernatural evil. The church has always had a militant aspect, with battalions of templars and peasant militias prepared to face undead, lycanthropes, or other monstrous threats. But compassion and charity are core values of the church, and the templars are tasked to defend all innocents. Even during the Last War, if a fiendish threat arose in a Brelish village, Thrane templars would ally with the locals to bring an end to the threat. Not all Thranes rise to this ideal. Zealous Thranes believe the church is destined to reunite Galifar under the Silver Flame, and corrupt priests are interested only in power and wealth.</p>
<p>Not all priests are clerics, and the typical templar is a mundane warrior. However, due to the deep faith of its people, Thrane produces more clerics and paladins than any other nation in Khorvaire.</p>

<li>Faith is part of daily life in Thrane, and divine adepts provide important services. Magic is also common in Thrane. <em>Everbright lanterns</em> light the streets while magewrights and wizards practice their trades, though there are fewer of them than in other nations.</li>
<li>Every town has a militia ready to deal with supernatural threats, and people stand together to fight darkness. Champions of the light find support and hospitality, but any character who dabbles with dark forcesâ€”necromancers, warlocks, and the likeâ€”finds Thrane a dangerous, unwelcoming place.</li>
<li>The feudal system of nobility remains in place, but ultimate authority rests in the hands of the church. Queen Diani ir&rsquo;Wynarn is the &ldquo;blood regent,&rdquo; serving as a symbolic advisor to the Keeper of the Flame. A small fraction of the population would like to see the traditional monarchy restored to power.</li>

<p><strong>The Impact of Faith.</strong> If you want to reflect a close bond to the Silver Flame, you could gain a few divine spells by taking the Magic Initiate feat. Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, so as a martial Thrane you might focus on archery-related combat styles or take the Sharpshooter feat. Any Thrane could take the acolyte background to reflect a strong connection to the church or the soldier background based on service with the templars.</p>
<p><strong>Church or Crown</strong>? Do you support the theocracy, or would you like to see power restored to the throne? Many people of faith believe that miring the church in politics distracts it and invites corruption.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with Darkness</strong>. The Shadow in the Flame can tempt even the most virtuous soul. How do you react when you encounter corruption and greed? Are you a compassionate person who seeks to lead people to the light, or a zealot determined to crush all darkness?</p>

Larger towns maintain sturdy walls patrolled by skilled archers. A Flamic architectural style appears throughout the region. Buildings incorporate light and soaring spaces, and icons of the Silver Flame and images of the martyr Tira Miron appear throughout the nation.</p>
<h4 id=flamekeep>
<a href=#flamekeep class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Flamekeep</h4><p>The spiritual heart and capital of Thrane, Flamekeep is a massive fortress city. The Keeper of the Flame dwells in the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame, which holds the pillar of fire born when Tira Miron sacrificed herself to bind the demon Bel Shalor. The cathedral is the seat of the Council of Cardinals and the primary garrison of the templar order. Flamekeep is also home to Thalingard, the ancestral palace of the rulers of Thrane and current residence of Queen Diani ir&rsquo;Wynarn.</p>
<h4 id=shadukar>
<a href=#shadukar class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Shadukar</h4><p>Shadukar is a grim reminder of the cost of the war. Once known as the Jewel of the Sound, this coastal city was destroyed in a bitter siege against Karrnathi forces. The city has yet to be reclaimed, and it&rsquo;s said to be haunted both by Thrane ghosts and by undead forces left behind by the Karrns.</p>
<h4 id=thaliost>
<a href=#thaliost class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Thaliost</h4><p>An ancient Aundairian city seized during the Last War, Thaliost was ceded to Thrane under the Treaty of Thronehold. Many of its people bitterly oppose the Thrane occupation, but it&rsquo;s also become a haven for Aundairian followers of the extremist Pure Flame sect; violence often breaks out between these two factions.</p>
<h3 id=aftermath-of-the-last-war-7>
<a href=#aftermath-of-the-last-war-7 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Aftermath of the Last War</h3><p>The war is over, but deep rifts remain between Thrane and its neighbors. Aundairian war magic created a blasted wasteland between the two nations. To the east, the conflict with Karrnath left farms and cities such as Shadukar devastated and abandoned, home only to the lingering undead left behind after the Karrnathi retreat.</p>
<p>For most, these grim reminders of war strengthen Thrane resolve. The common people are united by their faith and sure of the righteousness of their cause. The Silver Flame urges people to stand together in the face of evil, and across the nation, villagers work together to repair the damage inflicted during the war. People in a Thrane village regularly cooperate to raise a barn or practice archery in the fields.</p>
<p>The Silver Flame urges its followers to feel compassion for all people, which often proves a more difficult challenge. Thrane has never forgiven Karrnath for its use of undead soldiers, and many Thranes are quick to imagine all Karrns as agents of darkness. Likewise, Thranes have bitter memories of the conflict with Aundair, and Aundairian wizards or eldritch knights receive a cold reception.</p>
<p>For most Thranes, the war strengthened their faith and drew them together. However, some question the validity of theocratic rule. Such doubt can be found even among the most devout followers of the faith; such people fear that the merging of temporal and spiritual authority distracts the church from its proper mission. If these doubts spread, a serious faction might seek to restore Queen Diani to power.</p>
<p>Thaliost is another open wound. The Council of Cardinals is determined to hold onto this prize, but it is a bitter point of contention with Aundair and a constant source of tension and violence. In creating a Thrane character, consider how you feel about Thaliost. Would you like to see it returned to Aundair, or do you support Thrane&rsquo;s rule?</p>

<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Entertainers, international intrigue, spies</p>
<p>After forging a united kingdom, Galifar I realized early on that the crown could not rule from one of the existing realms. To do so would be to put one of the Five Nations above the others, and that would lead to breaks and fractures that would eventually destroy the kingdom. Thus, he established his seat of power on an island in Scions Sound. There he built the great castle of Thronehold.</p>
<p>After Jarot&rsquo;s death and the rejection of the line of succession that led to the Last War, the island and castle were largely abandoned. A special detachment of House Deneith guards, the Throne Wardens, remained in place to protect the castle, but all government functions ceased with the collapse of the Kingdom of Galifar.</p>
<p>Throneport, a town in the shadow of the castle, became a place for dissidents, criminals, spies, and mercenaries, and the once safe port turned into a rough-and-tumble town without allegiance to any single nation.</p>

<li>Representatives (and spies) of the Five Nations gather in the town of Throneport, where it&rsquo;s impossible to tell friend from foe and alliances shift daily.</li>
<li>Although Cyre no longer has a peacekeeping force on the island, many Cyrans find work here as spies and agents for other nations.</li>

<p><strong>Cold Warriors</strong>. Thronehold is a gladiatorial arena for diplomats and spies, a dangerous playground for bored nobles, and a haven for treacherous double agents. Characters with the charlatan, spy, noble, or criminal background might all test their skills here.</p>
<p><strong>Play It Again</strong>. If diplomats and spies have one thing in common, it&rsquo;s a weakness for pleasant distractions. When not playing their games of deceit, they seek out the best entertainment and companionship the island has to offer. Characters with the entertainer background can make many untrustworthy friends here.</p>

The Treaty of Thronehold further solidified Throneport as a multinational capital under the control of small peacekeeping forces from Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, and Thrane, with House Deneith Throne Wardens in place to make sure the terms of the treaty are honored. Today, the small city is neutral ground, but the castle and its grounds remain off limits and under the watchful protection of the wardens.</p>
<h2 id=valenar>
<a href=#valenar class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Valenar</h2><p><strong>Capital</strong>: Taer Valaestas</p>
<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Elves, horses, mercenaries</p>
<p>In the midst of the Last War, an army of Tairnadal warrior elves from Aerenal seized this region from Cyre, invoking a claim to the land from long before humanity&rsquo;s arrival on the continent. The elves of Valenar devote themselves to the arts of war. Their cavalry has no equal in Khorvaire, and they combine a talent for magic with stealth and swordplay. Cyre employed the Valenar as mercenaries until the elves betrayed Cyre and took a corner of the nation for themselves. These lands escaped the destruction visited upon the rest of Cyre. After the Mourning, no one wanted to challenge the Valenar&rsquo;s claim to the land they had taken; in the interests of peace, the Treaty of Thronehold recognized the new elf kingdom of Valenar.</p>
<p>Valenar elves spend little time at rest, operating in small units called warbands. Those who aren&rsquo;t patrolling the kingdom travel abroad seeking adventure. Half-elves handle the civic administration. Some of these are the children of Valenar elves, but most are immigrants who&rsquo;ve come from elsewhere in Khorvaire in search of opportunity. Cyran humans still occupying the region fall below them in rank. Once citizens of Cyre, now they&rsquo;re citizens of Valenar. Little has changed for the commoners, most of whom don&rsquo;t care who wears the crown.</p>
<p>The harsh sands of the Blade Desert cover northern Valenar and serve as a natural barrier between this land and the rest of Khorvaire. Beyond the desert, Valenar transitions from rolling steppes to fertile plains. The desert can be deadly, but the Valenar elves pose the greatest risk for adventurers. The elves won&rsquo;t interfere with peaceful caravans, but a well-armed group of travelers invites challenges.</p>

<li>The ancestors of the elves fought goblins for control of this region many thousands of years ago. Relics of that struggle are still scattered across Valenar and the Blade Desert: ruins, haunted fortresses, and battlefields that have slipped out of alignment with time.</li>
<li>Valenar warbands include druids and rangers, and druidic magic bolsters the military arsenal of the elves. Walls of thorns surround elven fortresses, and beasts fight alongside the elves. Valenar horses are known for being as fearless and stubborn as the elves who ride them.</li>

When creating a Valenar character or NPC, consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>Martial Role</strong>. Valenar was forged in war. As an elf, consider your role in a warband. Are you a simple soldier, an acolyte devoted to the elven ancestors, or a sage familiar with your Valenar history? As a half-elf, you might be an entertainer, a sailor, or a guild artisan working to support the elf army, or you might be a charlatan seeking opportunities. As a human from Valenar, you could be an urchin born in Taer Valaestas, or a folk hero fighting for the common people.</p>
<p><strong>Dreams</strong>. Have you left Valenar behind, or are your aspirations tied to the new kingdom? As a half-elf with Valenar blood, do you want to be recognized as a true Valenarâ€”granted a bond to a patron ancestor and a chance at immortalityâ€”or are you more interested in building a homeland for your people? As a human whose land the elves reclaimed, do you want to work with the elves or do you want to drive them outâ€”and if so, who do you want to replace them?</p>
<p><strong>Animal Companions</strong>. Feytouched beasts play an important role in Valenar society. The Valenar are known for their steeds, but a wide range of Valenar beasts bond with non-elves. As a starting character, you might not have established a connection to a Valenar beast. If you return to Valenar later in your adventuring career, perhaps you will find your bondmate.</p>

House Lyrandar has invested in the city and built shipyards and a large house enclave. The port sees traffic from Q&rsquo;barra, Sarlona, and Aerenal. When the region was part of Cyre, this city was known as Southport, a haven for smugglers and pirates.</p>

Located in the center of the kingdom, the city is built for war and surrounded by a living wall of bronzewood thorns. In addition to the royal palace, outposts of most dragonmarked houses, and a market where foreigners sell their wares, Taer Valaestas hosts the primary temple of the Keepers of the Past and a vast arena used for horse training, races, and other displays of equestrian skill.</p>

The Treaty of Thronehold recognized Valenar as a sovereign nation, but the elves are already pushing the limits of the treaty. Some venture into the Mournland or the untamed jungles of Q&rsquo;barra, and Valenar warbands have launched raids into Darguun and Karrnath. High King Shaeras Vadallia has promised to rein in his warriors, but many believe that the elves will continue their provocation. Their main interest is conflict with a worthy foeâ€”and they might want Darguun or Karrnath to declare war.</p>
<p>Because of this, the nation remains on a war footing. Villages find it challenging to produce the supplies required to maintain the elf army. Still, the Valenar are rarely cruel overlords. As long as a village can meet its quotas, the elves leave it alone, though villages that fall below expectations are more likely to receive assistance from druidic advisors than punishment.</p>

<p><strong>Hallmarks</strong>: Alchemy, education, elemental binding, entertainment, gnomes, precious stones</p>
<p>At first glance, the homeland of the gnomes appears to be a paradise. City streets are bright and clean, the universities and libraries are the finest in Khorvaire, everyone seems happy and helpful, and crime is all but unheard of. But Zil society teems with layers of intrigue and blackmail invisible to human eyes. The Trust, a ruthless secret police force, eliminates any threat to society.</p>

</span>
</p>
<p>Zilargo isn&rsquo;t a tyranny. Each major city has a democratically elected ruling council and a seat on the Triumvirate that governs the nation; the Trust reports to the Triumvirate. The Zil gnomes built this system, and they are quite happy with it. Their streets are safe, and as long as you play by the rules of the game, the Trust ignores you. Outsiders find this casual acceptance of preemptive assassination to be terrifying, but the Zil genuinely trust the Trust.</p>
<p>Zil gnomes live within a web of intrigues. The Trust condones their actions, as long as they break no laws and don&rsquo;t threaten the state or the status quo. A gnome charlatan can connive to steal a jewel mine from another gnomeâ€”as long as the charlatan accomplishes the deed through cunning, negotiation, or deception rather than violence or outright theft, and as long as the mine stays in Zil hands. The same applies to adventurers planning schemes in Zilargo. Violence draws attention and deadly consequences from the Trust, but intrigue is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>The Trust is a network of spies and assassins. Most agents of the Trust simply pass information through dead drops; some estimate that a third of the nation works for the Trust in this capacity. When the Trust identifies a threat, it acts preemptively. Trust agents prefer to solve a problem without violenceâ€”by sharing a piece of information or a whispered warning sent via a <wc-fetch type=spell>message</wc-fetch> spell. But the Trust won&rsquo;t hesitate to eliminate a threat, whether with poison, spell, or blade. Typically, a target never sees the agent of their demise.</p>

<li>Most consider the Library of Korranberg the finest repository of knowledge in Khorvaire.</li>
<li>The <em>Korranberg Chronicle</em> is the leading source of news in Khorvaire. Gnome chroniclers travel across Khorvaire in search of stories.</li>
<li>The major cities of Zilargo maintain temples and shrines dedicated to every religion. Most Zil explore a few faiths before settling on one; others practice multiple religions.</li>

<p><strong>Family Ties</strong>. In a nation shaped by intrigue, you need someone you can rely on. For the Zil, that&rsquo;s family. Unless you&rsquo;re an orphan, discuss your family with your DM. What&rsquo;s their business? Who&rsquo;s your favorite relative? Are you currently involved in any family schemes? Family members might call on you for help over the course of your adventurers, but they can also be a resource for you.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge and Power</strong>. The Zil prize knowledge above all else. Sage is a suitable background for any Zil; charlatan and spy are also appropriate, reflecting their love of intrigue. Classes that specialize in melee combat are rare among the Zil. The soldiers of Zilargo include rogues, bards, wizards, and artificers.</p>
<p><strong>The Trust</strong>. In creating a Zil character, consider whether you have any ties to the Trust. A vast number of gnomes serve as the eyes and ears of the Trust, reporting interesting information to a Trust handler. As an active agent, you could receive missions tied to your current adventures. If you and your companions are fighting the Emerald Claw, you might have a secondary assignment to eliminate a specific Claw agent or acquire a particular object from their base. While the spy background is a logical choice for a Trust agent, the agency recruits characters of every class and background. Your class abilities reflect specialized training and granted abilitiesâ€”the magical equivalent of spy gadgets!</p>

They design beauty into their architecture, featuring delicate carvings, elaborate railings and balconies, and lavish gardens. Every community contains murals and statues scattered throughout. Most fixtures and buildings are designed for those of small stature, but buildings constructed for taller folk also exist. The Zil have a talent for illusion and for binding elementals, and they incorporate both of these forms of magic into everyday life.</p>

Scores of ships make port here daily. Among the many beautiful things the city is known for are its spectacular coastal thunderstorms. Crowds gather on balconies and verandas to watch these awesome displays.</p>
<p>The Tower of the Triumvirate rises over the central portion of the city. House Kundarak, House Sivis, and House Cannith maintain outposts in the city, and the other dragonmarked houses station agents here as well.</p>

Zilargo avoided most of the violence of the Last War, and cosmetic magic and illusions were employed to repair the few cities that suffered damage. Many Zil prefer to ignore the war completely, referring to it as &ldquo;that unpleasantness to the north.&rdquo; Nonetheless, Zilargo was a staunch ally of Breland during the war, providing the nation with ships, intelligence, and elemental weaponry. This aid left the nation with enemies. The Order of the Emerald Claw has launched attacks on Zil communities, and certain cells of Breland&rsquo;s Swords of Liberty accuse the Zil of manipulating Breland. The Trust has contained these attacks, but it always anticipates more trouble ahead.</p>
<p>The jewel miners of eastern Zilargo often clash with the goblins of Darguun and the kobolds that live in Seawall Mountains. These skirmishes could expand into wider conflicts.</p>
<p>Overall, however, little has changed in Zilargo because the Trust keeps the nation on a steady path. Adventurers who travel through Zilargo would be wise to avoid causing trouble or drawing the Trust&rsquo;s attention.</p>
