These adventures can unfold among the tallest towers of Skyway, in the deepest depths of the Cogs, or anywhere in between. At the end of this chapter is an introductory adventure, &ldquo;Forgotten Relics,&rdquo; set in Sharn.</p>
<p>Sharn can be a grim place that makes good people bad and bad people worse. In its mean streets, gritty detectives contend with corrupt law officers while trying to foil the efforts of merciless gangs and monstrous thugs. In the highest towers, wealthy barons from the dragonmarked houses make shady deals with crime bosses, each of them making profits by exploiting both the ordinary folk and the well-heeled upper crust alike. Corruption can be found among the ranks of government, the watch, the temples, and large businesses. This atmosphere makes Sharn a perfect location for adventures inspired by the noir genre.</p>
<p>Sharn can also be a place of unrelenting action, ranging from soarsleds speeding between the towertops to confrontations in the dungeon depths far beneath the city&rsquo;s lowest tier. Fallen angels, sinister shapeshifters, and monstrous mercenaries do battle with heroes from all walks of life, while unscrupulous collectors and smugglers carry on a brisk trade in artifacts brought back from the cyclopean ruins of Xen&rsquo;drik. All these factors make Sharn an equally ideal location for adventures inspired by pulp action.</p>
<p>You can use the Life in the City table to generate ideas for adventures set in Sharn.</p>

You can use the Home Base table as a source of inspiration, or you can develop a unique location.</p>
<p>Work with the players to develop the connections that each character has to the site. If the location is a tavern, for instance, a bard character might perform there two nights a week. A fighter could be a regular who has a drink named after them. A ranger could be the undefeated champion of the local darts league. If the players enjoy this creative exercise, you could also allow each player to add a physical detail to the place or to describe one of the location&rsquo;s NPCsâ€”the stuffed gorgon head over the hearth, another regular among the customers, and so on. This is a way to make this location truly feel like home, and to give each player a personal investment in it. This location becomes an automatic starting point for adventures, the place where the adventurers will meet with patrons and conduct business.</p>
<p>The Home Base table can also be useful to determine the venue if a patron wants to set up a meeting at a neutral location.</p>

You can expand on an entry to make it the start of an encounter or adventure, though not every event needs to draw the characters into a longer story. Each table is meant to be used on a different level of Sharn: the lower wards, middle wards, upper wards, and Skyway. You can choose results from the tables, or randomly determine what happens, and you can modify results as you please, tailoring the details of an event to be a better fit for a particular district. The events on the tables are phrased so they can be read aloud or summarized to players.</p>

Maybe they avert their eyes and keep walking, as many residents of Sharn have trained themselves to do. Maybe they rush to get involved, or poke around delicately to learn more. An event like one of these doesn&rsquo;t have to be the start of an adventure, but it can beâ€”particularly if it really catches your players' imagination.</p>
<p>When the players decide to learn more, it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out what they can discover. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did the people involved in this event get to this place? What were they doing earlier today? Where were they going when this event happened?</li>
<li>Why isn&rsquo;t anyone else getting involved? What is complicating this situation?</li>
<li>What do the people involved hope is going to happen next? What are they afraid might happen next? How are the circumstances changed because the characters have witnessed the event?</li>

The crisscrossing paths of Sharn heights allow criminals to come and go in different directions, looking like normal passersby as they trade information, cut purses, or throw people to their dooms.</p>

Each bridge is 20 feet higher (on average) than the one immediately below it.</p>
<p>The bridges are connected to businesses and residences. The residences are usually locked, while most shops lock up at night. The taverns and gambling dens are open for business all day and well into the night. One of the bridges connects to a skycoach parking station, which houses several of those vehicles. Other bridges lead to an elevator, garden overlooks, and staircases that take pedestrians farther up and down into the city.</p>

An upstanding citizen could be driven to murder by passion. A refugee could become a cutpurse out of desperation. The rowdy Brelish veterans who call themselves the Brokenbridge Brawlers don&rsquo;t think of themselves as criminals, and they have no connection to any larger organization.</p>
<p>Any professional criminal in Sharn, however, is likely to be affiliated with one of four organizations. The Boromar Clan is the most entrenched and widespread of the four, and has dominated the business of crime in Sharn for centuries. The group called Daask is on the rise, directly challenging the Boromars. The Tyrants and House Tarkanan are smaller organizations with more specialized areas of operation. These groups are summarized in the Criminal Organizations of Sharn table and described in the later sections that follow.</p>
<p>Each of these organizations has a core of operatives and enterprises under the direct control of its leaders. But each also has a network of secondary relationships.</p>
<p>For example, the Little Fingers are a group of pickpockets and cutpurses that work in the Bazaar of Middle Dura. They aren&rsquo;t directly tied to the Boromar family. But the master of the gang pays a tithe to the Boromars, and if the Boromars send word to them that certain targets are to be avoided, the Little Fingers do so. In return, the Boromars ensure that the Sharn Watch in Middle Dura largely leaves the Fingers alone. So although the Boromar Clan itself has a few hundred members, it has interaction with thousands of criminals throughout the city.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 provides an overview of the four major criminal organizations and a body of information about them that&rsquo;s more or less common knowledge in Sharn. This section explores the roles that each one could play in a Sharn-based campaign.</p>
<p>Although the powerful organizations in Sharn have a hand in most criminal activity, sometimes you might want an adventure to involve a smaller gang. The Street Gangs table presents a number of lesser criminal groups adventurers could tangle with.</p>

The following drugs are just two of the most notorious substances available in the City of Towers and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon&rsquo;s Blood</strong>. Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon&rsquo;s blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug&rsquo;s effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn&rsquo;t something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon&rsquo;s blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook.</p>
<p><strong>Dreamlily</strong>. A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during the Last War, it&rsquo;s now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn&rsquo;t illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it&rsquo;s heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> for 1 hour. While <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly.</p>

Operating out of its headquarters and key holdings in the Little Plains district of Middle Menthis, the Boromar Clan controls gambling, smuggling, and theft in Sharn. Most of the city&rsquo;s burglars, pickpockets, and fences either work for or pay tithes to the organization. The Boromar Clan&rsquo;s network of extortion, bribery, and blackmail extends from Lower Dura to Skyway.</p>

</span>
</p>
<p>The Boromars' influence extends beyond criminal enterprises into many legitimate circles of power. Ilyra Boromar sits on the city council, and a number of other councilors are close allies of the clan. The family has ties by marriage to House Jorasco. A Boromar attends every Skyway party. The family owns tenements throughout Sharn and invests in shipping, storing both legal goods and contraband in many of the warehouses in Precarious and Cogsgate. In many districts, local officials and Sharn Watch officers have been taking bribes from the Boromars for generations.</p>
<p>The criminal nature of the Boromar Clan is an open secret, and in some districts the Boromars are seen as hometown heroes. They are immigrants who&rsquo;ve made good, common people who&rsquo;ve risen to rival the barons and kings. They give the people what they want, whether it&rsquo;s untaxed gambling, cheap spirits, or dreamlily. The clan operates with a degree of impunity because its operatives adhere to an unspoken rule: whenever possible, criminal acts against individuals should target tourists and travelers. Boromar pickpockets don&rsquo;t prey on the people they see every day. Instead, they seek out the many strangers who move around the city all the time. The Watch officer who turns a blind eye to a pickpocket thus feels justified, since it&rsquo;s not the citizens of Sharn that are victimized.</p>
<p>Boromar&rsquo;s longstanding status at the head of Sharn&rsquo;s criminal enterprises has recently come under challenge. After nearly a decade of slow growth, the Droaamish mob known as Daask has recently started targeting Boromar holdings. The halfling clan hasn&rsquo;t faced such a serious threat before, and it&rsquo;s scrambling to figure out how to deal with Daask&rsquo;s guerrilla tactics.</p>

Most Boromar leaders despise unnecessary violence, but the clan has a host of enforcers and a handful of capable assassins. The clan&rsquo;s web of extortion is so thoroughly woven into society that many residents simply consider it another form of tax. Boromar specializes in three fields of activity: gambling, smuggling, and thievery.</p>
<p>Gambling isn&rsquo;t illegal in Sharn, but all legal games are taxed by the Brelish crown and are required to follow regulations that spoil the experience for many. Boromar&rsquo;s operations are cheaper to participate in and offer the lure of greater profits.</p>
<p>Smuggling has become an increasingly important business since the Last War disrupted many traditional lines of trade. The clan&rsquo;s primary import is the narcotic called dreamlily. But the Boromars traffic in a wide range of goods, from arcane and alchemical weapons to foreign luxury items that have been made scarce by embargoes and sanctions. Under Boranel&rsquo;s law, it&rsquo;s forbidden to sell Aundairian wine in Breland, so if you want the good stuff, you&rsquo;ll need to work with the Boromars.</p>
<p>Boromar-sanctioned acts of thievery include the activities of the ubiquitous pickpockets that can be found across the city as well as the well-planned jobs of professional burglars. As mentioned earlier, Boromar thieves focus their attention on visitors to Sharn, thus avoiding friction with local law enforcement. When appropriate, stolen goods are transported out of the city by the fences and porters that drive the clan&rsquo;s smuggling operations.</p>

Some of the organization&rsquo;s most important people are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saidan Boromar is the current patriarch of the family. He grew up in Lower Dura and worked as a thief and assassin there before taking over the organization.</li>
<li>Mala Boromar d&rsquo;Jorasco is an heir of House Jorasco and the Boromar family matriarch. Her position in the family ensures that important members of the Boromar Clan receive Jorasco healing services at no cost to them; Saidan reimburses Jorasco from the clan&rsquo;s treasury.</li>
<li>Councilor Ilyra Boromar is the eldest daughter of Mala and Saidan and a member of the city council. The Boromars' enemies on the council have grown bolder in the face of increased Daask attacks against the clan, and some of Ilyra&rsquo;s influence has eroded as a result.</li>
<li>Halak Boromar is the family&rsquo;s chief enforcer. A recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains, Halak leads the Clawfoots, the Boromars' personal guard, and is an accomplished warrior.</li>
<li>Ilsa Boromar is the family&rsquo;s leader in Callestan. She is ruthless in protecting her family&rsquo;s interests.</li>
<li>Castar, a gnome, is the lone non-halfling in the Boromars' inner circle. He serves as Saidan&rsquo;s chief advisor and the organization&rsquo;s intelligence expert. The family looks to Castar to come up with a plan to defeat Daask, but so far none of his ideas have worked.</li>
</ul>

The finer establishments are places for the Boromar Clan to wine, dine, bribe, and extort the city&rsquo;s powerful elite. At the other end of the spectrum, the run-down gambling halls and dreamlily dens in the poorer districts are places where those in the employ of the Boromars plan heists, store smuggled goods, hide bodies and wanted criminals, interrogate Daask spies, make good on threats, and unwind.</p>
<p>These places are public and expertly run by the city&rsquo;s most powerful criminals, so an openly violent approach to problem-solving in such a spot is likely to end in tragedy for the characters. When combat does occur in one of these nightclubs, it&rsquo;s usually because the instigators have brought enough strength of arms to take on the Boromars.</p>

Made to accommodate customers from halflings to ogres, the club&rsquo;s double doorways are 10 feet wide, and its ceilings are 15 feet tall. Hooks, shelves, handrails, and furniture are provided at three different levels and sizes.</p>
<p>The nightclub has three entrances. Two are connected to the outside: a main entrance guarded by a bouncer and a back door that is locked from inside. Another locked entrance is connected to a stair that leads up and down to other levels in the nightclub&rsquo;s tower.</p>
<p>The club&rsquo;s main entrance opens into an entry vestibule. The attached cloakroom has a hidden door that leads to a secret room where criminal meetings and illegal activities take place.</p>
<p>The casino floor in the nightclub has tables running games of chance, a bar, and a raised stage. Bathrooms, a kitchen, and private rooms for high-roller games (and more criminal meetings and illegal activities) are accessible from the casino floor.</p>
<p>Boromar&rsquo;s security and management offices are connected by a hallway to the casino floor, the secret meeting room, and a second secret area used to store illegal contraband or captives. Occupants of both offices can see into these attached areas by way of magic one-way mirrors.</p>

It is most infamous for its monstrous enforcers, but the organization also draws members from the destitute populace of Sharnâ€”largely goblins and shifters, but also humans, dwarves, and any other humanoid who feels that the current system has failed them. Daask makes its money through acts of violence, from mugging to armed robbery to outright pillaging. The group has diversified in recent years, building an extortion racketâ€”threatening violence if tribute isn&rsquo;t paidâ€”and entering into the drug trade, selling both dreamlily and a mysterious substance called dragon&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>From the outside, Daask appears to be interested solely in fomenting violence and chaos. The monstrous nature of its members reinforces this impression; most people consider the members of Daask to be savage beasts. The truth is more complicated. The Droaamites who make up the core of Daask aren&rsquo;t merely criminals; they are elite soldiers of Droaam working for Sora Katra, and part of an operation that is taking root in larger cities across Khorvaire. The seemingly random attacks by Daask are part of a larger plan that, if it succeeds, will eventually give Sora Katra a foothold in the heart of Khorvaire.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, the Daask cell in Sharn has been waging a slowly escalating war against the holdings of the Boromar Clan. The Boromars were surprised by the violence of these attacks and have suffered significant losses. Daask prefers guerrilla tactics, using only as many combatants as necessary to get a job done, never staying in one place too long, and quickly retreating back to their turf. Though the Boromars still control much of criminal activity in the middle and upper parts of Sharn, Daask is gaining ground in the lower level of the city and controls crime in the Cogs.</p>
<h3 id=daask-operations>
<a href=#daask-operations class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Daask Operations</h3><p>Violence and intimidation are Daask&rsquo;s most used tools. Rather than using bribery, Daask manipulates the Sharn Watch through displays of force and brutal reprisals against officers who dare to stand in the way. Coupled with the fact that Daask primarily targets businesses with ties to the Boromars, this means that many of the Watch officers of the lower wards will step aside and allow a Daask raid to run its course.</p>
<p>As Daask has seized territory from the Boromar Clan, it has also begun taking over a few of the clan&rsquo;s traditional businesses. In addition to dreamlily, Daask sells a highly addictive drug called dragon&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>Daask has another, perhaps surprising area of operation: religion. The organization has brought priests of the Dark Six to Sharn and has restored a ruined temple to the Dark Six in Khyber&rsquo;s Gate. Followers of the Dark Six have few other opportunities to practice their faith, and providing this new facility for them has made many allies for Daask across the city.</p>

The Droaamish soldiers that make up the core of the organization include changelings, gnolls, harpies, ogres, minotaurs, medusas, trolls, and other monstrous beings. Basilisks, cockatrices, death dogs, displacer beasts, and similar monsters are kept by Daask, though these creatures are usually used only within the Cogs.</p>
<p>Some of Daask&rsquo;s most important members are these individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sora Katra is the ultimate leader of Daask, but as one of the Daughters of Sora Kell, she remains in Droaam. The hag stays in contact with all of her main subordinates by magic and keeps a detailed ledger of the group&rsquo;s activities.</li>
<li>Cavallah is a disciplined female oni and the current leader of the Daask cell in Sharn. She is the mastermind of the organization&rsquo;s machinations against the Boromar Clan, a scholar obsessed with studying Sharn&rsquo;s manifest zone, and a devoted servant of Sora Katra. The oni wears a <em>hag eye</em> (see &ldquo;Hags&rdquo; in the Monster Manual) that enables Sora Katra to both see and hear what occurs in her presence.</li>
<li>Harash, a male medusa, is Cavallah&rsquo;s right hand. He is a specialist in diplomacy and intimidation whom Cavallah trusts to monitor the members of Daask and maintain morale.</li>
<li>Ash is a female human priest of the Shadow. As the most powerful and beloved of Daask&rsquo;s priests, she runs the Temple of the Six. Some worry that Ash plans to challenge Cavallah for leadership, which could cause a rift in the organization&rsquo;s membership.</li>
<li>The gnoll Keshta commands a small unit of elite gnoll commandos. Disciplined and ruthless, these soldiers are often called upon to carry out retaliatory strikes against those who defy Daask.</li>
<li>Zaeran, an elf werewolf, is a recent arrival to Sharn. He&rsquo;s one of the sons of the Droaamish warlord Zaeurl. Zaeran has come to the city with a small group of wererats and werewolves, and has an agenda known only to himself and Sora Katra.</li>
</ul>

The most popular gathering location is a Cog hub. The dark, twisting halls of these underworld hot spots are familiar to Daask members and confusing to their enemies. A Cog hub&rsquo;s tight passages have plenty of choke points, forcing one-on-one confrontations in which Daask&rsquo;s powerful monsters often have the advantage. Daask also uses Cog hubs to stash bodies, drugs, or prisoners.</p>
<p>Trying to find a Daask hub in the Cogs is an adventure in itself. Most members are understandably tight-lipped about the location of their meeting and hiding places. Once the characters know a hub&rsquo;s location, they still must navigate the mazelike Cogs to find the place.</p>
<h4 id=cog-hub-features>
<a href=#cog-hub-features class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Cog Hub Features</h4><p>The Cog hub shown in map 4.13 could be a Daask location, or it could be any Sharn underworld location you need it to be. Several crafted and natural labyrinthine passages no more than 10 feet wide lead to the main chamber. Many of these passages connect with stairs, ladders, and wells that lead higher or lower in the Cogs, in addition to small chambers that could be ambush points, temporary quarters for criminals or squatters, or places to lay a trap or place an alarm trigger.</p>
<p>These passages converge into a single large chamber that can hold a large group for meetings and serve as a temporary safe house or a place to stash contraband. When criminals occupy the area, at least one guard is always on duty, and typically there is one guard at every entrance to the chamber.</p>
<p>Smaller rooms with heavy iron doors adjoin the largest chamber. These rooms can serve as holding cells for captives, vaults for valuables, or hiding spots.</p>

If you want, this can be the only role they play in a campaign: a ready source of sudden violence. Low-level characters might work with the Sharn Watch or the Boromar Clan to curtail Daask muggings and raid dreamlily houses. This crusade against Daask will escalate as the adventurers become more powerful; Daask will unleash ever more powerful monsters, and its forces might start targeting the adventurer&rsquo;s allies and loved ones. Those attacks won&rsquo;t end until the adventurers delve deep into the Cogs and defeat Cavallah herself.</p>

Though the Sharn Watch acts as though Daask is a problem only for Malleon&rsquo;s Gate, and not a threat to law-abiding citizens, there is clear cunning in the criminal cabal&rsquo;s actions. Their recent attacks have targeted properties throughout the lower wards, all owned by a certain halfling family, as if Daask were attempting a violent takeover of Sharn&rsquo;s underworld. Once these monsters control the city&rsquo;s crime, what will they do next?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another option is to delve deeper into the motives of Daask, to explore the idea that these monsters aren&rsquo;t as savage as they appear. The elite members of Daask are spies, soldiers, and saboteurs using their criminal activities as a cover for their true agenda. What is Sora Katra really trying to accomplish in Sharn? This question ties to how you decide to use the Daughters of Sora Kell, described earlier in this chapter. Do the Daughters simply want to ravage their enemies? Or, guided by the oracular visions of Sora Teraza, are they actually working toward some greater good? For instance, Daask agents could break into the vaults and workshops of dragonmarked houses and discover secret projects forbidden by the Treaty of Thronehold. They could clash with spies of foreign powers in Sharn, or pursue ancient artifacts in the ruins below the city to keep them out of others' hands.</p>
<p>Dreamlily is relatively safe; dragon&rsquo;s blood is not. Its effects are intentionally unpredictable, and you can take this idea wherever you like. Could drinking dragon&rsquo;s blood cause someone to develop a dragonmark? Could it turn addicts into crazed, draconic creatures? Is Daask simply selling it to make money, or is the drug&rsquo;s introduction part of a grander plan? Neither the Boromar Clan or the dragonmarked houses have been able to learn anything important about dragon&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>Daask can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in chapter 1. The Daask Assignments table provides objectives for adventurers working with the organization, and the discussion of crime syndicates in chapter 1 includes additional ideas for parties with a crime syndicate patron.</p>

It&rsquo;s not their fault; they&rsquo;re touched by Khyber, and the Dragon Below twists their minds. All aberrants will eventually become killers. And though I can see the appeal in using these creatures as weapons against our enemies, how could we bring such vipers into our midst?</p>
<p>According to a high-ranking source in the King&rsquo;s Citadel, this secret operation predictably ended in disaster. After a few missions, the strike force slew their handlers and deserted, disappearing into the criminal underworld. They could be anywhere. There can be no clearer sign that it&rsquo;s time to bring down the monarchy and institute a government that is chosen by and answerable to the common people!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long ago, the dragonmarked houses sought to exterminate the bearers of aberrant dragonmarks. Today, those who carry aberrant dragonmarks are still treated with fear and suspicion. During the Last War, the King&rsquo;s Dark Lanterns of Breland trained a team of covert operatives who all bore aberrant marks. Considered expendable, this group was sent on one suicide mission after another. After half its members died in the field, the survivors turned on their masters. Six years ago, they fled to Sharn and founded House Tarkanan. The group takes its name from Lord Halas Tarkanan, who fought the dragonmarked houses long ago and used his aberrant dragonmark to destroy Old Sharn.</p>
<p>The smallest of the four criminal organizations described here, House Tarkanan has no interest in claiming territory or dominating the criminal underworld. The house takes neither side in the war between the Boromar Clan and Daask, and it will not assassinate high-ranking members of either organization. In other matters, it sells its services to all who have the gold to pay for them. House Tarkanan&rsquo;s top priority is using its wealth to protect, train, and care for people who have aberrant marks. The leaders of the house are pragmatists and soldiers, and they train their recruits to be warriors and thieves.</p>
<p>Despite its name, House Tarkanan is not a dragonmarked house; it has taken the name to mock its enemies, and it doesn&rsquo;t have the recognition, power, or resources of a dragonmarked house. In fact, many members of House Tarkanan hate the dragonmarked houses for being prejudiced against their kind and fear that they will instigate a second purge of aberrant marks. Others are more idealistic, and see the growing power of the houses as a threat to all of the nations of Khorvaire.</p>

Fees for jobs are based on the task&rsquo;s complexity and riskiness; a simple cutpurse contract costs far less than the assassination of a Sharn Watch captain in Skyway.</p>
<p>What differentiates the assassins of House Tarkanan from those of House Phiarlan and Thuranni is their accessibility. The dragonmarked houses sell their services only to a select list of wealthy and powerful clients, and they can pursue contracts anywhere in Khorvaire. Conversely, anyone with enough gold can hire House Tarkanan&rsquo;s assassins, but they take jobs only within Sharn.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thora, a female human, has the ability to sense mystical energiesâ€”a gift that enables her to identify others with aberrant marks. She founded the organization and serves as its leader. While she uses the name Thora Tarkanan among her compatriots, she has established herself as Thora Tavin among the wealthy elite of Sharn and has cultivated relationships with many influential people.</li>
<li>Rotting Bal is one of Thora&rsquo;s most trusted lieutenants. A male human, Bal was part of the original squad of aberrant commandos. He&rsquo;s an exceptional martial artist whose skills are enhanced by his mark.</li>
<li>Zae is a female halfling who has the power to speak to and control vermin. Though she&rsquo;s no warrior, her gift helps the house gather information.</li>

But they can also play a central role in a campaign.</p>
<p>To use House Tarkanan as a recurring villain, you can stress its ruthlessness and emphasize its hatred of the dragonmarked houses. If any of the adventurers have ties to one of the houses, this confrontation could begin with a number of small attacks against the adventurer or their friends. Over time, these actions could escalate. In addition, you could build a story around Thora Tarkanan&rsquo;s quest to discover the secrets of aberrant dragonmarks. Long ago, Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague possessed marks so powerful that they could destroy cities. Can Thora find a way to amplify her own power in the ruins of Old Sharn?</p>
<p>If one or more of the adventurers has an aberrant dragonmark, House Tarkanan can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in chapter 1. The House Tarkanan Assignments table provides hooks for adventurers who are working with the organization, and the discussion of crime syndicates in chapter 1 includes additional ideas.</p>

This organization of changelings deals in secrets and lies, selling forgeries, running long cons, and treating identities as a commodity. The Tyrants have spies throughout the city, even in places where they have no current plans or contracts. The organization gathers as many secrets as possible, then sells that information to the highest bidder, uses it for blackmail, or stores it for a time when it becomes useful.</p>
<p>The Tyrants have been operating in Sharn for over three hundred years from a base of operations in the Dragoneyes district, in Lower Tavick&rsquo;s Landing. They have agents spread across the city. A beggar, a bartender, or a courtier could actually be a persona crafted by a Tyrant changeling. The Tyrants have a long-standing truce with the Boromar Clan and don&rsquo;t take a side in the halfling family&rsquo;s conflict with Daask.</p>

Much like the Boromar Clan, they have a general live-and-let-live relationship with the Sharn Watch. As long as the Tyrants focus their crimes on foreigners and touristsâ€”and donate generously to the local Watchâ€”the officers will look the other way. In addition to pursuing their own schemes for gold, Tyrant charlatans offer a host of services to their clients; they can help to frame innocents for crimes, or make it possible for a criminal to seem to be in two places at once, providing an ironclad alibi.</p>
<p>The finest forgers in the city are in the ranks of the Tyrants, capable of duplicating anything from identification papers to works of art. Magewrights among the Tyrants have the ability to permanently alter someone&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Tyrants deal in information. They hoard secrets, and for the right price they can be persuaded to share what they know. Occasionally a Tyrant approaches someone with an offer of information in exchange for gold.</p>

The majority of the members are changelings. They often maintain multiple identities, and a particular identity might be shared among a group of changelings. A captain in the Sharn Watch who is actually an agent of the Tyrants might be portrayed by a member of the Tyrants' inner circle in the morning, when he has to interact with a wide range of people. But when he goes off-duty in the evening and keeping up the identity is an easier task, the role might be taken over by a young recruit.</p>
<p>The following individuals are some of the Tyrant&rsquo;s most important identities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ek, often called Tyrant One, guides the inner circle of changelings that leads the organization.</li>
<li>Kilk is the city councilor for Lower Tavick&rsquo;s Landing and is a fictional persona created by the Tyrants, played by a variety of changelings at different times.</li>
<li>The Spider is a changeling information broker who owns a cosmetics store called Honest Faces in the Dragoneyes district. This location is a common destination for people who want to purchase secrets from the Tyrants. Though the Spider often sells secrets for gold, sometimes it will trade its knowledge only for services or other secrets.</li>

In dealing with the Tyrants, there is always a question of what is real and what the true objective actually is. With the Tyrants, anything could be a long con, and both allies and enemies may not be who they appear to be.</p>
<p>The Tyrants have three objectives: acquiring gold, gathering secrets, and protecting the changelings of Sharn. In working the Tyrants into a campaign, the first question is which of these objectives will take precedence. Are they primarily grifters, trying to squeeze as much profit as possible out of the situation? Are they mainly working to gather secrets, and to use those secrets to manipulate others? Or are they most concerned with helping other changelings, who are often with the objects of fear and suspicion?</p>
<p>The Tyrants offer an easy way to provide adventurers with information. The Spider can be a strong ally for adventurers, and you can always arrange for an agent of the Tyrants to step out of the shadows with and offer to sell a secret.</p>
<p>The Tyrants could also have a long-term sinister agendaâ€”something they&rsquo;ve been working on for generations, which is only coming to fruition now. Do they want to replace the entire city council of Sharn, or are their aspirations even higher than that? In a campaign that examines this idea, the Tyrants might impersonate the patrons and allies of the adventurers, thereby tricking them into carrying out questionable tasks.</p>
<p>The Tyrants can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in chapter 1, especially if the party includes one or more changelings. The Tyrants Assignments table provides hooks for adventurers working with the organization, and the discussion of crime syndicates in chapter 1 includes additional ideas.</p>

This assessment is close enough to the truth. There&rsquo;s an important undercurrent in the situation, however. Although most officers of the Watch take bribes, that doesn&rsquo;t mean all of them don&rsquo;t care about their city and won&rsquo;t try to keep their communities safe; they do so because they see their benefactors as being an important part of the continued health of their community. For instance, those officers who take gold from the Boromar Clan believe that the Boromars help keep the city running and give the people what they want. But if some strangers in town break the law, they&rsquo;re just troublemakers who deserve to be run in.</p>
<p>As another example, the guards of the Dura Bazaar have an understanding with the gang of pickpockets known as the Little Fingers. As long as the thieves target only tourists and foreigners, the Watch will dismiss any charges brought against them. Why should an officer of the Sharn Watch care if some Aundarian with more gold than sense gets robbed? But if the Little Fingers pick on a local, they&rsquo;re asking for trouble. The relationship works both ways; the pickpockets are privy to things the Watch officers aren&rsquo;t, and they often warn the Watch about suspicious people or activities they witness.</p>
<p>Watch officers do exist who are entirely crooked and care nothing for the law. At the other extreme, some officers are entirely honorable and place the law above all else, and most of those are willing to risk their lives to save an innocent bystander from a rampaging Daask troll. But most members of the Watch are pragmatists who put the needs of their clients uppermost, the needs of the citizenry second, and generally don&rsquo;t take action against locals.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that the Watch&rsquo;s response to a crime can vary significantly depending on the nature of the crime and where it&rsquo;s committed. As a rule, when a crime is committed in Skyway, any of the upper or middle wards, Lower Central, Lower Tavick&rsquo;s Landing, or Precarious, members of the Watch arrive to intervene and investigate as soon as possible. In Cliffside, Lower Menthis, and Lower Northedge, the few Watch members in these locations address crimes in order of priority. In Lower Dura and the Cogs, the Watch&rsquo;s reponse is typically very slow.</p>

The Watch also includes a few special divisions that could cross the paths of the adventurers.</p>
<p><strong>The Blackened Book</strong> is an elite core of abjurers and diviners, charged with investigating and containing magical threats. These wizards are highly dedicated to their work and their city, and generally don&rsquo;t take bribes. It&rsquo;s up to the higher-ups, however, to decide what missions to assign to the Blackened Book; if there&rsquo;s a case that a noble doesn&rsquo;t want investigated, it probably won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p><strong>The Guardians of the Gate</strong> came into being during the Last War to monitor the activities of foreign nationals and immigrants. Their duties have expanded since the surge of refugees into Sharn following the Mourning, and the Guardians of the Gate closely supervise the district of High Walls. The Guardians are chosen from among the best soldiers of the Watch and are devoted to their city. Many of them, however, place the safety of the city ahead of strict adherence to the law, and complaints are raised against them from time to time for unnecessary violence against refugees.</p>
<p><strong>The Redcloak Battalion</strong> is an exceptional unit of soldiers that is called upon if a situation calls for extreme military force. The Redcloaks are heroes of the Last War, and now that the fighting is over most of them don&rsquo;t appreciate being used as local police. The Redcloaks are absolutely faithful to Breland: they are willing to lay down their lives in the service of their nation. Trying to bribe a Redcloak is a good way to lose a hand. Like the Blackened Book, however, the Redcloaks are elite troops that act only when they&rsquo;re mustered by a captain of the Watch; typically, they won&rsquo;t be asked to respond to a situation if it&rsquo;s not in the interests of the Boromar Clan. The Redcloak Battalion is described in more detail in chapter 3.</p>

You can select from or roll on the Sharn Watch Races and Sharn Watch Personalities tables to generate a Watch NPC. There is a 75 percent chance the NPC is taking bribes from the Boromar Clan or another wealthy patron. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the officer is willing to take a bribe from one of the adventurers.</p>

Tethyn Olar has led that arm of the Sharn Watch for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Many immigrants owe their safe and comfortable lives in our city to this man, but claims have surfaced recently charging him with corruption, saying that he took money from immigrants in exchange for a faster path into Sharn. Olar has refuted those claims with this statement: &ldquo;Look at the lower wards to see the vast number of poor immigrants the Gate allows to enter in the city. Those with wealth tend to be more responsible and quicker to put their paperwork together, but none with worthy cause to be here are barred.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the Sharn Watch&rsquo;s most important people are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lord Commander Iyan ir&rsquo;Talan is a male human in charge of the Sharn Watch. As long as the city&rsquo;s wealthy elite are content to keep Iyan in power, he does little more than maintain the status quo.</li>
<li>Commander Lian Halamar is a male halfling who leads the garrison in the Daggerwatch district in Upper Dura. The Boromar Clan bribes Lian to make sure the Watch is away from the scene during their criminal activities. The Boromars are pressuring Lian to crack down on Daask, but he has no desire to put his officers in danger unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Commander Belew Yorgan is a male dwarf who leads the Sword Point garrison in Middle Central. He does his best to serve the interests of the nobles and wealthy patrons in the Central Plateau, and as a result these wards are among the safest in Sharn. But Yorgan&rsquo;s loyalties are first and foremost to his purse, and the troops under his command serve whoever&rsquo;s paying the most.</li>
<li>Commander Silaena Cazal is a female elf who runs the Warden Towers garrison in Middle Menthis. Over a century of service, she has woven a net of graft and extortion across Menthis Plateau; she looks after those who pay their dues. Her mother was driven from House Phiarlan when she developed an aberrant dragonmark. Because of that treatment, Silaena harbors deep resentment for the dragonmarked houses and will occasionally take actions to inconvenience them. Thora Tavin of House Tarkanan is working to strengthen her relationship with Commander Cazal.</li>
<li>Commander Iyanna ir&rsquo;Talan is a female human who commands the Black Arch garrison in Lower Tavick&rsquo;s Landing. The daughter of the Lord Commander, Iyanna is idealistic and honorable. She fights for the good of the common people. If the adventurers need an honest ally in the Watch, Iyanna is perhaps their best hope. Despite her father&rsquo;s best efforts to keep her from getting entangled in the criminal underworld, her actions have won her no friends among Sharn&rsquo;s crime lords, and her life could be in danger despite her parentage.</li>
<li>Lady Warden Maira ir&rsquo;Talan, a distant relative of the Lord Commander, leads the Blackened Book. A gifted diviner, Maira is a highly effective leader. What none know is that she&rsquo;s also an agent of the Dreaming Dark. Five years ago, a kalaraq quori (see chapter 6) named Tirashana implanted a mind seed in her thoughts. Maira continues to do her job while concealing any evidence of the Dreaming Dark&rsquo;s schemes.</li>
<li>Captain Daja Brel is a female human who commands the Guardians of the Gate. Daja firmly believes that the Guardians are all that stands between order and chaos in Sharn, and she acts with unbridled force if she believes a group or an individual threatens the city.</li>
<li>Captain Khandan Dol is a male dwarf who leads the Redcloak Battalion. Khandan is a local legend who served in the Brelish army throughout the Last War; he was knighted by the last king of Galifar and swore an oath to the first queen of Breland. He enjoys drinking and gambling. He takes discipline seriously, though, and expects his soldiers to show complete loyalty to their country and its king. Because of his experiences in the war, he has a deep dislike for Thranes and followers of the Silver Flame, but he rarely lets these feelings interfere with his duties.</li>

The largest are the garrison posts like Daggerwatch and Sword Point; smaller stations in various places are used to hold criminals, dispatch patrols, and take care of day-to-day business.</p>
<p>A typical Sharn Watch station has two well-guarded entrances. One is connected to a main vestibule, where an officer in a security room with a magically reinforced window signs visitors in and confiscates their spell components, spellcasting focuses, and weapons. The other entrance is a large barred and warded door that leads to the garage, which holds skycoaches and soarsleds. Both of these areas are connected to the station&rsquo;s bullpen by way of locked and warded doors.</p>
<p>The Watch Station Adventures table offers reasons why the characters might need to visit (or break into) such a location.</p>

Lian Halamar is the primary agent of the Boromar Clan, and if the adventurers are fighting the Clan, any interaction with the Watch can ultimately come to Lian&rsquo;s attention, with his corruption slowly becoming more and more evident. If the characters oppose House Tarkanan, it could be Commander Cazal who keeps interfering with their investigations and placing obstacles in their way. Can the adventurers find a way to remove their rival from power?</p>
<p>Another option is to focus a story on Commander Iyanna and her efforts to purge corruption from the Watch. A chance encounter could bring the two together; perhaps the adventurers are on the scene when Iyanna is targeted by assassins. Iyanna could call on the adventurers to investigate corruption and to deal with officers who are breaking their oaths. How deep are they willing to go?</p>
<p>If the adventurers do form an alliance with a Watch officer, you can use the Sharn Watch Assignments table to create adventure hooks for parties and side quests for individual charactersâ€”cases their ally doesn&rsquo;t trust the Watch regulars to handle fairly.</p>

The elements collide in fantastic explosions of unbridled power, motes of earth careen erratically through space as gravity constantly shifts, and a riot of colors blazes through the ever-shifting sky. Still, stoic githzerai monks exert their will over the elements, crafting monasteries on islands of earth amid the chaos. Several varieties of slaadi dwell here as well, exulting in the endless turmoil.</p>

New arrivals are subject to forced conscription when encountered (whether by angel, demon, or devil), if they aren&rsquo;t summarily dispatched. Amid the constant strife, windstorms of blades scour the landscape, capable of cutting the unprepared to ribbons.

<p>Syrania is home to a host of angels that devote their immortal lives to serene contemplation. Each angel seeks to achieve mastery of one pure concept, such as holding all the knowledge on a subject or ceaselessly abiding by the tenets of a virtue. An angel of dreams isn&rsquo;t a quori, but it understands dreams, it can explain and interpret them, and it can shape them if it chooses. Likewise, an angel of war isn&rsquo;t constantly embroiled in battle as the celestials of Shavarath are; instead, it seeks perfection in the art and theories of war. Angels of Syrania can be useful sources of information for adventurers, and sometimes travel to Eberron to observe mortals.</p>

In this utterly alien environment, beings whose appearance can shatter a person&rsquo;s sanity live in cities crafted from gargantuan, fleshy tumors. Seas of protoplasm, in a shade of purple that hurts the eyes, lap against shores of chitin. Some can look upon Xoriat and see it as a place of revelations, but most mortals who come too close to Xoriat fall prey to madness. Xoriat is the source of many aberrations, including the terrifying daelkyr.</p>

<p>The three progenitor wyrms worked together to form Eberron and its planes as a new cosmic system in the depths of the Ethereal Plane. They recreated the elves, orcs, dragons, and other races found throughout the multiverse and placed them in their new world, but allowed them to develop beyond the reach of Gruumsh, Corellon, Lolth, and other influences for good and ill.</p>
<p>In your campaign, you might decide that the barrier formed by the Ring of Siberys is intact, and contact between Eberron and the worlds and planes beyond its cosmology is impossible. This is the default assumption of this book. On the other hand, you might want to incorporate elements from other realms. Perhaps you want to use a published adventure that involves Tiamat or the forces of the Abyss meddling in the affairs of the world. In such a case, it could be that the protection offered by the Ring of Siberys has begun to fail. You might link the weakening of Siberys to the Mourningâ€”perhaps whatever magical catastrophe caused the Mourning also disrupted the Ring of Siberys, or perhaps a disruption of the Ring of Siberys actually caused the Mourning!</p>
<p>If contact between Eberron and the wider multiverse is recent and limited, consider the implications for everyone involved. In the Great Wheel, Asmodeus is an ancient threat, with well-established cults, lines of tieflings, and a long history of meddling that sages might uncover in dusty old tomes hidden in remote libraries. But if Asmodeus has only just discovered Eberron and begun to influence it for the first time, there is no lore about him to be discovered on Eberron. He has no power base and needs to recruit new followers. Unusual alliances might form against him, as celestials and fiends join forces to expel this hostile outsider.</p>

If you revere the Silver Flame, its power is always with you. The Sovereign Onatar guides the hand of every smith who knows how to listen for his voice, and Dol Arrah and Dol Dorn are active on every battlefield, guiding every soldier. This outlook means that religion is driven by faith, as opposed to the concrete actions of deities. The faithful believe that their triumphs reflect the assistance of a divine influence. They don&rsquo;t expect a god to physically show up and solve their problems.</p>
<p>Fiends and celestials certainly do have physical form, however. Fortunately for the folk of the Material Plane, these extraplanar creatures are deeply invested in their own affairs and have little interest in Eberron. Demons and angels battle one another in Shavarath, but they&rsquo;ve been doing this since before humanity existed, and they dare not leave their posts to fool around elsewhere. Exceptions do exist, such as the daelkyr and the Dreaming Dark, but by and large these natives of other planes are exclusively concerned with where they live. As such, player characters are more likely to encounter celestials and fiends that are native to Eberron, spawned by Khyber or Siberys, rather than extraplanar entities.</p>

Along with the dragons, they battled the fiendish overlords of Khorvaire and Sarlona. Ultimately, the couatls sacrificed most of their number and combined their souls to form a prison to hold the overlords. Scholars have theorized that their combined souls eventually became the force that is worshiped by the Church of the Silver Flame. The church is ambivalent on the topic, preaching that regardless of how the Flame was first kindled, there is a place within the Flame for all noble souls.</p>
<p>The few couatls that remain on Eberron are devoted servants of the light. They are most often found guarding the prison of the ancient fiendish overlords, and individuals sometimes act directly to aid adventurers who fight the forces of darkness.</p>

Dozens of overlords were imprisoned by the Silver Flame at the dawn of time; two of them, Rak Tulkhesh and Sul Khatesh, are detailed in chapter 6. Anotherâ€”Bel Shalor, the Shadow in the Flameâ€”is bound within the Silver Flame itself in the great cathedral in Flamekeep in Thrane. You can adapt other evil gods or archfiends for an Eberron campaign (assuming you don&rsquo;t want Eberron to be connected to the wider multiverse) by recasting them as overlords. For example, Tiamat could be an overlord embodying the pride and potential for evil within dragons, Lolth could be an overlord who preys on the elves, and Asmodeus the insidious maker of profane bargains.</p>
<p>Any fiendâ€”whether devil, demon, yugoloth, or something elseâ€”could be spawned by Khyber if it suits your story. Such fiends might be bound to an overlord, or they might be independent incarnations of evil unleashed on the world. Two other races of fiends, though, play important roles in its history.</p>

Today, they remain impartial mediators, and adventurers who are about to deal with outsiders or other planes of existence might want to seek the advice of a night hagâ€”although one can be quite difficult to find.</p>
<h4 id=rakshasas>

When the overlords were defeated in the first age of the world by the combined might of the dragons and the couatls, the rakshasas largely disappeared into Khyber as well. The Lords of Dust are made up largely of rakshasas, scheming in the shadowsâ€”many trying to free their imprisoned overlords, others looking for a way to claim their masters' power for their own.</p>

The lightning rail and vessels powered by bound elementals and operated by the dragonmarked houses, can carry passengers as far in an hour as a horse can walk in a day. This section discusses issues related to travel in an Eberron campaign and presents the Gold Dragon Inns, a chain of hotels that offer consistent accommodation for travelers anywhere in Khorvaire.</p>
<p>As described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide, it&rsquo;s up to you whether you gloss over travel in your campaign or narrate it in more detail. If the point is to get the characters to their destination so they can get the adventure underway, it&rsquo;s fine to assume that their journey (whether it&rsquo;s by lightning rail, airship, or more mundane means) passes without incident. After all, the people of Khorvaire make such trips every day, and most of them reach their destinations safely.</p>
<p>The alternative is to make the journey an important part of the adventure. Travel can play a crucial role in a story, and when it does, you should give it as much time at the game table as it needs.</p>
<h3 id=elemental-vessels>

The heart of the process is a set of techniques for binding elementals that uses Khyber dragonshards. This closely guarded procedure requires delicate engineering, arcane skill, and rare materials from around the world, and different workshops employ varying esoteric techniques. Building a new vehicle can occupy a workshop for months while magical energy is painstakingly inlaid into the vessel&rsquo;s hull. Such work is a complicated task requiring the labor of many; it is not something that can be undertaken by a lone wizard for any amount of compensation.</p>
<p>The construction of elemental vessels requires the use of two kinds of dragonshards. A Khyber dragonshard of the largest size and finest quality is required to bind the elemental to the vessel, and a Siberys dragonshard is needed to craft the vehicle&rsquo;s helm. Production of new vessels grinds to a halt without a steady supply of both kinds of dragonshards, and a workshop with an order to fill will pay a handsome fee to adventurers who can find them.</p>
<h4 id=elemental-matrix>
<a href=#elemental-matrix class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Elemental Matrix</h4><p>Every elemental vessel is imbued with an <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>, arcane matrix. This magical essence extends from the containment chamber at the core of the vehicle to the binding struts, then through the rest of the vehicle&rsquo;s hull. When a Khyber dragonshard holding a bound elemental is placed in the containment chamber, the matrix comes alive. The unsuppressed elemental emerges from the shard and flows along the matrix in the way that blood moves through the arteries and veins of a living creature.</p>
<p>The binding struts force the elemental into a ring shape and give every elemental vessel its distinctive appearance. From there, the elemental continues to flow along the matrix through the hull, appearing as jagged, snaking lines of living energy that pulse and shift. These conduits of elemental energy take on an appearance associated with the type of elemental bound into the vessel. A fire elemental, for example, sends tendrils of flame along the hull of its ship.</p>
<p>At the command of the vehicle&rsquo;s dragonmarked pilot, the bound elemental can be suppressed, causing its essence to flow back into the containment chamber and the matrix to disappear from view. A vehicle whose elemental is suppressed ceases to be propelled.</p>
<h4 id=controlling-the-elemental>
<a href=#controlling-the-elemental class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Controlling the Elemental</h4><p>Piloting an elemental vessel requires effective communication between the pilot and the bound elemental. The elemental controls the vehicle&rsquo;s movement, and everything from basic propulsion to delicate maneuvering is dependent on the ability of the pilot to control the elemental. If the elemental is uncontrolled and not suppressed, the vehicle moves according to the elemental&rsquo;s whim until a pilot asserts control again.</p>
<p>A dragonmarked heir at the helm of a vessel can command the elemental easily. Without such a pilot, it&rsquo;s very difficult to control the vessel. A character who is touching either the Khyber dragonshard where the bound elemental is housed or the magic item at the vessel&rsquo;s helm can try to communicate with the elemental, but with no guarantee of success.</p>
<p>A character can make a DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check to persuade the elemental to cooperate or demand its obedience. On a successful check, the elemental obeys the character for 1 minute.</p>
<p>The <wc-fetch type=spell>dominate monster</wc-fetch> spell can also enable a character without a dragonmark to control an elemental vessel, even wresting control away from a dragonmarked pilot. The <wc-fetch type=spell>charm monster</wc-fetch> spell (found in Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything) also makes the elemental compliant to the caster&rsquo;s wishes, but the elemental remains obedient to the commands of a dragonmarked pilot at the helm.</p>

On most elemental vessels, the shard is sealed in a protective metal chest with 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) hit points, usually made of iron (AC 19) but sometimes of mithral (AC 21) or adamantine (AC 23). The chest is often guarded with a <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch> and housed in a room behind locked and possibly trapped doors. The shard itself has AC 17 and 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) hit points.</p>

The first airships emerged from the Cannith and Zilargo workshops and appeared in House Lyrandar&rsquo;s service just eight years ago (in 990 YK). For now, though, they remain rare, because the soarwood required for their construction is exceedingly scarce and tightly controlled.</p>
<p>Soarwood is a form of buoyant timber found only on the island of Aerenal, and the elves who live there limit their annual harvest of the precious wood. As a result, production of new airships proceeds at a snail&rsquo;s pace, unable to satisfy the fervent demand for new vessels. The discovery of a new supply of soarwood could literally change the world, and even convincing the elves of Aerenal to part with more of it would be an achievement worth a handsome reward from House Lyrandar.</p>

An air or fire elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, which is suspended on four struts jutting outward. Most airships are outfitted with the finest amenities, including many decorative flourishes and creature comforts.</p>
<h5 id=operation>
<a href=#operation class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Operation</h5><p>A dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar must pilot a Lyrandar airship, channeling the power of the Mark of Storm through the <wc-fetch type=item>wheel of wind and water</wc-fetch> that controls the vessel. The helm is typically situated near the rear of the ship, inside the shelter of a wheelhouse. Controlling the vessel (without the benefit of something like the <em>conductor stones</em> that dictate a lightning rail route) requires constant attention, so at least two pilots typically travel on every journey.</p>
<p>Only a dragonmark heir with the Mark of Storm can use the wheel and command the bound elemental. House Lyrandar pilots train for months to gain a deep understanding of the ship&rsquo;s powers and limitations. Because of this training, a skilled pilot can execute acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.</p>
<p>Airships can move in all three dimensions, with or without the aid of the wind. Unlike most flying creatures, they don&rsquo;t rely on wings for lift thanks to their soarwood hulls. They are able to fly equally well on their sides or even upside down (notwithstanding the risks that such maneuvers present to passengers and crew).</p>
<p>Airships cannot actually land, because the struts that hold the elemental ring in place protrude 10 feet from the bottom of the vessel. Thus, passengers and cargo are lifted in elevators and loaded at towers in major cities. Each ship carries rope ladders for use at smaller stations, in open terrain, or in cases of dire emergency.</p>
<p>A typical airship can reach a speed of 20 miles per hour in clear skies carrying up to 30 tons of cargo. Airships are most often employed by explorers and by wealthy travelers who demand luxuryâ€”clients who have a need to move quickly to places that might not be served by the lightning rail.</p>

When the elemental is suppressed, the ship remains aloft but can&rsquo;t move. The pilot always suppresses the elemental before docking, then uses ropes to maneuver the vessel into position.</p>

Now the system is divided, split into eastern and western circuits. Reestablishing the <em>conductor stone</em> paths across Scions Sound and the Mournland is often discussed in the halls of power in the Five Nations, but formidable challenges are involved.</p>
<h4 id=how-it-works-1>
<a href=#how-it-works-1 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>How It Works</h4><p>A lightning rail train is made up of an elemental vessel linked to a series of connected carts, all of which float about 5 feet off the ground. Each cart, similar in form to a large wagon with no wheels, has a <em>conductor stone</em> embedded in its underside. A corresponding set of <em>conductor stones</em> laid out in a line on the ground interacts with the stones in the carts to form a rail for the train to follow. Lightning arcs between the two sets of stones, accounting for the system&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The elemental vessel at the front of the train, called a crew cart, holds a bound air elemental that propels the train along its route at a speed of about 30 miles per hour. The elemental appears as a ring of lightning encircling the crew cart while the train is in motion. A bound air elemental can move a train of up to ten carts without obvious strain, and most trains are configured accordingly.</p>
<p>The other carts that make up the train have various purposes. A typical train has a crew cart at each end, with two cargo carts, four passenger carts, and two lounge carts in between. Doors at both ends of each cart enable crew and passengers to walk from one to the next, even while the train is in motion. Both crew carts are identical, except that the bound elemental in one is suppressed. On the return trip, the roles of the carts and the states of their elementals are reversed.</p>
<p>Specialized carts of other sorts vary in configuration depending on their purpose and the degree of luxury afforded to them. Some have solid sides and roofs, while others are covered only with canvas.</p>
<p>Map 4.10 shows the different carts that comprise most lightning rail trains.</p>

The pilot controls the elemental and communicates with it during the trip, watching the path ahead through broad windows that encircle the helm platform.</p>
<p>The placement of <em>conductor stone</em> lines dictates where a lightning rail train can travel, but the pilot still must make operational decisions as the coach moves from one city to the next. The pilot controls the vessel&rsquo;s speed based on conditions around the train. When <em>conductor stone</em> lines split, as they do at various hubs along the way, the pilot selects the intended route and directs the elemental down the correct line.</p>
<p>The crew of a train includes handful of chief stewards overseeing a number of lesser stewards who are charged with seeing to the needs of passengers and keeping cargo secured.</p>

There are no stations in the expanses between these settlements, and House Orien rules prohibit lightning rail pilots from stopping anywhere but at a station.</p>
<p>Stations throughout Khorvaire have a similar look and feel, to ensure that each one lives up to the high expectations of House Orien&rsquo;s patrons. White and gold <em>everbright lanterns</em> continually illuminate each station. When a train pulls into the station, loading ramps are moved into position beside each cargo cart, and stairs by each passenger cart. The cargo is unloaded from one side of the train and the passengers from the other.</p>
<p>Individual stations do have distinct touches that reflect local features. For example, the station in Gatherhold, in the Talenta Plains, is decorated with traditional halfling motifs and offers specialized stables for travelers leaving their dinosaurs behind. On a larger scale, the station at Passage, which is the seat of power for House Orien, is a multistoried structure designed as a monument to the majesty and storied history of the house.</p>

Thanks to the efforts of House Ghallanda, there&rsquo;s no better place to take a rest than at one of the hundreds of Gold Dragon Inns that the house operates.</p>
<p>Every city, most towns, and even some villages have a Gold Dragon Inn, and a large city might boast several. Every major road through the countryside has Gold Dragon Inns along much of its length, spaced roughly a day&rsquo;s travel apart. Sometimes an inn is the nucleus of a small community whose industry is focused on providing for the needs of travelers. A few Gold Dragon Inns are found in locations that offer no other comforts for the weary travelerâ€”for example, high in a pass through the Byeshk Mountains, deep in the Karrnwood, or beneath the surface of the Mror Holds.</p>

Prices are fixed (equal to those given in chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook), and the quality of services is reliably modest, with some comfortable upgrades available. Every inn uses one of a small number of possible floor plans, and every inn&rsquo;s restaurant offers the same menu.</p>
<p>The size and number of guest rooms can vary from inn to inn: a small roadside inn has four rooms and a moderately sized common room, while a thriving inn in a large city has forty rooms, a restaurant, and a separate common room, with two stages for entertainment. Because the inns are owned by House Ghallanda, the buildings all include accommodations for halfling-sized guests as well as taller folk.</p>
<p>Because travelers often carry valuables with them, each inn has a heavy strongbox secured with an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell. To make a traveler&rsquo;s stay more enjoyable, perhaps even memorable, House Ghallanda has arranged with House Thuranni and House Phiarlan to employ guild-licensed entertainers at almost every Gold Dragon Inn.</p>
<p>To populate an inn with some distinctive individuals, you can use the Mysterious Passengers table.</p>
