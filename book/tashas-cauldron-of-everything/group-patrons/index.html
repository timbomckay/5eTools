<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Each adventuring group is bound together by the quests it embarks on and by the dangers its members face together. This chapter offers another way to bind your party together: a group patron. These patrons provide a strong binding element: an individual or an organization that unites a party as a team in service to a greater purpose. A group patron can help set the tone of your party&rsquo;s entire campaign. For example, a group whose patron is an academic institution is likely to have a very different story from a group that serves a military. A patron can influence characters' relationships, their backstories, and the types of dangers they face.</p>
<p>During character creation, every player has the opportunity to weave connections between their character and the other members of their party. Rather than (or in addition to) creating a web of established relationships, players can work with the DM to choose a group patron. And if you&rsquo;re interested in being your own patron, see the &ldquo;<strong>area Being Your Own Patron</strong>&rdquo; section at the end of the chapter.</p>

The description of each patron provides an overview of the types of organizations the group patron represents, perks of membership, and quests the patron encourages adventurers to undertake.</p>
<p>With the input of your DM, you can customize these patrons to reflect specific establishments in your campaign world or to serve as a launchpad tailored for organizations of your design. For example, the guild group patron could represent the Harpers or the Zhentarim of the Forgotten Realms, the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild in Eberron, or a homebrew league of caravan guards. Or perhaps a criminal syndicate, military force, or other category of patron better fits the party&rsquo;s goals. Choose and customize the group patron that works best for your party and the types of adventures you want to explore.</p>
<h3 id=group-assistance>
<a href=#group-assistance class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Group Assistance</h3><p>Having a group patron gives an adventuring group a common purpose, which inspires better coordination in the form of guidance and encouragement. As a result of this unity, each member of the party can grant advantage to an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw of another member of the party. To grant advantage in this way, a character and the chosen target must be able to see or hear each other, and neither can be <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>. Once a party member grants this advantage, that individual can&rsquo;t do so again until they finish a long rest.</p>
<h3 id=perks>
<a href=#perks class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Perks</h3><p>A group patron offers your party a number of perks for your service. These range from standard business arrangements, such as a steady wage and access to staff facilities, to extraordinary boons, such as audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. Specific perks are presented in the description of each group patron.</p>
<p>The DM should not feel limited to providing only the perks noted in each group patron&rsquo;s description. Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise, and a patron can use their varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.</p>
<h3 id=assignments>
<a href=#assignments class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Assignments</h3><p>A more hands-off patron can still significantly motivate your group. Maybe you seek adventures based on what pleases your patron, possibly earning status and rewards within your organization. An academy, for example, might not organize particular missions, so you hunt down ancient artifacts knowing that your patron will reward you for bringing them back. You have the freedom to chart your own destiny, while letting the patron shape the nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The world&rsquo;s mysteries are innumerable, but you pursue them with vigor. As operatives for an academy, you seek to unravel the secrets of existence and the deeper riddles beyond.</p>
<p>In your work, you brush shoulders with the wisest in the land, travel to places spoken of in myth, and discover truths beyond imagining. Denying ignorance, you pursue wondrous sights and endlessly unearth new facts. Undiscovered creatures, the covetous dead, and jealous rivals impede your work, but in the pursuit of knowledge, no risk is too great.</p>

Generally, an academy unites a network of learned individuals, allowing them to share their knowledge, further their research, and support common goals. Passing on wisdom to the next generation is part of an academy&rsquo;s mandate, but members find opportunities to undertake far-flung research expeditionsâ€”only so much can be learned in libraries, after all. An academy&rsquo;s focus can be broad or singular, artistic or scientific, mundane or magical. For every topic with unexplored possibilities, an academy seeks to plumb its depths or elevate its study.</p>

<h5 id=compensation>
<a href=#compensation class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Compensation</h5><p>The academy pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences your compensation. On average, the academy pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Alternatively, you receive a bounty (at least 250 gp) for each artifact or relevant discovery you bring back from your adventures and donate to the academy.</p>
<h5 id=documentation>
<a href=#documentation class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Documentation</h5><p>Each member of your group has identification denoting your affiliation with the academy. This association carries clout in scholarly or artistic circles. The academy also secures documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers if your work requires them. Such documents grant you special status, such as access to forbidden regions or neutral standing in embattled areas. Such identification isn&rsquo;t always a boon, though. In a land frequently plundered by foreigners, your documents could mark you as nothing more than aggrandized looters to some.</p>
<h5 id=research>
<a href=#research class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Research</h5><p>Research is part of your group&rsquo;s job, but your patron also has abundant resources to facilitate such efforts. You can call in a favor to delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime activity described in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook and Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything) to a colleague, contact, librarian, or research assistant. You&rsquo;re responsible for covering expenses incurred as part of this research, and the DM determines its success or failure.</p>
<h5 id=resources>
<a href=#resources class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Resources</h5><p>Academies host libraries, museums, record repositories, and training facilities, and you can use them to further your work. You can call in a favor from faculty members to access resources not available to the publicâ€”dangerous relics or magic items, spellbooks, gear, and the like. Additionally, you can consult with the faculty of your academy as the experts in various fields.</p>
<h5 id=training>
<a href=#training class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Training</h5><p>Because you&rsquo;re associated with the academy, you receive a discount on any education you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as a downtime activity (as described in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook or Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything), you pay half the normal cost, assuming the academy teaches that subject. Training in languages, musical instruments, and other tools is also available, at the DM&rsquo;s discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the <wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch> skills by this method, as if you were learning a language.

As students, new professors, or support staff, you aid the work of a senior professor or entire department. If you are further along in your career, you have your own goals and assistants, but you still take on assignments to further the goals of esteemed experts, deans, or the academy as a whole. In any of these cases, a specific contact manages your relationship to the academy.</p>

Academics struggle to keep one step ahead of their scholarly rivals, making many of them suspicious ofâ€”even hostile towardâ€”other intellectuals. Beyond rivals within their own profession, academics face challenges from their subjects (whether members of lost civilizations or magical beings) or suspicious anti-intellectuals. Not everyone wants to be the subject of scholarly scrutiny or thinks that solving the world&rsquo;s mysteries is important or desirable.</p>
<p>The Academy Quests table presents a few of the sort of endeavors your work or studies lead you to undertake.</p>

In what arenas does that being likely hold sway? A powerful lich recruits other ambitious spellcasters, as well as skilled warriors to serve as bodyguards. A dragon values socially adept agents and those who influence society&rsquo;s decision-makers. Consider how your capabilities and interests align directly with those of the ancient being, or how you unwittingly fell into the patron&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>The Ancient Being Operative Roles table suggests a variety of parts you can play within an ancient being&rsquo;s schemes and the backgrounds frequently associated with each role.</p>

Servants of other powerful beings try to stymie your patron&rsquo;s plans, while misguided (or entirely justified) monster hunters seek to rid the world of their ancient foe. An ancient being&rsquo;s lengthy history inspires unusual and potent enemies.</p>

The rulers of a barony could struggle to reclaim the influence they once held, while the new head of a business dynasty might seek to catapult their fortunes to new heights. By aligning with such patrons, you stand to benefit enormously from the fruits of their ambition.</p>

For one assignment, you act as an envoy during delicate trade negotiations; the next, you&rsquo;re sent trekking through mountain passes to gather a favorite flower for a party. Foes are endless, and yesterday&rsquo;s ally might be tomorrow&rsquo;s target. The only things that are certain are the variety of your patron&rsquo;s whims and that tomorrow there will surely be more.</p>
<p>The Aristocrat Quests table presents the sorts of work you might conduct at your highborn patron&rsquo;s request.</p>

<p>A network of criminals employs your group. You could be full-fledged members in good standing with the syndicate or probationary inductees looking to make your mark and earn its trust. Perhaps your group works for the syndicate against your will: you owe them big for a job gone wrong, for killing the wrong person, or simply for being born into a family that&rsquo;s already in conflict with powerful, unscrupulous people.</p>

Whatever form it takes, the syndicate is largely concerned with increasing wealth for its members at the expense of society at large.</p>
<p>Conversely, the syndicate could be an underground organization of good-hearted people fighting against a wicked power structure. Criminal syndicates with a heroic bent include the band of plucky outlaws who hijack taxes from the cruel baron and return them to the downtrodden and a hard-bitten ring of deserters who fight their homeland&rsquo;s invaders.</p>

Someone hires the syndicate to perform a task (such as an assassination), and the syndicate passes 85 percent of the fee on to your group. If the aim is to enrich the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), you have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you steal. Other syndicates take more or less than a 15 percent share, at the DM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<h5 id=contraband>

You don&rsquo;t receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find someplace to purchase them.</p>
<h5 id=fences>
<a href=#fences class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Fences</h5><p>Members or associates of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide and Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything) to the fence. When using the syndicate&rsquo;s fences, you run no risk of a double-cross or other mishap in finding a buyer, but the syndicate takes 20 percent of the sale price as a finder&rsquo;s fee.</p>

Your group knows how to locate these nondescript redoubts and can maintain a poor lifestyle in one for no cost. Revealing a safe house, whether purposefully or by accident, causes you to lose favor with the syndicate and may see you banned from using them.</p>

Someone with your skills cooperates with others for greater purposes that offer both dangerous risks and splendid rewards. The law of the land is your most persistent enemy, but other criminal syndicates challenge you as wellâ€”or become your targets.</p>

<p>Your group has ties to a powerful consortium of professionals who work together for mutual benefit. You might be long-time members of such a guild, descended from a family of crafters or merchants from which you inherited membership, or perhaps you&rsquo;re working to earn entrance on your own merits. If you serve the guild&rsquo;s interests well, it promises to take care of you. Guilds hate to waste valuable assets, after allâ€”that&rsquo;s just bad business.</p>

A conglomerate of blacksmiths, jewelers, carpenters, tailors, alchemists, scribes, and sages all could organize as a guild. Whatever their trade, these experts share contacts, exchange resources such as materials or tools, and leverage their collective influence to affect politics for their benefit. Alternatively, merchants and other business owners might also organize into guilds. Merchant barons who effectively rule a city or nation through iron-clad control of the economy or a network of innkeepers who share news and supply routes could both represent guild patrons. A guild could even embody a more sinister group, such as one that deals in terrifying wares like deadly monsters, dangerous knowledge, or souls.</p>

<td><strong>Eliminate a Rival</strong>. A competitor has humiliated the guild one too many times, and it&rsquo;s time for that to stop.

<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">4</span></td>

<td><strong>The Collector</strong>. Your guild is tasked to create or acquire something wondrous for a wealthy but secretive client&rsquo;s collection.

<p>Your group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger military force, one dedicated to combat missions or other dangerous tasks. You could be a band of mercenaries, a special forces unit, or a squad of regular infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation&rsquo;s people from monsters, or you fight secret battles in the wake of a war that has supposedly ended. Or the nation requires military forces at the edges of civilization to protect the frontier and to lead advancement into new territory.</p>

They can be the disciplined regiments of a nation&rsquo;s standing army, a fleet of ships comprising a kingdom&rsquo;s armada, or a devastating horde of warriors and magical beasts. A given kingdom&rsquo;s military could be a rigidly ordered force or a blood-soaked throng.</p>

<tr>
<th><span class="text-center block">d6</span></th>
<th>Military Organization</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">1</span></td>
<td><strong>Standing Army</strong>. A standing army serves as the highly disciplined and structured guardian of a province or an entire nation. Strict tiers of command ensure coordination between branches of the force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">2</span></td>
<td><strong>Mercenary Company</strong>. Hard-bitten veterans of numerous conflicts, mercenaries serve an employer for coin rather than out of loyalty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">3</span></td>
<td><strong>Expeditionary Force</strong>. This military force is far from home, fighting behind enemy lines or striking into wild, unsettled lands. The force must be fast, self-sufficient, and either diplomatic or decisive to assure their survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">4</span></td>
<td><strong>Horde</strong>. The horde is almost a force of nature, and what it lacks in discipline it makes up in ferocity. It doesn&rsquo;t have a rigid command structure, instead functioning like a pyramid of smaller armies. Horde commanders owe fealty to stronger leaders above them, all the way up to the warlord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">5</span></td>
<td><strong>Planar Conscripts</strong>. This military force battles for cosmic stakes on far-flung planes of the multiverse or fights against extraplanar invasion on the Material Plane. Warriors include conscripts pressed into service in the Blood War, fodder in the thrall of ruthless yugoloth mercenaries, or members of a glorious celestial host defending against fiendish incursion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">6</span></td>
<td><strong>Sky Warriors</strong>. This military force consists of winged creatures, employs magical flight, or sails airships as a sky navy. Traditional defenses are ineffective against attacks from the air, positioning the sky warriors as a fearsome nation or expensive and coveted mercenaries.</td>

The amount varies depending on your organization and your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a modest lifestyle. You receive a small salary (as little as 1 sp per day) and food and housing on a military base. Or you receive 1 gp per day but rely on that money for room and board. With higher rank comes higher pay. As an officer, you maintain a comfortable lifestyle.</p>

Your missions could run the risk of shattering a fragile peace recently established with a rival nation and plunging multiple nations back into war. Or perhaps your group&rsquo;s missions pit you against rival combatants during an active engagement, as you influence the war effort. Rival mercenary companies, armed resistance fighters, and monsters drawn to the presence of bloodshed also present familiar threats.</p>

<p>Your group acts in the service of a religious institution. The patronage of a religious order isn&rsquo;t simply a matter of each member of your party belonging to the same faith, though. The faith&rsquo;s administrationâ€”with its own resources, goals, and leadersâ€”directly sponsors and guides your adventures.</p>

Perhaps your group is a team of devotees pursuing a cause for your faith, or maybe you&rsquo;re a bunch of cynics taking advantage of a wealthy congregation. Your collective faith could compel you to hunt evil monsters or stave off otherworldly invasions, to protect the powerless from oppression, or to spread the teachings of your religion in a hostile land. Or perhaps you serve a corrupt hierarchy by making its enemies quietly disappearâ€”though even cynical mercenaries can become true believers when confronted with the miraculous.</p>

<p>A leader without allies is not long a leader. You serve a sovereignâ€”a national figure or otherwiseâ€”and work to achieve their goals no matter the cost.</p>
<p>As agents of a sovereign, you serve as diplomats or enforcers, spies or fixers, bringers of aid or executors of justice. You work within the system to uphold the status quo or step beyond the law to prevent war and worse. Politics, espionage, and mystery are facts of your world, as is hope and the fragile promise of peace.</p>

Queens, chieftains, sultans, and rajahs are ready choices for powerful individuals who patronize a party of adventurers. Those on track to become such individualsâ€”such as cunning senators, royal heirs, or influential celebritiesâ€”also fill a sovereign&rsquo;s role. When choosing or creating a sovereign to serve, consider whether that leader commands a government organization or another faction. While this section assumes your patron is the head of a country or other national body, they could oversee a powerful private division, a cult of personality, or an elaborate expedition. Also, consider the scale of your patron&rsquo;s organization. While serving as spies engaging in international intrigues could lead to world-changing escapades, being fixers for the mayor of a struggling town offers a personal connection to a place and its people.</p>

</span></p>
<p>With the sovereign as your group&rsquo;s patron, you gain the following perks.</p>
<h5 id=elite-access>
<a href=#elite-access class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Elite Access</h5><p>While in service to the sovereign, you have access to the highest echelons of society. With your patron&rsquo;s permission, you can gain access to the halls of power, from national capitols and military headquarters to noble estates and troves of state secrets. You can also request that the sovereign grant you access to perks of their position, like access to diplomatic receptions or use of the royal guards.</p>
<h5 id=expenses-1>
<a href=#expenses-1 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Expenses</h5><p>Your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required to account for your expenses and must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic services don&rsquo;t draw a second glance.</p>
<h5 id=immunity-1>
<a href=#immunity-1 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Immunity</h5><p>As long as you remain in the sovereign&rsquo;s good graces, you are nearly immune to prosecution under the laws within their sphere of influence. When you are carrying out your orders, you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to go about that, and the law isn&rsquo;t an obstacle. Committing serious crimesâ€”especially if they are unrelated or unnecessary for the assigned workâ€”is a sure way to fall out of your patron&rsquo;s good graces, however.</p>
<h5 id=salary-2>
<a href=#salary-2 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Salary</h5><p>Your employment under a sovereign patron brings an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM&rsquo;s discretion, your salary increases or decreases depending on the sovereign&rsquo;s nature, the type of work you perform, and the length of your employment.</p>
<h4 id=sovereign-contact>
<a href=#sovereign-contact class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Sovereign Contact</h4><p>You might benefit from direct contact with your group patron. This includes audiences or secret meetings with the sovereign, depending on the nature of your work. Alternatively, the sovereign might purposefully want to keep their distance from you, either due to their busy schedules or to maintain plausible deniability regarding your work. In such cases, an advisor or functionary oversees your assignments, serving as the primary contact between you and the sovereign.</p>
<p>Roll or pick from the Sovereign Contact table to determine who manages the relationship between you and the throne, if not the sovereign directly.</p>

The needs of a leader potentially embroil you directly in political intrigues, court maneuverings, or threats from national foes.

While some of your missions involve official tasksâ€”missions undertaken in the sovereign&rsquo;s nameâ€”others might be covert, making your patron&rsquo;s identity a highly guarded secret. Political rivals, enemy countries, and natural disasters all pose dangers to the sovereign&rsquo;s nation. Yet a sovereign who sows chaos, enacts tyrannical decrees, or jeopardizes a population&rsquo;s way of life is likely to inspire rebellions. In such cases, a sovereign&rsquo;s agents must decide where their loyalties lie.</p>
<p>The Sovereign Quests table presents a few of the sorts of missions you undertake for your liege.</p>

<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/book/TCE/068-02-010.png alt="In the city of Sigil, Guildmaster Rhys realizes that finding capable recruits is one of the main challenges of being a patron" class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>For some players, the idea of running a crime syndicate, mercenary company, arcane scholars' collective, or other organization is far more exciting than working for someone else. Founding your own organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though potentially at the cost of support and reliable work.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re the boss, the perks of belonging to an organization become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary company, for example, you need to stock your own armory, rather than drawing on an existing organization&rsquo;s stockpile. The organization brings in income, but you&rsquo;ll have to spend it to keep the organization running.</p>
<p>When you run your own organization, use the Downtime Activity: Running a Business downtime activity (described in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide) to reflect your organization&rsquo;s ongoing activities. More than one character can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling to determine the business&rsquo;s performance, add the total days spent by the characters to the roll to determine the business&rsquo;s success (still observing the maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, multiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who took part in this downtime activity.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t discount the value of adopting an NPC to serve as your contact within your own organization. A secretary, majordomo, or apprentice keeps up with your group&rsquo;s bureaucracy while you&rsquo;re conducting missions and passes along information that could lead to your next adventure!</p>
