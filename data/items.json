      "Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.",

      "<b><i>Iggwilv's Curse</i></b>. When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent <wc-fetch type=\"spell\">gate</wc-fetch> spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.",

The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.",

The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the <i>Mind of Metal</i>, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.",

Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.",

The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.",
