<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Characters undertaking this adventure will spend a significant amount of game time on the journey to the Monastery of the Distressed Body and the lost city of Daoine Gloine. You can help bring those weeks of exploration to life with random encountersâ€”some of which might increase or decrease the length of the characters' journey, as you decide.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 of Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything includes random forest encounters, Underdark encounters, and mountain encounters. Or you can roll for or select more detailed encounters using the following tables.</p>

<td>A pack of Sprite pester the party, playing tricks and attempting to steal small items until the characters leave their territory. If they are treated with deference, the sprites might help the characters find the correct path and hurry them along. If assaulted in any way, fifteen Sprite riding Stirge attack. (The sprites' invisibility extends to the stirges as well while they are mounted.)</td>

<td>The path leads into a lonely grove that serves as the grave of a former dryad queen. If appropriate respects are paid, the characters have a 50 percent chance to receive a supernatural gift (see chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide)â€”a charm that allows a character to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>Galder&rsquo;s Tower</wc-fetch> spell (see appendix E) once as an action.</td>

<td><span class="text-center block">3</span></td>
<td>A Treant and a Stone Golem were magically locked together during an ancient battle. Over the centuries since, fey gardeners have turned the two into a temple. Characters who explore the temple might inadvertently help the treant or the golem finally overcome its foe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">4</span></td>
<td>A leprechaun (use Quickling statistics from Volo&rsquo;s Guide to Monsters) crosses the characters' path. If successfully caught without being killed, the creature negotiates its release with the location of its hidden treasure: 1,000 gp in brightly polished coins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">5</span></td>
<td>Gathering firewood results in a visit from an angered undead Treant. (Use normal statistics, but the creature has the undead type and cannot use its Animate Trees feature). The treant collects all such fallen branches to take to a hidden graveyard of treant remains, and it angrily attacks any characters who get in its way.</td>
</tr>

<td>Some strange creature has wandered down from the Monastery of the Distressed Body. Such creatures might include an ancient security construct gone mad (use Oaken Bolter statistics from Mordenkainen&rsquo;s Tome of Foes) or a Gibbering Mouther with a mechanical skull housing its central brain.</td>

<td>The characters come across a group of roving outlaws (five to ten Thug led by a Bandit Captain), who are heading to the monastery to join its ranks. They possess rumors and fragments of a map, and are keen to steal the characters' resourcesâ€”especially if Gearbox the modron is present.</td>

<td>The characters discover signs of past expeditions to the Barrier Peaksâ€”the remains of travelers crushed by fallen rocks. If searched, the bodies might still possess useful gear or fragmentary maps showing the layout of Daoine Gloine. But a close inspection shows that some bodies have had part of their flesh melted away (from encounters with wandering ooze-folk).</td>

A character must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check for the party to pass. But these galeb duhr have an instinctive knowledge of each other, granting advantage or disadvantage on the check depending on how the other galeb duhr was treated. If the other galeb duhr was killed, this one attacks as soon as the characters are recognized.</td>

<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">8â€“10</span></td>
<td>An isolated village clings to the mountainside, populated by Kenku descended from Daoine Gloine refugees who fled the city when it was flooded with ooze. The kenku still remember ancient legends their forebears told about a cult of the medusa, as well as Kwalish&rsquo;s arrival and the &ldquo;plague of ooze.&rdquo; However, their ability to speak only in mimicry might make it challenging for the characters to communicate with them. In the course of the conversation, the kenku might mimic the sounds of destruction and screaming heard as the city was overwhelmed, relay the mad ranting of the medusa, and so forth. They might even repeat the words of Kwalish himself as he talks of his extradimensional experiments with glass baubles, and his efforts to hide his lab inside of one.</td>
