<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>No matter what hook brings the characters into the adventure, any research into Kwalish&rsquo;s lost laboratory—or any NPC familiar with the inventor&rsquo;s failed expedition to the Barrier Peaks—establishes that seeking out the gnome known as the Cartophile is a crucial first step for their mission.</p>
<h2 id=the-cartophile>
<a href=#the-cartophile class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Cartophile</h2><p>Anaxi Zephries is a wealthy gnome merchant and sage. He is well known for his vast collection of maps, which cover the known world, pocket dimensions, routes across the planes, and more. In this role, the Cartophile has served as patron for numerous expeditions of exploration, sending adventurers to all corners of the world—both to draw new maps and to verify the authenticity of others already in his possession.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span>
</p>
<p>The gnome&rsquo;s collection contains notes and an initial map from the early stages of Kwalish&rsquo;s expedition into the Barrier Peaks. In exchange for allowing the characters to use that lore, he asks only that any further journals, notes, maps, and other documents from Kwalish&rsquo;s earlier expedition be returned to him.</p>
<p>The Cartophile has no interest in adventuring, talking of how he once stood too close to a <wc-fetch type=item>Bag of Holding</wc-fetch> accidentally placed within a <wc-fetch type=item>Portable Hole</wc-fetch> and never fully recovered from it. However, in the interest of ensuring a successful mission, he offers the characters the services of a number of hirelings in his employ—and insists that at least one of those hirelings accompany the party, to serve as custodian of his maps and materials.</p>
<p>If the characters develop an especially close relationship to the Cartophile, the gnome might reveal that his professional career commissioning expeditions and maps has been background research for a personal obsession. One of his ancestors took part in Kwalish&rsquo;s lost expedition to find Daoine Gloine, the mythical city of the Barrier Peaks inhabited by &ldquo;people of glass.&rdquo; The gnome has long sought to learn the truth of the expedition&rsquo;s demise.</p>

Each hireling is also charged with chronicling the party&rsquo;s progress along the way, in the hope of finally mapping the route to Daoine Gloine, and has specific value to the party in certain areas of expertise. However, each hireling also has one or more secret agendas that might work against the characters' interests.</p>
<p>You can let the party&rsquo;s size and the players' interest in bringing NPCs into their group determine whether more than one of the Cartophile&rsquo;s hirelings join the expedition. Or, instead of front-loading hirelings at the start, these NPCs can be set up as independent explorers not connected to the Cartophile. You can stagger their introduction throughout the course of the adventure (as suggested in each NPC&rsquo;s description below), with each one able to provide a useful next step to help the expedition along.</p>
<h4 id=ctenmiir-the-vampire>
<a href=#ctenmiir-the-vampire class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Ctenmiir the Vampire</h4><p><em>LE male vampire</em></p>
<p>Once a dwarven warrior, Ctenmiir was transformed into a Vampire and hidden away within White Plume Mountain (see Tales from the Yawning Portal) until captured there by an Emerald Enclave ranger. The vampire has long been imprisoned within a magical iron coffin mounted atop animated golem legs (an early Kwalish design), forced to atone for his evil deeds by working for the Cartophile.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/timbomckay/image/upload/f_auto/adventure/llk/002-ctinmiir_wmask.png alt=undefined class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span>
</p>
<p>Ctenmiir&rsquo;s coffin has a speed of 30 feet and a climbing speed of 10 feet, and protects the vampire from sunlight even as it prevents him from escaping his servitude. Though Ctenmiir is able to speak from within the coffin and help guide the expedition, the coffin obeys only the commands of the party members. Cold, calculating, and manipulative, the vampire aids the party as long as he believes he can earn his release from the coffin along the way—by any means possible.</p>
<h5 id=value-to-the-party>
<a href=#value-to-the-party class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Value to the Party</h5><p>Originally native to an area near the Barrier Peaks, Ctenmiir has much experience with the initial route into the mountains, and can provide warnings of early encounters through the fey woods and foothills (see &ldquo;<strong>area Reaching the Peaks</strong>,&rdquo; below, and appendix A). The vampire&rsquo;s coffin can also serve as a makeshift <wc-fetch type=item>Apparatus of Kwalish</wc-fetch> at your determination, making it easier for characters to explore Daoine Gloine—though Ctenmiir will need to first be released. The coffin can also be used as protective shelter against adversaries, including a freed Ctenmiir.</p>

<p>If he joins the expedition from the start, the vampire might lead the characters to the foothills, then claim to no longer recognize the route ahead. He asks to be released so that he can scout more easily. But if he is, any promise of obedience he makes to the characters is ignored as he attacks them.</p>

<p>The Cartophile&rsquo;s first choice to join the characters' expedition, Garret is an untrustworthy bon vivant and magpie. His mapmaking skills are first rate, though, and the Cartophile trusts him to accurately detail the route to Daoine Gloine and sketch images of things discovered along the way. Garret claims that his infernal lineage goes back to Levistus (see Mordenkainen&rsquo;s Tome of Foes), and he keeps his horns adorned with rings, coins and other charms, some of which he claims are powerful magic items ready to be called on. See appendix C for Garret&rsquo;s stat block.</p>

This message takes the form of a written note from Garret&rsquo;s infernal patron, ordering the Grand Master to return to Stygia in the Nine Hells to complete a service required by Levistus.

If both Garret and Gearbox join the expedition, Gearbox assists the tiefling with his work, even as Garret delights in referring to the modron as &ldquo;Doohickey&rdquo;, &ldquo;Contraption&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thingamabob&rdquo;, and so on.</p>

<p>Mary claims to be part of a legendary lineage as granddaughter of the vampire Drelzna—herself a descendant of Iggwilv and Baba Yaga. Her warlock pact has been made with those ancestors' spirits, but she manages her relationship with them carefully, lest she fall too far under their dark influence.</p>

</span>
</p>
<p>She also claims past tutelage by Thingizzard, a witch dwelling in the fens near White Plume Mountain. In addition to her work for the Cartophile, Mary is eager to accompany the expedition so that she might search the Barrier Peaks for rare ingredients for her potions.</p>
<p>Mary strikes an eerie, witch-like figure, surrounded always by swirling magical-mechanical trinkets of her own devising. She is often seen shuffling a <wc-fetch type=item>Deck of Several Things</wc-fetch>, and will try to quietly tempt party members to draw a card. (See appendix D for more information on the deck, and its distinct connections to the adventure.) Mary is always accompanied by her familiar, a glowing-eyed cat. See appendix C for Mary&rsquo;s stat block.</p>

(Readers of <em>Dragon+</em> might alternatively make Mary one of the intelligent cats of Adam Lee&rsquo;s &ldquo;Herding Tahra&rsquo;s Cats&rdquo; in issue 12). But of more potential peril to the party is Mary&rsquo;s long-term relationship with Ctenmiir, whom she first met when he would fly out of White Plume Mountain at night to meet with her near Thingizzard&rsquo;s hut. Her goals are to keep the knowledge of her true form and her relationship with Ctenmiir a secret; to free the vampire if she can, without incriminating herself; and to convince characters to draw from her <em>deck of several things</em>.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="text-center block">81–86</span></td>

<td><span class="text-center block">87–95</span></td>

From wherever the characters start, it takes a journey of several weeks to reach the foothills of the peaks. You might consider adding a few wilderness encounters along the way, especially within the thick band of woods that surrounds the pass leading up and into the mountains, and which is infused with elements of the Feywild. See appendix A, &ldquo;Random Encounters,&rdquo; for more information.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to incorporate random encounters into the journey to the Barrier Peaks, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mountains of the Barrier Peaks have grown steadily closer as you near the end of weeks of travel, making use of the old notes and maps of Kwalish&rsquo;s failed expedition. Traversing a thick band of woods over the past several days, you&rsquo;ve dealt with troublesome sprites by day and swarms of blood-sucking stirges by night. But finally, the trees begin to thin out as you enter the rocky foothills of the range.</p>
<p>Exactly as indicated on the original expedition&rsquo;s map, you find a cleft in the rocks that leads to the start of a twisting tunnel complex. As you prepare to enter, you bid farewell to the world of life and light as you leave it behind you&mldr;</p>
