<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>The known route of Kwalish&rsquo;s original expedition ends at the series of tunnels leading into the Barrier Peaks, with no sense of how that long-lost company proceeded. However, recent carvings have been etched into these tunnels in thieves' cant and Infernal, marking the route to the monastery for new recruits. The markings can be spotted with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check, and list the names of individual outlaws that have passed through. They also make reference to something called &ldquo;the Monastery of the Distressed Body&rdquo; and its &ldquo;Grand Master,&rdquo; who supposedly offers shelter and protection to all those who submit to their authority.</p>
<p>Additional symbols also mark out the correct route through the labyrinthine tunnels to area C1. If those markings are deciphered with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check, the characters can traverse the tunnels in a few hours. Otherwise, it takes a day or more to reach the cliff edge, and the characters face a greater number of potential random encounters as a prelude to arriving at the monastery. See appendix A for more information.</p>

For lower-level parties, you can adjust the adventure as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: Mission to the Barrier Peaks:</strong> Make sure the party has at least two of the NPCs with them. Then downplay those NPCs' secret agendas as needed to increase their party loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Monastery of the Distressed Body:</strong> For encounters built around five monks led by an elder monk, use three monks led by an elder monk instead. You can also limit those attending any audience in the central abbey to just the elder monks.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: The Ooze-Flooded City:</strong> Adjust the ooze-folk so that <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> of those defenders activate only every 20 minutes, and within 50 to 100 feet of the characters.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix D: Magic Items:</strong> As a reminder, many items listed in the appendix—even though thematic to the adventure—are not level appropriate. The appendix offers advice for limiting their use.</p>

Cliff Edge</h3><blockquote>
<p>Floating hundreds of feet in the air at the center of the valley is a large island of rock. Enormous chimney-engines extend from the bottom of this island, burning with fitful, deep-red fires that appear to keep the island aloft. A series of odd structures rise from the rock, appearing almost like metallic crystals.</p>
<p>Farther down the cliff-side ledge is a flat metal dock, on which reclines a feline monstrosity with a female humanoid head—a regal gynosphinx. A matching dock is thrust out from the floating rock island across from this dock, but there is no obvious way to cross the hundreds of feet of open space between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The floating island is all that remains of the planar craft that crashed into the mountains eons ago. The force of its impact created this valley and nearly destroyed the craft. But when it tried to escape the crash site, the planar craft tore away the massive chunk of rock it was embedded into. For centuries, its damaged engines have allowed it to maintain a fixed location in the air, but they aren&rsquo;t strong enough to ascend any higher.</p>
<p>Before the characters can attempt any crossing to the monastery, they must contend with the guardian waiting for them in area C2.</p>

Enhanced Sphinx</h3><p>Sitting regally on the metallic dock, this enhanced sphinx protects the approach to the monastery. It intervenes in any attempt to fly or otherwise cross to the floating island, but negotiates for passage if the characters speak to it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The gynosphinx appears to have suffered ancient injuries to its head, which have healed and been replaced by mechanical components. Both the creature&rsquo;s eyes are now glowing blue lenses, and its head is orbited by a number of spinning metallic devices. &ldquo;Entreat with me,&rdquo; the sphinx says, &ldquo;if you wish to cross to the monastery. You do not appear entirely ignorant, and I look forward to adding whatever small knowledge you might possess to my collection.&rdquo;</p>

The sphinx&rsquo;s head is also surrounded by a series of mechanical devices that function as <wc-fetch type=item>Ioun Stone</wc-fetch>, which add to its vast knowledge. The enhanced sphinx is a Gynosphinx, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its Intelligence score is 24 (+7).</li>
<li>It has a +1 bonus to Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws.</li>
<li>It can speak and understand all languages.</li>

This could be a riddle, a secret, a logical contradiction, or any other question—but the sphinx warns the characters that with all the knowledge it has collected throughout the years, it knows the answer to every question. If it fails to answer, the characters are allowed to cross to the island without paying the toll.</p>
<p>With its enhanced knowledge, the sphinx can correctly answer almost any question. To simulate this around the table, you might challenge the players to stump you as the DM with a riddle or trivia question. This might be something inherent to their characters' own knowledge, or something completely outside the context of the game. If this is a question pertaining to the real world, you might tell the players in advance that you&rsquo;ll make use of the Internet with a 30-second time limit to mimic the sphinx&rsquo;s vast knowledge base. If this is a game-world question, you can instead let the sphinx attempt a DC 15 Intelligence check to answer the question, with advantage on the check (and look for further options in appendix B).</p>
<p>Each time the enhanced sphinx successfully answers a question, it demands that the characters pay the toll to cross: either one character&rsquo;s Intelligence score permanently decreases by 1, or two characters each have another ability score of their choice permanently decrease by 1. This toll is magically extracted immediately, and manifests as another of the sphinx&rsquo;s mechanical <wc-fetch type=item>Ioun stone</wc-fetch>-like devices. This curse can be removed only by a <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> spell cast by an 18th-level spellcaster, by defeating the enhanced sphinx in combat, or through mechanisms found in Kwalish&rsquo;s lab in Daoine Gloine (see area O7).</p>

Ferry Service</h3><p>The flying ferry is summoned from the monastery&rsquo;s dock at the sphinx&rsquo;s mental command, crossing over to the cliff ledge. The ferry also comes if the sphinx is killed, adhering to the Grand Master&rsquo;s orders that any powerful visitors are to be brought to the devil&rsquo;s attention. Alternatively, the Grand Master might send over a squad of five monks (Cultist) led by an elder monk (Cult Fanatic) to investigate the sphinx&rsquo;s death and assess the characters' potential threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pulse of fire marks something igniting at the edge of the floating island, alongside its distant dock. Something detaches and floats smoothly towards you—a flying skiff piloted by a hooded figure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ferry is operated by a Merrenoloth (originally from Mordenkainen&rsquo;s Tome of Foes). It is crafted from laboratory debris attached to a small engine similar to the large engines holding the monastery aloft. The skiff can ferry up to ten Medium creatures at one time, and can be controlled automatically by the merrenoloth, Gearbox the modron, or a rescued brain in a jar (see area M8). A character can decipher the controls of a skiff with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check, allowing that character to control it. A skiff also requires at least one fully charged energy cell from the treasury (area M10) for fuel.</p>
<p>The merrenoloth stays silent, but any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check to glimpse beneath its hood sees a skeletal face. (The character can later note the resemblance between this visage and the monastery&rsquo;s flayed monks.)</p>

Valley Floor</h3><p>If any character is unfortunate enough to fall from the cliff, the other characters quickly lose sight of them in a light mist that covers the valley floor. Any subsequent search for a body comes up empty—because a floating teleportation-field device (see the sidebar) zooms around the bottom of the valley, and automatically teleports the falling character into the prison cells at area M6.</p>

The overall sense of the place—as evidenced in the alien geometries of its buildings and its exposed technology—should be one of a brooding, otherworldly environ where nothing feels quite right.</p>
<p>Over long years, the monastery has drawn hundreds of dark recruits to its hidden location, through both whispered rumor and dark outreach to criminals seeking refuge from the law. Though the vast majority of those recruits have perished or been imprisoned at the hands of the Grand Master, twenty-five monks—all a motley assemblage of evil humanoids—currently occupy various areas of the monastery. All wear cowled robes to conceal their features, which can be seen only if a monk is forced to unmask, or if a watchful character gets close to a monk and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Any monk whose face is seen shows an identical grim countenance—a face flayed nearly to the bone, the result of a brutal initiation to better match the appearance of the Grand Master.</p>
<p>Wherever they are initially stationed, the monks all gather together if a general alarm is sounded, or to witness an audience in the central abbey (area M3). Each monk is a Cultist that carries a smaller version of a bone devil&rsquo;s hooked polearm (see the sidebar in the &ldquo;Bone Devil&rdquo; section in the Monster Manual), typically disguised as a staff or tool:</p>
<h5 id=hooked-polearm>

If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is <wc-fetch type=condition>grappled</wc-fetch> (escape DC 10). Until this grapple ends, the monk cannot use its polearm on another target.</p>
<p>In addition, each group of five monks is led by an elder monk. These are Cult Fanatic that have outfitted their polearms with laser weapons secured from the monastery&rsquo;s stores of technology. These weapons are notoriously ineffective against polished metal armor and shields, which reflect their laser bolts:</p>

Both rings channel the power of teleportation and flight, and were originally used to undertake repairs on the outside of the craft, handle dangerous substances at a distance, and so forth.</p>
<p>When a creature passes an arm or other appendage into one ring, that appendage appears to emerge from the other ring, no matter how far apart the devices are. The second device has a flying speed of 40 feet, and can be flown remotely under the creature&rsquo;s control as part of its own movement. The remote device also grants the creature a sensory awareness of the area around it. This allows the appendage to be used normally, so that the creature can undertake any activity remotely that it could accomplish close up, including making physical ability checks and attacks.</p>
<p>Because they are linked to the planar craft, teleportation-field devices function only in the monastery and in Daoine Gloine (where Kwalish has used the magical-mechanical technology of the craft to set up his new lab). If the characters manage to secure a pair of such devices, you can let the players come up with novel ways to make use of them in those locations (assigning appropriate Intelligence checks if you want to make the process difficult). However, they can&rsquo;t be claimed as treasure.</p>

As such, you might add to the ranks of the monks with any number of villainous NPCs the players have heard about, or even foes that slipped through their clutches in years past. Sir Bluto Sans Pite from White Plume Mountain in Tales from the Yawning Portal is a good candidate, as are Faroul and Gondolo from Port Nyanzaru in <em>Tomb of Annihilation</em>.</p>
<p>The monks do not interfere as the characters initially explore the monastery, and they keep their cowls down if they are approached. They say little about the workings of the place, but vaguely hint at how newcomers will be welcome to either join their &ldquo;immured brothers&rdquo; (the prisoners in area M6) or the &ldquo;enlightened ones&rdquo; (the brains in jars in the control room of area M8). They readily direct characters toward the Grand Master in the central abbey (area M3). If the monks are harassed, or if the characters spend too much time exploring on their own, Lean Meimbaol from area M1 arrives to personally escort them to the abbey.</p>
<p>If combat breaks out, the monks all reveal their true natures, and attempt to overwhelm and capture the characters.</p>

All have had their faces flayed to make them barely distinguishable from the monks. Most work in the engine room (area M5) during the day, and are penned together at night in the cells of area M6. A smaller group of more dangerous humanoids has been permanently imprisoned in that same area.</p>
<p>Several of the prisoners are survivors from previous expeditions sent into the Barrier Peaks by the Cartophile. They recognize any of the hirelings with the characters, or any other signs of the Cartophile&rsquo;s patronage (maps, notebooks, and so forth). Once contact has been made, they look to help the characters—especially if this also leads to their own escape. However, most of the other prisoners are former monks that tried to leave or otherwise got into trouble, and they look to curry favor with their captors by reporting subversive activity.</p>

Monastery Dock</h3><p>The merrenoloth&rsquo;s ferry departs from and arrives at this metallic dock. As the characters arrive, an elder monk named Lean Meimbaol greets them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A figure dressed as a hooded monk stands beside the dock, awaiting your arrival. Though he does not lower his cowl, he greets you warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations on your finding us! The Monastery of the Distressed Body remains ever open to new prospects. I am sure the Grand Master will find suitable use for your bodies&mldr; or your minds. May I take you to him now?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters agree, they are brought to the central abbey (area M3). If they demure or refuse, Lean Meimbaol does not interfere with their exploration of the monastery. However, he does issue a subtle warning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference, really. All who come here find their way to the Grand Master&mldr; eventually.&rdquo;</p>

Monastery Grounds</h3><p>At the surface level of the floating rock island, the monastery is laid out as a large campus composed of sharp-angled buildings. These jut out of the ground like massive metallic crystals, with scraggly gardens set between them and paths winding throughout. Five monks led by an elder can be found here, silently going about the business of gardening, observing prayers, scrubbing flagstones, and other mundane activities.</p>

Graffiti scratched into the walls in thieves' cant and Infernal reveals dire sentiments regarding how the doubtful are punished, and how only service to the monastery can keep it aloft. In addition, the original metal of the structures here has been melted and reworked in many places into a preponderance of leering skulls.</p>
<p>With a successful check result of 16 or higher, characters note that strange wiring runs throughout the grounds, seeming to connect all the buildings together, and originating in area M8 (the control room).</p>

Central Abbey</h3><p>Visible from across the monastery grounds, the planar craft&rsquo;s former main conning tower rises several hundred feet into the air. It now serves as the monastery&rsquo;s central abbey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A massive pair of cathedral doors open onto a long nave. Rows of balconies line the walls, occupied by a couple of dozen hooded monks seemingly come to watch the audience about to take place.</p>
<p>At the far end of the nave, a throne resembling a twisted metal captain&rsquo;s chair rises from a metallic dais backed by an ornate arch. There sits the Grand Master of the Distressed Body—a bone devil flanked by two massive bodyguards. The Grand Master wears a patchwork leather robe and a gleaming crown, and it carries a scepter set with odd crystal bumps and metal flanges. With its other hand, the devil taps the arm of the throne, showing off nails set with gleaming metallic shards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; the Grand Master says. &ldquo;We get few supplicants here of your obvious experience and skill. You shall do well in service here at the monastery. But will that service be with the strength of your bodies or the strength of your minds?&rdquo;</p>

The scepter and crown it bears appear almost mechanical in nature, and are crafted from repurposed magical-mechanical parts from the planar craft. Large rings seemingly crafted in the same way encircle the devil&rsquo;s arms and tail.</p>
<p>If a monk escorted the characters here, the Grand Master makes an example of that servitor for allowing weapons to be brought into its holy presence. Otherwise, the Grand Master is making an example of a random monk when the characters enter this area. In either event, the devil&rsquo;s elder monk bodyguards (see below) are ordered to strike with their exotic weapons, executing the errant monk while the Grand Master welcomes the characters.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span>
</p>
<p>The bone devil is an arrogant bully, and assumes that the characters have come to join its cult. However, it also comes across as whiny and petulant, reliant on the protection of its bodyguards rather than making any physical threats. If asked about Kwalish, the Grand Master gladly recounts how it took over the floating island and drove Kwalish to a second location—some lost city farther into the Barrier Peaks.</p>
<p>The devil has seen Kwalish&rsquo;s notes (found in the treasury, area M10), which confirm that the inventor was intent on seeking the legendary city of Daoine Gloine. It offers to let the characters see them as well—in exchange for the &ldquo;modest fee&rdquo; of all the characters' magic items, and one year of service from either the strongest or most intelligent character. (The devil is always in need of fresh servants to shovel fuel in the engine room, and fresh minds to replace the brains in the control room.) If the characters reject this offer, the Grand Master demands a year of service simply for the honor of the characters having visited the monastery, after which they are free to leave.</p>
<p>Any characters foolish enough to volunteer their service are taken to the leather works (area M7) to have their faces flayed. As soon as those characters are out of the abbey, the Grand Master orders the other adventurers to be murdered and looted. If it is attacked or its orders are openly defied, the bone devil orders the characters attacked at once. The Grand Master fights only if directly threatened, or if its bodyguards and monks appear to be losing the fight.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shards of a <wc-fetch type=item>Vorpal Sword</wc-fetch> once broken against the devil replace its claws. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check identifies them as such. When the devil rolls a 20 on an attack roll with a claw, the target is decapitated. (At your option, the attack can instead deal an extra <wc-roll>6d8</wc-roll> slashing damage.) A target is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, has legendary actions, doesn&rsquo;t have or need a head, or if you decide that the target is too large for its head to be cut off by the devil&rsquo;s claws. If removed, the shards lose their magical powers.</li>
<li>Local teleportation-field bracelets encircle the devil&rsquo;s arms and tail. These devices allow the Grand Master to make its claw and sting attacks remotely, though still on the devil&rsquo;s turn and using its actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two half-orc monks named East Wind and West Wind protect the Grand Master at all times. Each is a Martial Arts Adept with these changes:</p>

<p>The Grand Master makes for a difficult fight on its own, and the addition of bodyguards and monks targeting characters from the balconies could quickly overwhelm a party. You might opt to have the Grand Master reveal some of the workings of the monastery through its boasting—specifically, the existence of the treasury and the brains in jars guarding its access. Doing so might encourage characters to escape in that direction during the commotion of a fight.</p>

The original bone devil met its demise after Kwalish&rsquo;s exile, when it was drawn into the laboratory&rsquo;s machinery while trying to convert the planar craft into the monastery. This rendered the devil into the treasury&rsquo;s brain in a jar. In the aftermath, the Grand Master&rsquo;s servant Whazzit discovered Kwalish&rsquo;s war machine designs and managed to construct it using the bone devil&rsquo;s exoskeleton. The tiny fiend has kept up this pretense for years, piloting this exoskeleton in the guise of the Grand Master. If the Grand Master&rsquo;s true nature is discovered, the quasit immediately surrenders and any remaining monks quickly and chaotically revolt. They&rsquo;ll begin looting, abandon work in the engine room, and eventually attempt to flee.</p>

<p>This massive chamber is filled with the deafening hum and roar of machinery. Piles of rough rock ore are spread throughout the area, around which a prisoner work gang toils in the sweltering heat. Smooth metallic columns rise to the ceiling, with open hatches set into their sides at ground level. Haggard prisoners frantically shovel ore into these hatches, which pulse with a deep-red glow. As you watch, a prisoner collapses from <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>. Under orders from the overseeing monks, other workers toss his body out of the way into a corner for a quick and callous disposal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fuel originally carried by the planar craft has long been exhausted, and prisoners now shovel low-grade ore mined from the surrounding mountains into the furnaces beneath this area. The powerful fires of those furnaces keep the monastery in the air, and instantly destroy anything thrown into their open vents.</p>
<p>If ore ceases to be fed to the furnaces (most likely due to the characters freeing the prisoners here and breaking the Grand Master&rsquo;s power) the engines begin to fail over a 24-hour period.

Countless wires twist their way across the walls, erupting from control panels that have been pulled apart to lay bare their internal components. Five clear canisters connected by metal tubing and wires line the walls, each one filled with viscous fluid—and what appears to be a humanoid brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any wires spotted by the characters in area M2 all eventually end up here. An inspection of the room and its control panels show that most of the magical-mechanical components once here have been stripped out. These were worked into Kwalish&rsquo;s original experiments or otherwise repurposed.</p>

Working together, the brains maintain the monastery&rsquo;s technical operations. Each brain is also responsible for two of the floating disks that lead out to the treasury (see area M9, &ldquo;Floating Bridge&rdquo;), each of which is kept active by default.</p>
<p>Each brain speaks Common and another language of your choice, and is able to communicate from within its canister. Some identify themselves as members of Kwalish&rsquo;s original expedition, while others are wizards and other spellcasters enslaved by the monks.</p>

All of Kwalish&rsquo;s companions died at the hands of the sphinx, but the inventor managed to harvest their brains in order to return them to a semblance of life. Kwalish promised to research a means of finding new bodies for his fallen companions, but was driven away by the Grand Master before he could complete this task. The brains suspect that Kwalish traveled onward to Daoine Gloine, and though they don&rsquo;t know the route, they do know that Kwalish&rsquo;s journal from their original expedition can be found in the treasury (area M10).</p>
<p>If the check result is 14 or higher, the characters also learn that the brains have control over the floating disks leading to the treasury, and that they are ordered to deactivate the disks if anyone other than the Grand Master attempts to cross them. They also reveal the existence of the <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> surrounding the treasury (see area M10 for more information).</p>
<p>If the check result is 16 or higher, the characters learn of a final, more powerful brain sequestered within the treasury. However, the brains in this area can only speculate on who that brain once belonged to, its state of mind, and what it controls.</p>

However, the brains can be <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>, intimidated, cajoled, or negotiated with to keep their floating disks active. If the characters negotiate poorly, or if any brains are destroyed, certain disks deactivate—and reaching the treasury becomes a greater challenge.</p>
<p>In order to persuade the brains to keep all the floating disks active, the characters must succeed on five DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) checks. Any character proficient in these skills can attempt a check or use the <wc-fetch type=action>Help</wc-fetch> action to provide advantage on another character&rsquo;s check. For each failure, one brain deactivates both its disks.</p>
<p>If the players enjoy extended dialog and more social encounters, you can have them interact with each brain separately. With a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check, a character talking to a brain discovers its specific knowledge (see the table below), including which skill has the best chance to convince a brain to keep its disks active. If that check is subsequently failed, both of that specific brain&rsquo;s disks are deactivated.</p>
<p>If brain number 2 or any three other brains are destroyed or disconnected, the monastery&rsquo;s systems begin to fail over a 24-hour period. When those systems fail completely after that point, the monastery plunges into the valley to be destroyed, along with any creatures still inside it.</p>

Successfully doing so overrides all the brains in jars and keeps all the floating disks active. However, doing so instills Gearbox with a greater sense of purpose, after which it refuses to disconnect. The modron thereafter integrates its consciousness into the monastery&rsquo;s, running its systems as its new integrated mind.</p>

Floating Bridge</h3><p>The route to the treasury takes characters out across a series of ten magical floating disks—all of which are suspended hundreds of feet in the open air above the valley floor. All the disks are kept active by default, unless they are specifically deactivated by one of the brains in jars in area M8. Each disk is identical to the effect created by a <wc-fetch type=spell>Tenser&rsquo;s floating disk</wc-fetch> spell—a circular, horizontal plane of force 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick. The disks are set in a line and spaced 5 feet apart. If any disks are deactivated, a not-insignificant leap is required to cross the empty space between them.</p>

It is held aloft on its own sputtering engine, and is largely filled with a heaping, tangled mass of wreckage. This consists of old machine parts from other areas of the monastery, broken relics of Kwalish&rsquo;s earliest experiments, dead energy cells, and the like.</p>
<p>The controls that operate the antimagic field are set into a wall and completely hidden behind a pile of junk. More piles of junk hide the monastery&rsquo;s treasure, including the journal from Kwalish&rsquo;s original expedition—and a final brain in a jar.</p>

It is in charge of the treasury engine, with its canister housed atop the actual engine mounting, rendering it immobile. While investigating the laboratory workings in this area, the devil inadvertently found its brain magically drawn into the jar, where it remains desperate to be reunited with its body.</p>
<p>As with the other brains in jars, this brain can be negotiated with. If a character succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check, the brain warns them of the risks of tampering with the journal (see below). It then negotiates for the characters' aid, claiming that only it can safely release the journal—but offering to do so only in exchange for a body. Specifically, it demands that the body of the defeated Grand Master be brought to this area. If this is done, the brain can use the laboratory&rsquo;s equipment to return to its original body. Instead of being thankful, however, the devil turns against the characters at the first opportunity.</p>

A successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check confirms that these are not just decorative, but appear to be set in some sort of working order. The same check reveals that wires lead from the journal into another pile of junk, behind which stands the canister of the final brain in a jar.</p>
<p>If the journal is removed from this area, has its wires cut, or is opened, the gears on the cover deactivate the treasury engine, which begins to sputter. The characters have 3 rounds to flee this area before the treasury plunges down into the valley to be destroyed, along with any creatures still inside it.</p>
<p>The journal can be safely opened by the brain in a jar, or with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Its pages detail how Kwalish continued his research into finding Daoine Gloine even after setting up his initial laboratory on the floating island. Using the notes and maps contained in the journal, the characters can find a route through the Barrier Peaks to Daoine Gloine. In addition, the journal provides plentiful evidence of Kwalish&rsquo;s fascination with extradimensional spaces, and talks about his hope of one day establishing a secure sanctum &ldquo;beyond the bounds of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The components and notes left behind by Kwalish are also of potential value to the characters. These include instructions and raw materials for crafting artificial bodies for the brains in jars, constructing a flying craft useful for escaping the monastery and further exploration of the mountains, building an ambulatory craft capable of crawling up and down mountainous slopes to travel farther into the Barrier Peaks, and other tasks of your devising. Completing any such project requires a successful DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check or Dexterity check using thieves' tools or tinker&rsquo;s tools.</p>
<p>Alongside countless dead energy cells spread across this area, the characters find <wc-roll>1d6 + 4</wc-roll> charged cells, each holding 20 charges. These are useful for powering the elder monks' force pikes, or for temporarily powering a brain in a jar&rsquo;s canister so it can be detached from the monastery&rsquo;s power and moved elsewhere. Energy cells might also be used in devices the characters create (see above) or in the <em>powered armor</em> found in area O7. Energy cells cannot be recharged.</p>

These passes and trails lead to the legendary lost city after a journey of several weeks. Alternatively, the characters might want to use the technology found in the monastery to expedite the journey. A bit of bargaining—or theft—might gain the party the use of the merrenoloth&rsquo;s skiff. Or the characters could make use of Kwalish&rsquo;s notes to shape the components and energy cells of the treasury into a walking or flying vehicle. The use of a skiff or constructed vehicle cuts down the time it takes to reach Daoine Gloine, as you determine.</p>
<p>To reduce the travel time to the lost city to nothing, you might have Kwalish&rsquo;s notes provide instructions for reopening the planar archway in area M3. Instead of leading to the Nine Hells, the inventor&rsquo;s instructions open a gate directly to area O1 of Daoine Gloine.</p>

Hidden in the treasury of the monastery are further notes and lore that let the characters push on to Daoine Gloine. But you can easily reverse that setup by having the Cartophile&rsquo;s lore lead the characters straight to Daoine Gloine—with the lost city set up as the site of Kwalish&rsquo;s first lab. Kwalish isn&rsquo;t there, but old lore and notes talk of how he was driven from the area by the ooze, and allow the characters to reach the monastery. There, Kwalish can be found as the final brain in a jar in the treasury (area M10). Alternatively, the Cartophile&rsquo;s material might lead the characters to the monastery, but also reveal caverns that continue past and provide a route straight to Daoine Gloine. Taking that route to find Kwalish in the city, the characters are asked by the inventor to help purge the monastery of the Grand Master and finally reunite the brains in jars with new bodies.</p>
