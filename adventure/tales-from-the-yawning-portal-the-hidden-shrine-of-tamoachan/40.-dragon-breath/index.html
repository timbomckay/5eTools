<blockquote>
<p>A staircase leads upward into the gloom. It seems as though you have found the entrance to another layer within the complex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second 10-foot square along these stairs is warded by magic like that of a <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 17). If the glyph is triggered, nothing happens until a creature moves onto the uppermost 5 feet of the stairs. When that occurs, a stone statue of a dragon, hidden in the secret room at the top of the stairs (see the &ldquo;Second Tier&rdquo; portion of the map), pops out and rolls forward to the head of the steps. The statue has the statistics, defenses, and traits of a stone golem, but it has no action options. As soon as it stops after emerging, it opens its mouth and breathes a gust of steam 30 feet long and 10 feet wide. Those in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d4+2) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

</span>
</p>
<p>Thereafter, the statue breathes the next three times someone moves into or through the warded area. After four breaths, the statue retreats to its room and the door closes. (The statue&rsquo;s resting place is connected to a hot water geyser in the bedrock, through which it replenishes itself.)</p>

The door can&rsquo;t be opened from the outside, however.</p>

<p>At the western end of this corridor is a pile of golden coins heaped on the floor. On top of the gold rests a skull missing its lower jaw. In the right eye socket, a black spider has made a home. Several bones are piled with the coins, and the hilt of a broken sword thrusts up from the mass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This apparent pile of gold is covered with a pale yellow dust. The entire pile of coins is actually <wc-fetch type=hazard>yellow mold</wc-fetch> covered by a permanent <wc-fetch type=spell>major image</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 15). The bones, spider, and sword hilt are real.</p>

Because of this clue, it takes only a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find the secret door. The door can be opened by stepping forcibly upon an obvious cobblestone that is slightly raised from the floor. The door has two facing panels that pivot inward when it is opened.</p>

This door swings on a horizontal pivot in the middle of the slab. Pushing in at either the top or the bottom of this secret panel causes the opposite end to swing outward, providing enough space to crawl through into the secret passage beyond.</p>

The Chapel of Kukulkan</h2><p><em>(Koo-KOOL-kahn, the feathered serpent)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the secret door, the passage bends around to the left. At the end of a narrow corridor hangs an ornate mirror, and a door is set in the eastern wall next to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=magic-mirror>
<a href=#magic-mirror class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Magic Mirror</h3><p>The first creature to come within 10 feet of the mirror at the end of the corridor must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed check, the creature believes that it is in deadly combat with a feathered warrior that has emerged from the mirror. This effect is like that of a phantasmal force spell, with the character battling a warrior that has a +6 bonus to hit and deals 3 (1d6) psychic damage, as described in the spell. The effect ends if the affected creature deals the imaginary warrior a total amount of damage equal to the creature&rsquo;s own hit point maximum.</p>
<p>While under the effect of this magic, the creature is actually paralyzed, appearing to others as if it were just standing there staring into the mirror. If someone disturbs the affected creature, that creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The door seems to be very heavy, and it has many glyphs carved upon it. In the center of the door is carved an eagle killing a serpent. Two stone warriors dressed in loincloths and wearing panther masks are sculpted into the door posts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The glyphs on the door tell a story in ancient Olman of a journey to find truth and light, which ended in failure and imprisonment in the land of the dead.</p>
<p>The door opens outward. When the characters pass through the doorway, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the door is a wide foyer that leads into a circular room. On the south wall of this hall is a jade death mask affixed at chest height.</p>
<p>Taking up the middle of the chamber is a cross-shaped dais with sets of stairs leading up to it along each of the four ends. In the center of the dais rises a cylindrical structure that appears to be made of transparent walls of crystal enclosing an oddly carved, stone pillar.</p>
<p>The stairs that face the room&rsquo;s entrance are carved with the heads of many gods. The steps on the north side are bloodstained, and atop the landing stands a statue of a warrior. The stairs to the east, across the room, are partly obscured by shadow. The southern staircase is luminescent, appearing to change colors in the light.</p>
<p>Tucked into each nook where the arms of the cross come together is a low shelf on which are placed small offerings: silver bracelets, earrings, neck collars, anklets, piles of coral beads, and silver and jade statuettes.</p>

If the mask is taken off the wall, the lever it hangs on pivots up and three sets of iron bars drop, caging whoever is in the square in front of the mask. The bars are old, and they can be bent or lifted away from the floor with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>

Because of its especially potent Shielded Mind trait, it is effectively invisible.</p>
<p>If the characters disturb any of the items on the shelves, the couatl speaks to the party in Common, its voice seeming to come from everywhere in the chamber.</p>

<p>There is actually no poison gas in the room, but as the characters spend time in here trying to get to the cure, describe how they seem to be getting weaker and weaker. They should feel as if time is running out.</p>

<p>A character who attempts to reach the dais another way has no luck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone who tries climbing up the shelves takes 2 (1d4) force damage and is pushed back 10 feet.</li>
<li>The heads carved into the western stairs babble when a character steps on them. That character feels too weak to continue, and sits down until helped away from the stairs.</li>
<li>The eastern stairs are shrouded in dim light, which can&rsquo;t be made brighter by any means. Any character who mounts the stairs falls down and rolls back onto the floor, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li>The southern stairs change color constantly. Anyone who tries to ascend them makes no progress (though they can be descended normally).</li>

<p>The surface of the crystal cylinder is cold to the touch and impervious to all blows. The enclosure has no visible gaps.</p>
<p>A gap appears in the wall if someone who has proficiency with thieves' tools touches the tools to the surface with the intention of finding a portal or a lock. The players might come up with other valid solutions, such as a wizard (clever person) touching the crystal with a wand (tool). It&rsquo;s up to you which alternative attempts work.</p>

The Smoking Mirrors</h2><blockquote>
<p>An amber haze drifts in this room, which is unoccupied. Strangely shaped and colored mirrors hang on the walls, and a large, oblong stone basin stands in the middle of the floor. The basin is about ten feet long, five feet wide, and three feet tall. It is filled with a steaming golden liquid.</p>
<p>The red mirror on the eastern wall seems to be composed of fiery glass and framed in bronze. Light beams are broken by the mirror into myriad flames, and ghostly shapes seem to flicker in its depths.</p>
<p>On the northern wall are two mirrors: a striking black one of obsidian framed in lacquered wood, and a stark white mirror with a wrought iron frame. The black mirror has a distinctive earthy odor and the blackness of subterranean caverns, but it seems of crude construction and reflects objects only when they are close to it. The white mirror has a pungent odor of nutmeg and spice, and its depths are gelid and smoky.</p>
<p>The mirror that hangs on the western wall is in a stone frame and is blue in color. Reflections in this mirror ripple as if the viewer were looking into a pool of water.</p>

Within 1 round, the speed is too great for the victim to maintain footing, and the creature is dragged and bashed about, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature that comes free while the altar is spinning tumbles away from it and takes another 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p>The gem in the center of the altar has AC 17 and 15 hit points. If it is destroyed, the altar stops spinning and the character is released. The gem is a cursed stone, but it appears to be a jewel of value, and it can be pried from the altar. If the gem comes in contact with a creature&rsquo;s flesh, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by an Otto&rsquo;s irresistible dance spell, going into a spinning dance that lasts until the stone is released. To let go of the stone willingly, the creature must be the target of magic that removes a curse or breaks an enchantment.</p>
<p>If the creature dances for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>.

Mictlan</h2><p><em>(Meek-TLAN, Land of the Dead)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room is decorated with a bizarre diorama depicting the land of the dead. Small, brightly painted clay statues have been placed about the room to represent the inhabitants of this realm and the unfortunate people they have taken into their care.</p>
<p>In the center of the room, the floor rises to form a small hill. A group of small figures seem to be struggling to roll a boulder up the hill, while a devil drives them on. Above the hill in the ceiling is a glowing spot that illuminates the entire chamber with an eerie silver light.</p>
<p>A cobblestone path leads from the western door to the foot of the hill. A similar path runs eastward and then veers south. Sections of the diorama around the perimeter of the room depict different environments in the land of the dead.</p>
<p>In the western end of the room is a region of burning sands. There devils torture those who have been unfortunate enough to fall into their hands.</p>
<p>Along the southern side is a grassy plain where people frolic and hunt antelope and deer.</p>
<p>North of the grassy plain and south of the hill, the floor opens into a model of a canyon. A river of lava flows down it while flames lick the walls. East of the hill, in a side area of the room, is a counterpart to this fiery canyon-an icy waste.</p>
<p>To the north of the hill is a putrid, bubbling marsh where figures strive to keep their heads above the surface.</p>
<p>From out of the marsh a black, torpid river wends its way past the northern edge of the hill and flows west to pour over the lip of a steam-filled chasm in the northwest comer of the room. Within this dark chasm, worms pursue the fleeing forms of naked people.</p>
<p>In the south comer of the room on the eastern wall is a barred door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The light in the ceiling comes from the walls of a chute that glows in the dark. The chimney can be reached by someone who climbs on the shoulders of another character, but to enter it, the character must brace back and legs against opposite walls because there are no protuberances to hold onto. The steeply inclined passage beyond is full of cobwebs and leads eventually to <strong>area 48</strong>.</p>
<p>Each section of the diorama in this room has a magical aspect that affects any creatures that walk into the region. If the effect isn&rsquo;t instantaneous and isn&rsquo;t related to a spell, it can be dispelled with dispel magic cast as a 5th-level spell (or at a level stated in the effect). A creature on which a region&rsquo;s effect is dispelled is immune to the effect for 1 minute.</p>
<p>The two paths are free of magical effects. If characters veer off the paths, either unwittingly or with the intent of exploring, apply the effects described below according to the areas they enter. Unless otherwise noted, creatures can leave an area whenever they desire, by either moving onto one of the paths or into an adjacent area.</p>

<p>Also, a creature in the chute struck by the spider must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (player&rsquo;s choice). On a failed save, the creature slips down the chute 5 feet for every point by which the saving throw failed. If a creature falls 30 feet, it plummets out of the chute, taking falling damage accordingly and rolling in a random direction (roll a d4) after landing prone in <strong>area 45</strong>.
