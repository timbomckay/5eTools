<p>Ages ago, the vicious warlord Dalk Dranzorg ravaged the countryside at the head of a bandit army. After conquering the lands of Count Cordon Silvra, he took the lord&rsquo;s fortress, Castle Laventz, as his own.</p>
<p>Months later, the relentless knight Mara Silvra received word of her father&rsquo;s defeat. Calling in debts and intimidating mercenaries, Mara forged a small army during her grueling march home. Upon arriving, she expected to find her homeland&rsquo;s nobility ready to rise to her cause, but they&rsquo;d been cowed and terrified by reports of Dranzorg entombing captives and rivals in his castle&rsquo;s walls. Calling them cowards, Mara drove her troops harshly on, suffering daily ambushes and desertions. When Castle Laventz finally came into view, Mara led less than a dozen irresolute knights. Shouting her frustrations into the night, Mara was answered by a voice from the shadows. This sinister force would give her the power to take back her home and rule her lands, but she would never leave Castle Laventz again. Without hesitation, Mara accepted the arrangement. In the same instant, Dranzorg&rsquo;s troops swept in and took Mara and her knights captive.</p>
<p>Within the castle, Dranzorg showed Mara and her followers the hollow walls where they&rsquo;d be buried alive. Mara&rsquo;s troops pleaded for their lives. Wickedly, the warlord promised to spare them if they watched their leader&rsquo;s entombment and spread the tale of her failure. As they agreed, Mara unleashed her rage with a supernatural, ear-bloodying scream. She slew Dranzorg barehanded and then, taking up his axe, felled the warlord&rsquo;s troops and her own traitorous followers.</p>
<p>Soon after, local nobles received invitations to come to Castle Laventz and celebrate Mara&rsquo;s victory. When each aristocrat arrived, though, they discovered they were the sole guests within a crimson-stained castle. Passing judgment on each noble for abandoning her family, Mara bricked them into her castle&rsquo;s walls. Rumors swiftly spread of Mara&rsquo;s vengeance and the castle whose walls cried. Mara was never seen again, and Castle Laventz came to be called the Castle of Lament.</p>
<p>Centuries passed, and Castle Laventz fell to ruins. Eventually, the successful merchant Loren Halvhrest purchased the land. By then, only one of Castle Laventz&rsquo;s towers remained. The frugal Halvhrest incorporated the tower into the construction of a lavish manor for his family. The Halvhrests lived peacefully in their new home for several years before mysteriously vanishing. Those who investigated found no trace of the family but were deeply unsettled by the house. Grim tales rapidly resurfaced, providing the roots for all manner of ghastly tales and a new name for the structure: the House of Lament.</p>

You should read an entire adventure before attempting to run it. If you&rsquo;d prefer to play this adventure, you shouldn&rsquo;t read any further or you risk spoiling it.</p>
<p>The Monster Manual contains statistics for many of the creatures found in this adventure. When a creature&rsquo;s name appears in <strong>bold</strong> type, that&rsquo;s a visual cue pointing you to the creature&rsquo;s stat block in the Monster Manual. If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure&rsquo;s text tells you so.</p>

At the door, they meet investigators who invite them to participate in an exploration of the building. As the party initially surveys the house, it manifests subtle hauntings. The characters are then invited to participate in the first of several sÃ©ances, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the house.</p>
<p>Depending on the spirit summoned during the sÃ©ance, the characters learn about one of the tragedies that transpired in the house. Additional sÃ©ances and discoveries ultimately wake the collective spirits and sinister forces lurking in the manor, trapping the characters inside the house. Escape requires the party to defeat an ageless evil. If they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll become another group of lost spirits imprisoned within the House of Lament.</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t rush to reveal its terrors, though. Rather, its history, threats, and phantasmal inhabitants reveal themselves gradually and in a variety of ways. Before leading your adventurers into the house, familiarize yourself with the varied ways the house&rsquo;s hauntings manifest.</p>
<h3 id=the-houses-domain>
<a href=#the-houses-domain class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The House&rsquo;s Domain</h3><p>The House of Lament is both a domain and a Darklord, a collective of tortured spirits trapped within a single structure. The majority of these shades are nothing more than faint, rageful impressions, but a few powerful personalities remain. These remnants belonged to inhabitants of the house, desperate individuals like Mara Silvra and Dalk Dranzorg. Fractured and angry, the collective spirits within the house brood amid bitter dreams. Yet when strangers enter the domain, the spirits gradually wake, energizing the one instinct they share: to add to the number of souls bound within the house&rsquo;s walls.</p>
<p>The House of Lament is capable of imposing itself over other lands and can appear in other Domains of Dread. A version of the house stands in western Borca (see chapter 3), and the structure can be accessed there no matter where else it appears. The house travels at the whims of the Dark Powers and might appear and linger for days or years before vanishing.</p>
<p>When the House of Lament closes the borders of its domain, a powerful thunderstorm surrounds it, bringing with it strong wind and heavy precipitation (detailed in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Anyone who braves the violent storm discovers that the Mists surround the house in all directions. The Mists affect those who enter them as described in chapter 3.</p>

More a force of nature than an individual being, the Entity is a bodiless intellect that nudges those in the domain toward wickedness. As characters explore, use the Entity as a lurking manifestation of the Dark Powers, a vague glimpse of a terror even the house&rsquo;s spirits fear.</p>

</span></p>
<p>When the party enters the house, few menaces initially present themselves. As characters explore, though, spirits gradually stir to life, transforming the house into a supernatural deathtrap. The haunting within the house has two states:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dormant.</b> When living beings arrive at the house, the haunting is dormant. During this time, the unassuming structure seems typical of an abandoned house. Impressions of past events and subtle, ambient haunts transpire during this time (see &ldquo;Ambient Haunts&rdquo;).</li>
<li><b>Awakened.</b> In the course of the adventure, the activities of the living alert the house&rsquo;s spirits. Once this occurs, the House of Lament closes the domain&rsquo;s borders, surrounds itself with the Mists, and conjures a powerful storm. Dangerous haunts occur throughout the house at this time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=waking-the-house>
<a href=#waking-the-house class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Waking the House</h4><p>The house reveals its full haunting at a dramatic moment. The adventure notes events that wake the house, many surrounding the events of the third sÃ©ance (see the following " SÃ©ances" section). Use ambient haunts and the atmosphere-building tips from earlier in this chapter to drive the adventure toward a dramatic scene where it feels appropriate for the house to reveal its full malevolence.</p>
<p>If characters prove especially persistent (or destructive), the house might wake earlier. If this occurs, the adventure&rsquo;s horror takes on a more in-your-face slasher quality, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with thatâ€”ditch the subtlety and go for wild shocks. Triggers that wake the house early include deliberate damage inflicted by its visitors and entering and then leaving area 24.</p>
<p>After waking, the House of Lament will not become dormant again for several weeks.</p>

During this time, the spirits of the house drift and sleepwalk through a structure that&rsquo;s changed radically over generations. Ambient haunts are glimpses of these phantasmal impressions. They&rsquo;re subtle and reveal themselves to only a single witness. They exist to help you develop the house&rsquo;s supernatural ambience and the spirits trapped within.</p>

Use ambient haunts whenever you please to heighten the creepiness of a situation. Avoid overuse, however. If characters experience frequent haunts, the manifestations become mundane or ignorable.</p>

They appear when a character is alone or the last one to leave a room, or they are simply imperceptible to all but one character. They never manifest for the entire group. Haunts may favor appearing for certain characters, perhaps due to Dark Gifts or backgrounds individuals possess.</p>

Choose a character at random or one who has a Dark Gift or background that makes them sensitive to visions of the past. If none of the characters sleep during a long rest, one of them experiences a waking vision that plays out like an ambient haunt. These nightmares gradually reveal details from the " Story Overview." Relate these specifics to the character experiencing the nightmare, embellishing them or presenting them as intense but half-remembered visions. Characters might witness any of the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>A warlord in a skull-shaped helmet (Dranzorg) cackles as wicked soldiers brick a captive into a stone wall.</li>
<li>A desperate knight (Mara) forces tired soldiers to march toward an ominous castle (Castle Laventz).</li>
<li>A knight (Mara) howls her frustrations into the night. Shadows rise, surrounding her in a crimson aura.</li>
<li>A screaming knight (Mara) slays a warlord (Dranzorg) and proceeds on a murderous rampage through a castle.</li>
<li>A terrified aristocrat shrieks as they&rsquo;re bricked into a stone wall by a bloody knight (Mara).</li>
</ul>
<p>Waking from a nightmare can be worse than the dream itself. Unless someone watches each character for the entirety of the time they&rsquo;re resting, the character who experiences the nightmare vanishes. Plausibly they could have wandered off in their sleep, but in truth they&rsquo;re teleported elsewhere by the house. Roll on the Nightmare Awakening table to determine where the character wakes, or choose another unsettling locale.</p>

<p>At certain times in the adventure, characters have the opportunity to commune with the House of Lament&rsquo;s spirits, contacting them directly through a series of sÃ©ances involving a spirit board (see the appendix). These sÃ©ances reveal the goals of the house&rsquo;s spirits but also determine the adventure&rsquo;s climax and how the party might ultimately escape the domain. These details are presented here for ease of reference, as the sÃ©ances occur at multiple points throughout the adventure.</p>
<p>Prior to running a sÃ©ance, choose or randomly determine which spirit the party will contact. The key spirits, the tone of their communication, and what they fixate upon include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dalk Dranzorg.</b> This manipulative murderer wants the party to trust him so they&rsquo;ll free his corpse from area 5a. He gives his name as &ldquo;Garland Kordz,&rdquo; an anagram of his actual name.</li>
<li><b>Mara Silvra.</b> This rageful spirit expresses her anger at traitors and trespassers. She urges characters to find area 31, hoping to trade their lives for her freedom from a bargain she made with the Entity.</li>
<li><b>Theodora Halvhrest.</b> The sorrowful former lady of the house hides the spirits of her children in area 24. She&rsquo;s wary of trespassers but sees them as a way to free her children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consult the " Escaping the House" section at the end of the adventure for details on the specific climaxes each spirit drives the plot toward.</p>

Narrate the start of the sÃ©ance and encourage each character to ask a question. As they do, you control how the spirits within the house respond. To do this, subtly guide the planchette on the spirit board or otherwise make the spirits' intentions known. Use the investigator who isn&rsquo;t running the sÃ©ance to ask basic questions or ease the party into engaging. Provide short, mysterious answers.</p>

The investigators invite the party to sit at the parlor table and join them in touching a planchette atop the spirit board. The lead investigator then starts the sÃ©ance, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Spirits of this house, we are strangers who come openly and without malice. We seek only to know your stories and to help you find peace. We entreat you: make your presence known.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spirits wait long enough for the characters to wonder if the ceremony worked. Then the room grows cooler, the lights dim, and the planchette moves to the word &ldquo;Greetings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the investigators asks the first question: &ldquo;Who are we speaking to?&rdquo; The spirit replies by spelling out the first name of the spirit you chose to contact (Mara, Theodora, or &ldquo;Garland&rdquo; for Dranzorg).</p>
<p>The spirits answer questions as guided by their aforementioned goals and personalities. All of them know the house&rsquo;s history and anything characters have seen or done in the house. By the end of the first sÃ©ance, the spirit conveys an unprompted message (with ellipses denoting pauses):</p>

Then read the following boxed text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following the directions in the cryptic message you received, it doesn&rsquo;t take long before they lead you from familiar roads onto a disused trail overgrown by weeds and the roots of spindly trees. A light drizzle begins to fall as you travel. As you approach a wooded crossroads, the leaden rain makes the cloaked form standing there seem all the more unreal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the characters see this same sight, though they don&rsquo;t see one another. Ask how each character reacts to what they see. Regardless, the figure responds in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The figure&rsquo;s head snaps up, glaring with piercing, yellow eyes. What you took for a cloak spreads around it, revealing itself to be a pair of mighty black wings. With one powerful motion and a blast of chill air, the wings sweep and the vague figure is gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characters have no way of knowing this for certain, but they&rsquo;ve just glimpsed a wereraven (see chapter 5). They have no way of stopping the mysterious creature.</p>
<p>Again, ask the characters how they react. Those who approach the crossroads openly see each other coming down different paths toward the intersection. The number of paths that converge here equals the number of characters.</p>

Eventually, characters will proceed along one of the paths and into this fog. Regardless of which trail they choose, those who enter the fog vanish for a moment, only to walk out of the haze a few steps from where they entered. Even if the whole party enters the fog, they soon reemerge back at the crossroads. Alternatively, you might use the Wandering the Mists table in chapter 3 to inspire other events.

Prior the party&rsquo;s arrival at the house, choose which pair of investigators meets them. Unless otherwise noted, these characters are described in the " Mist Wanderers" section of chapter 3:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alanik Ray and Arthur Sedgwick.</b> A mysterious third party hired these detectives to recover documents related to Loren Halvhrest&rsquo;s business and discover the state of his missing heirs.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Gradually the haze and brush give way, revealing a bald hilltop. There stands a grim black tower, the last defiant turret of a long-crumbled fortress. Attached to this tower is a three-story manor house, weather beaten and veined with ivy. A porch girds the house, its sagging roof sheltering a stout front door that stands open and emits a flickering light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the House of Lament. Abandoned for centuries, it was disturbed only moments ago by a pair of investigators who are in the process of bringing in their equipment for what they expect to be multiple days of exploration and study. They&rsquo;ve identified the parlor (area 3) as the base for their investigation.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t disguise their approach, one of the investigators calls out, identifies themselves, and welcomes the company. They invite the party inside to meet with their partner. Ultimately, if the party proves cooperative, the investigators offer the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>They know nothing about the messages the characters received.</li>
<li>They have heard of mysterious occurrences wherein strangers become &ldquo;lost in the Mists&rdquo; and arrive in unexpected places.</li>
<li>They likely don&rsquo;t know where the characters hail from, but offer to lead the characters to the city of Sturben in Borca after their work is complete.</li>
<li>If asked, they&rsquo;ll share that the house was last owned by the Halvhrest family, it&rsquo;s abandoned, and it has a reputation for attracting the dead.</li>
<li>They offer each party member 20 gp per day to help them explore the house and document strange phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the party accepts the investigators' offer, they acquire reliable allies. One of the investigators offers to join the party in their exploration the house. The other stays in the parlor to prepare to contact the house&rsquo;s spirits (see the " SÃ©ances" section). In the case of Rudolph van Richten, he remains in the parlor while the characters explore the house.</p>
<p>If the party rejects the investigators' offer, they stay out of the characters' way. They&rsquo;ll still invite the characters to participate in their sÃ©ances and are amenable to collaborating if characters have a change of heart. Anyone who tries to leave the grounds surrounding the House of Lament find their way barred by the Mists. Whenever they enter the haze, the Mists lead them back to the house, just as they did at the crossroads.</p>

It&rsquo;s in ill repair and the floorboards are exceptionally creaky, but the construction overall seems sturdy. The house is unlit, but abundant half-burned candles and empty lanterns appear throughout the rooms. Unless otherwise noted, ceilings inside the house are about 10 feet high, and the doors are made of stout mahogany. Any of the doors might be swollen shut, requiring a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check to open.</p>
<p>Less obviously, the structure supernaturally resists damage. While dormant, the house appears to take damage normally, though soggy woods prevent fire from spreading. After 24 hours, though, any damage to the house repairs itself. After the house wakes, damage to the structure heals immediately, accompanied by bleeding boards or glimpses of horrifying spaces beyond the woodwork.</p>
<p>Discourage characters from trying to destroy the house while it&rsquo;s dormant (the investigators oppose demolition attempts). Should the party obsessively persist in their destructiveness, the house eventually wakes to defend itself.</p>

Anyone who spends 5 minutes digging in this spot finds Dalk Dranzorg&rsquo;s cursed battleaxe Bilestongue, a <wc-fetch type=item>berserker axe</wc-fetch> (detailed in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide) embossed with excessively salivating demonic toads. Characters are unlikely to find it unless Dranzorg&rsquo;s spirit directs them here during a sÃ©ance.</p>

<p>Peeling wallpaper and a musty scent cling to the walls of this spacious foyer. A curving staircase rises from the cracked tile floor to a balcony above, keeping its distance from a darkened chandelier. Doors lead in every direction. At the room&rsquo;s center, a bronze sculpture of an antlered eagle perches atop a marble pedestal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This once-impressive entryway is dusty and choked with cobwebs. The stairs climb to the balcony above (area 13). The ceiling here rises 20 feet from the floor. The statue is attached to the pedestal, which together weigh 800 pounds.</p>

<p>Theodora Halvhrest used this room to tastefully indulge her interest in spiritualism. Wards and images here deter the house&rsquo;s spirits from entering the room unless summoned via magic or an implement such as the spirit board.</p>

Encourage the characters to offer up the planchette they found. If they don&rsquo;t, the investigator soon finds one in the room and begins preparing to conduct the first of several sÃ©ances.

<p>This tower is all that remains of Castle Laventz. Here, Dalk Dranzorg threatened to imprison Mara Silvra within the castle&rsquo;s walls. A bricked-over alcove remains, but while the house is dormant it&rsquo;s impossible to notice or access.

This part of the wall has AC 16, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Opening the alcove reveals a cramped space packed with those Mara buried in her castle&rsquo;s walls, specifically two boneless (see chapter 5) and the corpse of Dalk Dranzorg.</p>
<p>Dranzorg has the statistics of a revenant with one exception: his Rejuvenation trait restores him and the boneless after 1 minute, returning them to the alcove in this area. He wears the sinister armor and demon skull helmet he wore in life, but centuries of rust ensure they don&rsquo;t affect his statistics. Dranzorg can be permanently destroyed only if he&rsquo;s slain by Mara or a creature possessed by Mara. Consult " Tyrant&rsquo;s Escape" at the end of the adventure for details.</p>

The sound of the scream originates from above, passes any climbers, moves to the tower&rsquo;s floor, and then repeats. The effect sounds like someone repeatedly falling through the tower. This scream is an effect created by a malicious spirit called the Leaper.</p>
<p>While the house is dormant, the Leaper manifests as a sound and a powerful wind issuing from above. Any creature that climbs more than 30 feet up the tower, using the stairs or otherwise, must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is halted in its movement and can&rsquo;t climb higher due to the strong wind. On a failed save, it is thrown from the stairs and takes 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage upon landing in area 5a. The wind supernaturally prevents flying creatures from rising more than 30 feet.</p>

Conservatory</h3><blockquote>
<p>Desiccated vines sprawl across the tables and foggy glass walls of this conservatory. Rusted gardening tools and pots of barren soil lie scattered across sturdy wooden tables.</p>

<p>This indoor greenhouse was Theodora Halvhrest&rsquo;s pride and joy.</p>
<h5 id=ambient-haunt>
<a href=#ambient-haunt class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Ambient Haunt</h5><p>The first time any character enters this room (whether the house is dormant or awakened), a vision plays out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between eyeblinks, the conservatory is alive and filled with flowers. A transparent woman with a veiled hat and parasol strolls through the room. She pauses here and there to admire a bloom or adjust a pot, and then looks toward you. As suddenly as she appeared, she vanishes, and the room lies in ruin once more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This illusory vision provides a glimpse of Theodora Halvhrest. Characters might recognize her if they&rsquo;ve seen the portraits in areas 18 or 22. The illusion is harmless, and the characters can&rsquo;t disrupt it.</p>
<h5 id=haunted-trap>
<a href=#haunted-trap class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Haunted Trap</h5><p>When the scene ends, a haunted trap with a +2 Haunt Bonus activates (see &ldquo;Haunted Traps&rdquo; earlier in this chapter). Any creature in the room with a passive <wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch> score of 12 or higher notices rusty gardening tools levitating from the tables and floors. Those who notice can take an action. After this, the haunted trap activates. Numerous troughs and gardening implements lance through the room. Every creature in the room is targeted by a ranged attack with a +2 bonus. A target that is hit takes 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) piercing damage and must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Those who fail are <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> and begin suffocating as black vines erupt from their clothes and mouths then tighten around their bodies. Any creature adjacent to an affected creature can remove the vines by spending an action and succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.</p>
<p>After the trap activates, cracks run through the conservatory&rsquo;s windows. The fractures form the word &ldquo;Uninvited.&rdquo;</p>
<h5 id=belladonna>

It can be useful in completing the symbol of Ezra that appears on the door to area 24.</p>

Ballroom</h3><blockquote>
<p>Broken boards mar the weblike design worked into this ballroom&rsquo;s wooden floor. A short stage for long-departed musicians stands at the room&rsquo;s far end, overlooked by cracked stained-glass windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Halvhrests held delightful gatherings here, never knowing that Warlord Dranzorg&rsquo;s audience hall previously occupied the same space.</p>
<h5 id=ambient-haunt-1>
<a href=#ambient-haunt-1 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Ambient Haunt</h5><p>This haunting captures one side of an exchange between Dalk Dranzorg and his captives after he took Mara Silvra and her knights prisoner. The haunting occurs only once during the adventure. When two or more characters enter the room for the first time, read the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hollow, mocking voice reaches you, echoing as if from far away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a simple choice, my misguided knights. You can join Lady Silvra, and I&rsquo;ll entomb you all within my fortress&rsquo;s walls. Or forsake your commander, bear witness to her execution, and then walk free to tell all of Dranzorg&rsquo;s justice. My mercy knows but a moment, friends. Choose!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask each player how or if their character responds, as if they were the knights in question. Following this, an ear-splitting shriek fills the room, affecting each character in the area in one of the following ways corresponding to their reaction:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Join Lady Silvra or Belligerence.</b> Characters who say they&rsquo;ll join Lady Silvra or who taunt the voice hear the scream but aren&rsquo;t affected by it. Instead, one of the stained-glass windows on the stage cracks. The fractures look like the character as if they were trapped within the glass.</li>
<li><b>Forsake Lady Silvra or Silence.</b> Those who say they&rsquo;ll abandon Lady Silvra or who stay silent must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the character&rsquo;s ears bleed until the end of their next turn.</li>
<li><b>Channel Divinity.</b> If a character uses the Channel Divinity class feature, treat this manifestation as a haunted trap with a +4 Haunt Bonus. If the character&rsquo;s Channel Divinity disables the haunted trap, the scream that follows sounds distant and weak. The sound is harmless and thereafter the room is normal. If the haunted trap wouldn&rsquo;t be disabled, treat this as belligerence.</li>
</ul>

Kitchen</h3><blockquote>
<p>A rack previously suspended from this kitchen&rsquo;s ceiling has crashed, crushing a table and scattering rusted pots and cooking implements. A sizable iron stove is built into the north wall. Several doors lead from the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kitchen of the Halvhrest home now lies in shambles. The debris and broken furnishings make the entire area difficult terrain.</p>
<h5 id=oven>

The racks can be removed, creating enough space to admit a Medium or smaller creature, but the chimney is too narrow to climb. Anyone who opens the oven finds a warm caramel chip muffin sitting inside, a gift from the Chimney Witch.</p>
<h5 id=chimney-witch>

The Chimney Witch is a chaotic being that hungers equally for the house&rsquo;s destruction and living creaturesâ€”particularly Small or smaller creatures. The witch makes its influence known through the hearths connected to the chimney, which include the oven in this area, the bathroom (area 17) and nursery (area 23) fireplaces, and the chimney&rsquo;s top near the widow&rsquo;s walk (area 25). The witch acts subtly while the house is dormant but becomes aggressive after it&rsquo;s awakened. The Chimney Witch can perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Baleful Baker.</b> The Chimney Witch can manifest a single baked good once per hour. Icing on the pastry might form one letter or a similar design. The witch&rsquo;s baked goods are delicious but sometimes have tiny, harmless surprises hidden withinâ€”perhaps a key the party overlooked, a fingertip, or a twitching lizard tail.</li>
<li><b>Witch Fingers.</b> The Chimney Witch can manifest a claw that reaches from the chimney on a gaunt, too-many-elbowed arm once per hour. As an action, the witch can make a melee attack with a +3 bonus against a target it can see within 10 feet of one of the hearths. If hit, a target takes 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) piercing damage and is pulled into the nearest hearth.</li>
<li><b>Witch Fire.</b> The Chimney Witch can use an action to cause a roaring fire to blaze in one of its hearths once per hour. Any creature that starts its turn inside a blazing hearth or that enters an ignited oven or fireplace for the first time on a turn takes 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) fire damage. The flames vanish after 1 minute.</li>
<li><b>Manifestation.</b> After the house is awakened, the Chimney Witch can spend an action to summon a specter in one of its hearths once per day. The specter looks like a burned hag with flailing, overly long arms. If the specter is defeated, the Chimney Witch cannot perform any actions and remains silent for 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chimney Witch wants to see the House of Lament destroyed, hoping that will free it from the chimney. It might aid the party in defeating the house&rsquo;s other powerful spirits but grows agitated if ignored. Use the spirit to provide subtle hints to the party as necessary and to make Small creatures wary of the house&rsquo;s fireplaces.</p>
<p>If, during a sÃ©ance, Mara sends the characters to &ldquo;evict&rdquo; the Chimney Witch, the witch summons a specter. Defeating it satisfies Mara&rsquo;s request.</p>

It&rsquo;s in fine condition and looks as if it&rsquo;s been oiled regularly.</p>
<p>Any character who touches the harp must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to play it. A character compelled to play must make a DC 16 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Performance</wc-fetch>) check. If the character succeeds, they spend the next minute flawlessly playing a fast-paced, glass-sharp tune they&rsquo;ve never heard before. If the character fails, they play the song brilliantly, but cut themselves messily on the harp strings, taking <wc-roll>1d2</wc-roll> slashing damage at the start of each of their turns for 1 minute. The character can&rsquo;t stop playing, but another creature can yank them away from the harp by succeeding on a DC 12 Strength check. After this, the harp ceases to compel characters to play it.</p>
<p>Anyone compelled to play the harp learns the song <em>Blood-Tears of Claveria</em>, knows it was written by the composer Lyron Evensong, and has advantage on subsequent Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Performance</wc-fetch>) checks made to play the chilling tune on any instrument.</p>

<p>This room belonged to Agatha Kavenza, the nursemaid of Regan and Vastion Halvhrest. A devotee of the god Ezra, Agatha decorated her room with a plaque of her god&rsquo;s symbol, a shield crossed with a spring of belladonna. This displays the missing part of the symbol that appears in area 23. Agatha hid herself here when spirits overwhelmed the house. Her fate is unknown, but a series of long scratches and broken fingernails end at a conspicuous bag on the floor. This is a <wc-fetch type=item>bag of holding</wc-fetch>. A superstitious character of your choice might consider this scene evidence of the Bagman (detailed in &ldquo;Horror Monsters&rdquo; in chapter 5).</p>

Inside the footlocker are suits custom-made for a very tall man, a pouch containing 13 sp, and an amulet bearing the symbol of a skull surrounded by a skeletal ouroborosâ€”the icon of the Priest of Osybus (see chapter 5).</p>

Any character who examines the painting and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices a hinge that allows the frame to swing open. Doing so reveals a hidden shelf with a lockbox inside. The key from area 18 opens the lockbox. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick the lock, which requires 1 minute and a successful DC 14 Dexterity check.

The spirit isn&rsquo;t one of the Halvhrests, despite its claims. The Halvhrests' painted bodies perpetually melt and recongeal as the spirit speaks through each of them. It demands to know who the characters are, why they&rsquo;re in its house, and how they&rsquo;ll make amends for their trespasses. Whether the spirit can be placated and how is up to youâ€”encourage the players to suggest ways to satisfy it. If the spirit grows displeased, the Halvhrest images push through the painting, toppling out one per round until four Ghoul emerge. Each oil-paint-smeared ghoul attacks as soon as it appears from the painting.</p>
<p>The portrait has AC 12, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It can also be exorcised as a haunted trap with a +2 Haunt Bonus. If destroyed or exorcised, the painting returns to normal, the spirit no longer speaks through it, and no further ghouls emerge.</p>

A tenth piece is an amulet bearing the Mark of the Raven, a symbol used by the Keepers of the Feather (see chapter 3). The Mark of the Raven is not magical, but some fell forces recoil from the righteous powers it suggests (as in area 31). The amulet is worth 25 gp.</p>

The first time a creature touches the door, an incomplete symbol of the god Ezra appears amid the woodwork for an instant, then vanishes. This shield symbol doesn&rsquo;t bear the belladonna sprig that traditionally crosses it. If a character presents a belladonna sprig, such as from the plant in area 7, the <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> is suppressed for 10 minutes.</p>

Children&rsquo;s Bedroom</h3><blockquote>
<p>The room smells fresh, as if it&rsquo;s been recently cleaned and aired. Not a spot of dust sullies the pair of child-sized beds and other furnishings. A skeleton wearing a lady&rsquo;s dress with a veiled hat stares at you from where it sways in a wooden rocking chair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The skeleton is all that remains of Theodora Halvhrest. It is not undead, but a blessing laid upon this room causes the chair to sway. If the skeleton or the chair is touched, the chair stops rocking.</p>
<p>After the characters first enter the room (whether the house is dormant or awakened) and react to the skeleton, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boy&rsquo;s voice issues from a stuffed purple dragon on one of the beds. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not like the others. Should we hide from them too, Regan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter now, donkey!&rdquo; a girl&rsquo;s voice replies from a figure of a tin knight on the other bed. &ldquo;They got in, so maybe they&rsquo;re not hungry things yet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two spirits are Regan and Vastion Halvhrest. Their mother&rsquo;s occult knowledge and prayers to Ezra protected this room, but also trapped Regan&rsquo;s and Vastion&rsquo;s spirits here. The ghosts don&rsquo;t visually manifest, but they speak through their favorite toys. They eagerly converse with characters and fall silent if threatened. The spirits know the following information and share it with friendly characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The skeleton is their mother, Theodora. She prayed to Ezra to protect the room and keep out the &ldquo;hungry things.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The hungry things are bad spirits that took over. They &ldquo;stole&rdquo; the children&rsquo;s parents. The children don&rsquo;t know any named spirits.</li>
<li>They would like to leave but don&rsquo;t know how.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cavern&rsquo;s walls are contorted in the shapes of the hundreds of souls trapped within the house. This is the heart of the House of Lament, a tortured space formed around the amber monolith that contains the Entity.</p>
<p>A 30-foot-diameter depression surrounds the amber monolith. The sloped sides and the 2-foot-deep, polluted water at the bottom make the entirety of the crater difficult terrain. The water isn&rsquo;t harmful, but it is bitter, viscous, and stains like ink.</p>

These limbs use the statistics for five Shadow and don&rsquo;t leave area 31. Destroying the monolith causes the limbs and the vestige within to vanish without a trace. Whether the vestige is destroyed or released is for you to decide.</p>

If a character uses an action to present the Mark of the Raven, Mara does not attack on the next turn, the light from the amber monolith dwindles, and the shadowy limbs have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. A character can use the amulet multiple times, but doing so causes the shadowy limbs to focus their attacks on its bearer.</p>

Any character who uses an action to sift through the water and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check finds one of the following six treasures: one of four <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Healing</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type=item>deck of illusions</wc-fetch> in a watertight lacquered box, or Mara&rsquo;s crimson sword, Oathmakerâ€”a <wc-fetch type=item>sword of vengeance</wc-fetch> haunted by Mara Silvra (these magic items are detailed in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). All of these treasures become obvious if the liquid is drained, as do 220 sp, 30 gp, and twelve amulets bearing the Mark of the Raven (each worth 5 gp).</p>

The house remains awakened, but the domain&rsquo;s borders open. Mara re-forms after one week, returning the house to its full power.</p>
<p>If the amber monolith is destroyed, the house responds as described above and the inky water drains away, revealing the treasure within. Mara&rsquo;s spirit fades, whispering, &ldquo;Your slights are forgiven. Leave and never return to my home.&rdquo; Despite the monolith&rsquo;s destruction, the house regains its power after a week.</p>

Once characters leave the house, a new specter emerges from the house every other round on the specters' initiative count. The spirits shriek things like &ldquo;part of the house&rdquo; and &ldquo;feed us forever&rdquo; as the characters try to escape. If the characters reach the Mists, the spirit of Theodora Halvhrest parts the fog, allowing them to leave the domain.</p>

If the party doesn&rsquo;t release him, he breaks free himself after an hour. Dranzorg torments the party and rampages through the house, calling for Mara to face him.

Whether characters use the spirit board or another method to contact Mara, her furious spirit appears and demands the characters aid her in destroying Dranzorg. If they do, she&rsquo;ll let them leave the house. Mara demands the characters retrieve her armor from the tower chamber (area 26).
