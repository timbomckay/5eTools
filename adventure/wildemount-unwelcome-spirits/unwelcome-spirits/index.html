<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>An elder warlock from the goblinoid swamp village of Urzin has been kidnapped by soldiers of the Dwendalian Empire. Now the machinations of an evil imperial inquisitor might unleash an evil that could threaten the garrison at Fort Venture and the goblinoids of Urzin alike. &ldquo;Unwelcome Spirits&rdquo; is a Wildemount adventure that takes characters from 1st to 3rd level, and which introduces them to Wildemount&rsquo;s desolate and foreboding Eastern Wynandir region.</p>
<p>If your players are using the heroic chronicle to create their characters (see chapter 4), you can talk with them about creating characters with ties to Urzin or nearby Xhorhasian settlements. Alternatively, characters from elsewhere might be traveling to Urzin, whether individually or as a group. Since this adventure ties directly to the Kryn Dynasty&rsquo;s conflict with the Dwendalian Empire, you can also ask each player to consider their character&rsquo;s stance on the war and how the war might tie into their background.</p>

The village&rsquo;s elder seer, the goblin warlock Bol&rsquo;bara, has gone missing. Three nights ago, while foraging by night for rare alchemical ingredients, Bol&rsquo;bara was beset by a cadre of Dwendalian Empire soldiers near the foothills of Brokenveil Bluffs. On the orders of an imperial inquisitor named Parson Pellinost, the goblin warlock was forcefully escorted to the local garrison for questioningâ€”and for magical experimentation.</p>
<p>What neither the imperial forces nor the goblinoids of Urzin know is that Bol&rsquo;bara was performing a series of rare communal rites near a site of major arcane significance. With those rites interrupted, she is now in the throes of possession by her patron, a shadow demon known as Trush. If its dark power is set free, Trush could wreak havoc across the wastes of Xhorhas, using Bol&rsquo;bara as its worldly vessel.</p>

Buhfal seeks to resolve the plight of the missing warlock, Bol&rsquo;bara, which he worries will threaten the frail alliances among the village&rsquo;s restless goblinoids. He and his advisors suspect the nearby imperial outpost at Fort Venture has something to do with Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s fate. However, Buhfal knows that goblinoids advancing on Fort Venture will draw reprisals against Urzin, so he seeks an outside group who might more easily seek the warlock there and bring her back to help safeguard the settlement.</p>
<p>At Buhfal&rsquo;s behest, the characters must chart a course to the Brokenveil Bluffs with the help of a hobgoblin guide, locate Fort Venture, and extract Bol&rsquo;bara. Unfortunately, the reckless aims of the imperial inquisitor Parson Pellinost and his lackeys work to undermine their efforts. Without a timely interruption, the torturous interrogation of Bol&rsquo;bara will lead to her possession by Trush, her shadow demon patronâ€”and to a series of calamitous arcane events. Trush&rsquo;s demonic rampage will start at Fort Venture before wending its way back to Urzinâ€”and it&rsquo;s up to the adventurers to do something about it.</p>

Details regarding this unique settlement and its politics can be found in chapter 3. The Horizonback Tortoise that give the village its mobility are detailed in chapter 7. Goblinoid or orc characters might be residents of Urzin, but characters of other races are probably visitors to this remote settlementâ€”and are probably feeling very much out of their element.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to figure out if the characters already know each other or if this adventure is the first time they&rsquo;ve met. If none of the characters are goblinoids, they most likely already make up an adventuring party and have traveled to Urzin together.</p>

The characters might have made it known that they are mercenary adventurers seeking work, or they might simply look the part. Alternatively, if they are all strangers to the village, Lord Buhfal might approach them simply because he wants there to be no connection between the characters and the village if their intended mission goes bad.</p>
<p>The tone of the adventure and the read-aloud text assumes that the characters find Urzin a strange and exotic location. If the party consists of some or all goblinoids or other natives of Urzin, adjust the flavor and the read-aloud text accordingly.</p>
<p>Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rank odors of the Brokenveil Marsh mingle with the musty aroma of a fleet of gargantuan reptiles as you traverse the rickety rope bridges above Urzin. This strange goblinoid village moves slowly and endlessly through the swampy Xhorhasian wastes, its structures set atop the massive shells of horizonback tortoises. Urzin&rsquo;s monstrous residents pay you little heed until you approach the large, ramshackle hall of Ogre Lord Buhfal IIâ€”a towering structure of haphazard timber and scrap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters enter the hall of Ogre Lord Buhfal II, add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The din of the swamp and the hushed chatter of Urzin&rsquo;s residents is muted as you step through the folds of a heavy leather curtain into the chamber beyond. There, the reek of the marsh is quickly replaced by the favorable scent of roasted meats and spiced wine. Orc attendants gesture you toward a litter of dingy furs before the seat of Buhfal II, who allows you to settle in before his baritone voice issues a welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat. Drink. But be wary, for the empire has come to Xhorhas, bringing damnation with it!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ogre Lord Buhfal IIâ€”a lawful evil, male ogre with an Intelligence score of 10â€”explains the current situation to the characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since his father was slain forty years earlier by the Kryn paragon Sunbreaker Olomon, Buhfal II has seen a slow swell of discontent among Urzin&rsquo;s goblinoid population, who labor tirelessly to execute the Kryn Dynasty&rsquo;s clandestine agendas. An increasing number of Urzin&rsquo;s residents look to Buhfal and his advisors for leadership, despite the dynasty&rsquo;s overt hold on the area.</li>
<li>Three nights ago, Buhfal&rsquo;s most trusted counselor, the goblin witch Bol&rsquo;bara, journeyed to the foothills of the Brokenveil Bluffs to the west, where she regularly forages for ritual components. She never returned.</li>
<li>Buhfal doesn&rsquo;t know what happened to her, but he knows that Dwendalian Empire patrols had been spotted in the area in previous weeks. The patrols strike out from an outpost known as Fort Venture, which watches over the Brokenveil Bluffs.</li>
<li>An elder villager who remembers the reign of the first Buhfal, Bol&rsquo;bara is Urzin&rsquo;s chief loremaster and a pivotal ally in both the ongoing battle against the empire and the enduring struggle against the cruel environs of the Xhorhasian swamps. Little is known of Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s otherworldly patron, but her warlock powers are respected by all.</li>
<li>Without Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s arcane protections and political guile, Buhfal fears his people will grow submissive to the Kryn Dynasty&rsquo;s whims, making Urzin a more notable target for imperial reprisals.</li>
</ul>

For rescuing Bol&rsquo;bara from her kidnappers, the ogre lord agrees to pay 200 gp and to provide the characters with &ldquo;premium weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buhfal suggests that the characters begin by reconnoitering the imperial garrison at Fort Venture to the west, under the keen supervision of a hobgoblin scout named Morgid.</p>

Each character receives their choice of any simple melee weapon from weapons of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook, but these are crude weapons of goblinoid design. With resources scarce in Urzin, goblinoid-made weapons are often hastily crafted and cheap.</p>
<p>Characters looking for better gear can equip themselves (at normal prices) for the journey through Brokenveil Marsh by visiting one of Urzin&rsquo;s merchants. Popular stops in the village include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graaf the blacksmith (a lawful neutral, male orc) for weapons and armor</li>
<li>Quartermaster Krekk (a lawful evil, male goblin) for tools and adventuring gear</li>
<li>Vreya Trestilya (a chaotic good, agender drow) for bows, crossbows, arrows and bolts, as well as simple hunters' traps</li>
</ul>

Unless otherwise noted, all areas of the marsh are difficult terrain. The bog water in the marsh averages from 1 to 5 feet deep, but is too shallow and weed-bound for boats or rafts. Tiny creatures must have a swimming speed or be carried to traverse this watery terrain.</p>
<p>Any character not used to this environment who takes a short or long rest within the swamp without being on raised dry ground must make a DC 11 Constitution check. On a failure, the character contracts sewer plague (see &ldquo;Diseases&rdquo; in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide).</p>
<p>Key areas of Brokenveil Marsh are noted on map 5.11. Each hex on the map measures 1 mile across. Characters moving at a normal pace can travel 10 hexes per day on foot through the swampy terrain.</p>
<h3 id=navigation>
<a href=#navigation class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Navigation</h3><p>Have the players designate one party member as the navigator. The navigator might be an NPC, such as Morgid the hobgoblin or some other guide, and the party can switch its navigator day to day.</p>
<p>At the start of each new travel day, the DM makes a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check on behalf of the navigator. This check determines whether or not the party becomes lost over the course of the day. Apply a +5 bonus to the check if the group sets a slow pace for the day, or a âˆ’5 penalty if the group is moving at a fast pace. It&rsquo;s possible to get lost on a river by following a tributary instead of the main branch.</p>
<p>If the check succeeds, the navigator knows exactly where the party is on the players' map of Brokenveil Marsh throughout the day.</p>
<p>If the check fails, the party becomes lost. Each hex on the map is surrounded by six other hexes; whenever a lost party moves 1 hex, roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll> to randomly determine which neighboring hex the party enters, and don&rsquo;t divulge the party&rsquo;s location to the players. While the party is lost, players can&rsquo;t pinpoint the group&rsquo;s location on their map of Brokenveil Marsh. The next time a navigator succeeds on a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check made to navigate, reveal the party&rsquo;s actual location to the players.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boggy wetlands covered with waist-high water spread as far as the eye can see as you venture deeper into the mist-laden expanses of the Brokenveil Marsh. Morgid, your hobgoblin guide, knows the route you must follow, but that path leads through a hazardous morass and the territory of unknown monsters.</p>
<p>While you take a brief rest on a patch of relatively dry land, Morgid produces a scrap of bleached leather from his beltâ€”a map of the marsh. His eyes narrow as if trying to pierce the fog ahead as he glances from the marsh to the map and back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marsh loves outlanders like you,&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;Loves to gobble &lsquo;em up, bones and all. But worry you not, my friends. Morgid will lead the way. Maybe three days of swamp to sift through till we reach Fort Venture. And then it&rsquo;s your time to shine.&rdquo; The wild-eyed hobgoblin stuffs the map back into his belt and briskly wades into the bog once more, motioning for you to follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Morgid (a neutral, male hobgoblin) is an able scout, but his allegiance is tenuous. He gladly shares his map with the party and is keen to join in on the investigation of any landmarks or other points of interest, even as he warns of the importance of not dallying in the marsh. However, if the hobgoblin loses half or more of his hit points during a single combat encounter, he abandons the party unless one of the characters succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check to convince him otherwise.</p>

Sunken Boneyard</h3><p>A boggy field littered with the bones of massive beasts has become home to a raiding party of cannibal lizardfolk. Read the following when this site comes into view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fog parts ahead to reveal the skulls and bones of giant beasts rising from the marsh like a collection of morbid monuments. As you draw nearer, you spy three horizonback tortoise skulls beneath the shadow of a gargantuan rib cage at the center of this sullen boneyard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six bloodthirsty lizardfolk and a corrupted lizardfolk shaman named Skr&rsquo;a S&rsquo;orsk have taken up temporary residence in the shadows of this titanic heap of primordial skulls and bones. The lizardfolk regard this place as a holy site of profound religious significance. They attempt to ambush and attack any interlopers, but are particularly brutish against non-lizardfolk humanoids.</p>
<p>Skr&rsquo;a S&rsquo;orsk worships the demon lord Sess&rsquo;inek and has the following spells prepared:</p>
<p>Cantrips (at will): <wc-fetch type=spell>produce flame</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>resistance</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>thorn whip</wc-fetch></p>
<p>1st level (4 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>entangle</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>fog cloud</wc-fetch></p>

<p>3rd level (2 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>animate dead</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>conjure animals</wc-fetch> (reptiles only)</p>
<p>The boneyard provides ample humanoid bones for the corrupted shaman&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>animate dead</wc-fetch> spell, and the heavy clubs wielded by the lizardfolk are fashioned from massive femurs and the like. The lizardfolk are clad in a decorative assortment of bone jewelry, and bloody war paint. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check recognizes these affectations as tributes to the reptilian demon lord Sess&rsquo;inek. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check determines that the lizardfolk sect&rsquo;s proximity to the boneyard is fundamentally spiritual in nature.</p>

<p>The horizonback tortoise skulls used as dwellings by the lizardfolk are sparsely decorated with stone bedding and humanoid skull trophies.

<blockquote>
<p>As you near the end of the wetter portion of your journey, the mist-veiled western marshland slowly gives way to the rocky foothills of the Brokenveil Bluffs. Sharp crags and steep foothills are visible ahead, as are the openings to what must be hundreds of natural caves.</p>

Six Harpy lurk among this particular section of the foothills. These bluff harpies attempt to beguile interlopers with their Luring Song before attacking with claws and clubs.</p>

The Mossback Steward</h3><p>A massive hill appears to rise out of a lonely section of the Brokenveil Marsh. The hill is actually an aging horizonback tortoise nicknamed the Mossback Steward, who has presided over this area for time immemorial.</p>
<p>This encounter might occur if the characters approach Fort Venture from the swamp, or if becoming lost drives them south from a course to the Brokenveil Bluffs. Alternatively, you can have the Mossback Steward move from its marked location on the map, with its wandering course bringing it into the characters' path.</p>
<p>When the characters encounter the Mossback Steward, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you forge onward through the marsh, the mist clears to reveal a lone hillock crowned with a thicket of low-hanging mangrove trees. This bramble-covered knoll looks to be a perfect site to take respite from the murky waters of the swamp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>) check or a DC 18 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check realizes that the hill is, in fact, the partially submerged moss-covered shell of a horizonback tortoise. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check guesses that this must be the Mossback Steward, a creature of local mystery and renown.</p>

This unique creature is a horizonback tortoise (see chapter 7 for its stat block) with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mossback Steward has an Intelligence of 12 (+1) and a Wisdom of 17 (+3). It has the following skills: <wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> +5, <wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch> +7, <wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch> +5, <wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch> +7, <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch> +5.</li>
<li>It understands Common and Primordial, and has telepathy out to a range of 120 feet.</li>
<li>As an action, it can cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>friends</wc-fetch> cantrip, the <wc-fetch type=spell>suggestion</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 15), or the <wc-fetch type=spell>divination</wc-fetch> spell. After casting <wc-fetch type=spell>suggestion</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=spell>divination</wc-fetch>, it can&rsquo;t cast that spell again until it finishes a short or long rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mossback Steward is aware of the situation involving Bol&rsquo;bara and the Dwendalian garrison at Fort Venture. While the great tortoise has a keen understanding of Bol&rsquo;bara and her relationship with the people and tortoises of Urzin, the true intentions of the Dwendalian Empire&rsquo;s outpost and its leaders remain a mystery.</p>
<p>One thing is clear, though. Since the garrison at Fort Venture was established, the primordial harmony of the swamp has been disrupted. The Mossback Steward is more than willing to use its powers of divination to assist characters who display an honest interest in forcing the Dwendalian military out of Brokenveil Marsh.</p>

Fort Venture</h3><p>As the characters draw close to the fort, flashes of lightning and the sound of thunder should grow more prevalent.</p>
<p>The Dwendalian stronghold known as Fort Venture sits along a dismal stretch of marsh among the craggy foothills of the Brokenveil Bluffs. A timber palisade surrounds the fort&rsquo;s squat stone keep and muddy grounds, where rows of tents are set up alongside a central training field. The green timber of its battlements hint at the recent construction of this remote military outpost, while the bright colors of its quarried stonework and foreign banners readily betray its distinctly non-Xhorhasian heritage.</p>
<p>Read the following when the characters first catch sight of the fort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The swamp gives way to a grassy shoreline beneath a low promontory, on which sits a modest stone keep surrounded by a tall wooden palisade. Weather-worn Dwendalian flags hang forlornly above the massive front gate and from decorative pikes rising from the keep. Several rows of spiked barricades surround the palisade as a defense against the predators of Brokenveil Marsh.</p>
<p>A jagged bolt of lightning suddenly cuts through the misty air above the keep, striking the edifice as a mighty crack of thunder rumbles off to the horizon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fort Venture is detailed on map 5.12. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>) check or a DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check recognizes that the thunderstorm above Fort Venture is fixed around the outpost and the nearby promontory, while the rest of the marsh remains relatively unaffected by the strange weather.</p>
<p>Once the characters reach Fort Venture, the hobgoblin guide Morgid offers to run reconnaissance and to distract incoming Dwendalian patrols as the party infiltrates the fort. The precise condition of Fort Venture and its inhabitants is dependent on how long it took the characters to arrive, and how much of Parson Pellinost ill-fated exorcism of Bol&rsquo;bara has transpired. See &ldquo;Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s Exorcism&rdquo; later in this chapter for more information.</p>

Despite the outpost&rsquo;s modest appearance, its freshly laid stonework and newly erected battlements offer solid protection against the harsh environs and deadly creatures of the Brokenveil Marsh.</p>
<p>Commander Struther Felmont and the Dwendalian soldiers at the fort have grown callous and cruel under the leadership of Imperial Inquisitor Parson Pellinost, who conducts deranged experiments on the humanoids of the marsh with an unsavory and sadistic application of divine magic. The guards of Fort Venture engage in defense, training, and patrol work in eight-hour shifts. Few of those guards respect Pellinost, but all obey him for fear of strict retribution.</p>

After three days of torture and experimentation, Parson Pellinost triggers Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s full demonic possessionâ€”making her powerful enough to kill the inquisitor and escape captivity.</p>
<p>If the characters spend the minimum three days traversing the marsh and enter Fort Venture at once, they can either prevent the second phase of Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s possession or become witness to it. With or without the party&rsquo;s intervention, once Bol&rsquo;bara enters the second phase of her possession, she plots a return to Urzin and attempts to destroy anyone and anything in her way.</p>

Bol&rsquo;bara is of particular interest to the inquisitor, who has been torturing her to death, then bringing her back again using divine healing magic. Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s full demonic possession is triggered at the end of the third day after the characters set out from Urzin, when Pellinost utilizes the <wc-fetch type=spell>revivify</wc-fetch> spell a third time to bring Bol&rsquo;bara back to life.</p>

Most areas of Fort Venture will be affected by her escape, as indicated by additional descriptive text in the &ldquo;Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s Possession&rdquo; section in each area of the fort.

Give the players any chance of success that seems appropriate to their efforts, but remember that the shadow demon behind Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s transformation is a creature of chaos. It savors the taste of discord, and convincing Trush to relinquish its hold over the witch won&rsquo;t be easy.</p>

Palisade</h3><p>The palisade wall around the fort is easily scouted and assessed from a distance, but more difficult to get past. When the characters draw close to the fort, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wooden palisade that encloses Fort Venture stands over ten feet high and is topped by huge spikes. A gate in the middle of the east wall is flanked by two watchtowers and appears to be the only way in or out of the complex. The parapet of the fort&rsquo;s stone keep can be seen rising up from the center of the grounds. Tall grass and knotted brambles partially obscure a well-trodden path that winds up to the gate from the marsh. Rows of spiked barricades encircle the palisade, completing the appearance of a well-fortified military outpost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At any given time, each watchtower (including the two towers bordering the gate) is occupied by a Dwendalian guard equipped with a crossbow and a torch. The guards work in eight-hour shifts, with two guards present at each watchtower during shift changes. Characters who attempt to sneak into Fort Venture must find a way to avoid being spotted by the watchtower guards, whose position gives them advantage on all Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks to notice activity on the grounds around or inside the palisade.</p>
<p>Strangers approaching the fort are hailed by the watchtower guards and ordered to identify themselves. At the first sign of trouble (and the guards are inclined to view anything out of the ordinary as â€˜trouble'), a guard sounds an alarm on a horn whose call can be heard across the fortress.</p>

A character with a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 12 or higher is able to spot the traps and avoid them. Characters who don&rsquo;t spot the traps have a 50 percent chance of stepping on a bear trap and triggering it whenever they move through the area.</p>
<p>A bear trap&rsquo;s attack is +8 to hit and deals 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) piercing damage on a hit. This attack can&rsquo;t be made with advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap also has its speed reduced to 0 and can&rsquo;t move until it breaks free of the trap. Breaking free requires a successful DC 15 Strength check by the trapped creature or another creature within 5 feet of the trap. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables a bear trap.</p>

Any area containing a spiked barricade is difficult terrain. Any Large or bigger creature that moves through an area of spiked barricades must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (<wc-roll>1d6 + 2</wc-roll>) piercing damage.</p>

A character must succeed on a DC 12 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check to climb up the wall, followed by the same check to descend the other side unless a rope is lowered down. At the top of the wall, a character must make a DC 12 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check to safely slip up and over the palisade spikes. On a failed check, the character takes 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) piercing damage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The south side of the Fort Venture grounds is lined with three rows of canvas tents, presumably the garrison&rsquo;s barracks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When not on duty or training, the guards of Fort Venture spend most of their time in this tent yard, where they drink, gamble, or attempt to sleep despite the maddening howls of Pellinost&rsquo;s furious prisoners in the chapel (area V6). Each tent features a floor covered with straw, a cotton bedroll, a down pillow, and a small wooden footlocker.</p>
<p>Eight Guard are off duty when the characters arrive in this area, sleeping (an 80 percent chance) or resting but awake in their tents. Sleeping guards use their passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) scores to detect intruders or to hear the alarm being raised.</p>

Commander&rsquo;s Quarters</h3><p>This huge canvas tent is completely sealed except for a 5-foot-wide entrance flap on its eastern wall. When the characters can see into the tent, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the dim confines of this huge canvas tent, a tall human clad in splint mail stands before a small, lantern-lit table surrounded by three chairs. He takes a sip of wine from a copper goblet as he studies a large map on the tabletop. A crooked scar dances across the left side of his face, and his expression shows a hint of regret as he drinks again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The map shows the area of Brokenveil Marsh. On the west side of the tent, a wooden bed frame topped with a dusty mattress is flanked by a bedside table. A locked wooden chest lies at the foot of the bed, while a wooden weapon rack and armor stand on the north wall.</p>
<p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check can identify the Dwendalian insignias and medal of rank adorning the armor of Commander Struther Felmont (a lawful neutral, male human veteran). Felmont prefers the isolation of his command tent to the grim scene inside Pellinost&rsquo;s chapel, and retreats here whenever the priest conducts his strange exorcisms. He carries a key to the main hall (area V5).</p>
<p>At the first sight of intruders, Felmont reaches for a horn at his side and sounds the alarm, alerting the guards outside. The commander is fearful but stubborn, and parleys with the characters only if his support troops have been routed and he is obviously outnumbered or outclassed. If Felmont sounds the horn, six Dwendalian Guard arrive from the training yard within 2 rounds to fight at his side. If combat persists, all the remaining guards at Fort Venture eventually join the battle.</p>

Main Hall</h3><p>This small stone-walled keep serves as the main gathering hall for the soldiers of Fort Venture. Built on the foundations of a pre-Calamity ruin, the main hall is the strongest point in the fortress, and guards know to muster here for protection against the elements and interlopers.</p>
<p>As the characters approach this area, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The freshly quarried rocks of this squat stone keep lack the Brokenveil Bluffs' distinct mossy charm, and the structure&rsquo;s utilitarian style makes it even more foreboding. No windows are set into the stone walls, and a wide, iron-banded double door is the keep&rsquo;s only entrance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The front door can be locked and bolted from inside (see below) but is usually unlocked. When the characters can see inside the main hall, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three long tables decorate this sparse room, their oiled surfaces spotlessly clean. A closed wooden door is set into the far wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main hall is a place for the guards of Fort Venture to join together for meals, revelry, and prayer. However, most of the guards prefer to spend their time in the open spaces of the training yard or in their own tents because of the unsavory sounds that issue forth from Parson Pellinost&rsquo;s chapel (area V6).</p>

Any character with a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 12 or higher notes the looks of discomfort and unease both wear.

Chapel</h3><p>Since Parson Pellinost&rsquo;s arrival, the chapel built for the use of Fort Venture&rsquo;s soldiers has facilitated his fetish for torture and now houses a secret altar to the god of blood, death, and life: Vesh, the Bloody Siren (described in chapter 1).</p>
<p>When the characters can see into this area, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cramped room is lit by the flickering flames of two small braziers suspended from the ceiling. In the center of the room, a Dwendalian inquisitor stands above a bloody stone altar, clutching a crimson-stained mace in his prosthetic right hand. On the altar, a goblin struggles furiously against the chains that bind her. A Dwendalian guard looks on with glee and disgust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters arrive, Parson Pellinost and an imperial guard are in the process of torturing the demon-possessed Bol&rsquo;bara to the point of deathâ€”with the sadistic intention of reviving her to repeat the process. Bol&rsquo;bara has been suffering this horrific treatment for days, and the rage in her eyes suggests that she would do equally horrific things in return if released from this torturous captivity.</p>
<p>What Pellinost doesn&rsquo;t know is that the third time he attempts to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>revivify</wc-fetch> on the possessed warlock, her tortured mind will break, allowing her to be possessed by her shadow demon patronâ€”a fiend known as Trush.</p>
<p>Bol&rsquo;bara is a chaotic good (for now at least), female goblin (see the accompanying stat block), but she doesn&rsquo;t have legendary actions until she is fully possessed.</p>
<p>Parson Pellinost uses the priest stat block but has the following cleric spells prepared:</p>
<p>Cantrips (at will): <wc-fetch type=spell>light</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>sacred flame</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>spare the dying</wc-fetch></p>
<p>1st level (4 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>command</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>cure wounds</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>guiding bolt</wc-fetch></p>

<p>3rd level (2 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>revivify</wc-fetch></p>
<p>Pellinost has a <wc-fetch type=item>prosthetic limb</wc-fetch> (right hand), as described in chapter 6, as well as keys to the main hall, the chapel door, and the altar manacles.</p>

Her alignment becomes chaotic evil, and she gains the legendary actions noted in her stat block. After destroying Pellinost and the garrison of Fort Venture, Bol&rsquo;bara heads into the Brokenveil Marsh, slaying every creature she meets on her way back to destroy the village of Urzin.</p>
<p>To prevent the people of Urzin from suffering a terrible fate, the characters must track Bol&rsquo;bara across the swamp and intercept her for a final confrontation. You can use a location the characters didn&rsquo;t visit on their journey to the fort as the site of a climactic battle, or reuse an already-visited site as a location for a deadly ambush. Alternatively, you could have the characters catch the warlock as she reaches Urzin, turning the unique village into the site of a deadly battle.</p>
<p>Ending Bol&rsquo;bara&rsquo;s possession while she is alive is beyond the characters' abilities. However, if the warlock is reduced to 0 hit points during the party&rsquo;s confrontation with her, she falls <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> rather than dying outright. If she is brought back to 1 hit point within 3 rounds, she is restored to her normal self. This reverts her alignment to chaotic good and causes her to lose her legendary actions. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check when the warlock falls can deduce this fact from observing how the unnatural magic infusing her dissipates, or the characters might receive this information as a prophetic insight from the Mossback Steward (area B8).</p>

If the characters fail, Bol&rsquo;bara attacks Urzin and becomes an ongoing threat in Brokenveil Marshâ€”a threat for which the characters are almost certain to be blamed, by any surviving goblinoids and the Dwendalian Empire alike.</p>

Further opportunities for adventure might be found in Eastern Wynandir, perhaps involving the goblinoids of Urzin or the soldiers of Fort Venture. Or the characters might use the success of this adventureâ€”or their unwelcome notoriety if the mission failedâ€”as an excuse to seek out new opportunities elsewhere in Wildemount.</p>
