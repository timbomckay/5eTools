<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>&ldquo;Forgotten Relics&rdquo; is a short adventure for a party of four to six 1st-level characters, who advance to 2nd level by the adventure&rsquo;s conclusion. It is set in Sharn and serves as an introduction to the city. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges.</p>

With a lot of ground to cover beneath the City of Towers, Garra kidnapped Caden d&rsquo;Orien, the only son of Alden d&rsquo;Orien, forcing Alden to use his position in his dragonmarked house to recruit out-of-work warforgedâ€”people no one would missâ€”to scour Old Sharn&rsquo;s ruins. Alden branded the work as a &ldquo;secret research-gathering mission&rdquo; for his house, paid the warforged workers for their silence, and signed them to binding contracts.</p>
<p>It took several weeks of dangerous exploring and a few deaths, but eventually the warforged workers found a library of arcane texts and schemas buried in the ruins. These items were moved to a Daask safe house in Tavick&rsquo;s Landing near the Terminus Lightning Rail station. The organization plans to smuggle the relics out Breland to Droaam with Alden&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>Coal, a destitute warforged hired by Alden, witnessed her good friend Razor die, executed in the ruins of Old Sharn as an example to the other workers. Coal made an appointment to talk to Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch, to report the shady operation, Razor&rsquo;s murder, and the kidnapping of the House Orien scion, Caden. Thanks to crooked members of the Sharn Watch in Daask&rsquo;s pocket, Garra found out about the appointment and dispatched killers to prevent Coal from ratting out the operation.</p>
<p>Germaine is also crooked, but she is on the payroll of the Boromar Clan crime syndicate, whose members are enemies of Daask. Not wanting to put the Sharn Watch or herself between two criminal organizations at war, Germaine called in a few old contacts to meet with Coal and find out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

You should read the entire adventure before attempting to run it. If you&rsquo;d prefer to play, you shouldn&rsquo;t read any farther.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Monster Manual contains statistics for many of the creatures found in this adventure. When a creature&rsquo;s name appears in <strong>bold</strong> type, that&rsquo;s a visual cue pointing you to the creature&rsquo;s stat block in the Monster Manual. If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure&rsquo;s text tells you so.</p>

Coal has already been told to wait for the characters at the Cog Carnival, a warforged bar in the High Walls district of Lower&rsquo;s Tavick&rsquo;s Landing.</p>
<p>After talking to Coal and learning her employer was Alden d&rsquo;Orien, the characters are confronted by Daask forces sent to kill Coal. If they survive the fight, the characters can meet with Alden in the Mithral Tower district Upper Central Plateau. The scion stays tight-lipped, but Vishtai, Alden&rsquo;s kalashtar bodyguard, telepathically gives the characters directions to the Old Sharn ruin where Caden d&rsquo;Orien is imprisoned.</p>
<p>If Caden is rescued and returned to his father, Alden shares what he knows of Daask&rsquo;s operation and tells the characters where to find Garra. The half-ogre knows the characters are coming for her. She tries to flee on a lightning rail while drawing them into a trap. If the characters chase down the half-ogre, she attempts to make a deal to keep her freedom, which they can either refuse or accept, setting the stage for further adventures.</p>

Ask each character to come up with a friendly connection to Germaine, or have them choose or roll on the Germaine Connections table.

<blockquote>
<p>An orange glow covers the top of Lyrandar Tower as the sun sinks in the sky. Above, the great airships of House Lyrandar float like leviathans surrounded by brilliant rings of elemental energy. Below, bridges crisscross at all levels of the city, connecting Sharn&rsquo;s great towers. The sounds of crying children, barking vendors, cursing skycoach drivers, and braying hippogriffs rise up to become a unique din that can only be heard in the City of Towers.</p>
<p>Each of you carries a letter from your acquaintance Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch that reads, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling on you for a job. I can&rsquo;t write the details, but it pays well and requires your skills. Meet me at the airship dock on top of Lyrandar Tower. Come armed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have the players introduce their characters to each other, if they aren&rsquo;t already acquainted. Ask characters who aren&rsquo;t from Sharn how they arrived, perhaps on an airship (likely paid for by Germaine whose Kundarak account is flush with Boromar gold) or a lightning rail. For characters who are Sharn natives, provide a brief description of various districts that fit the characters' backgrounds if needed using the information in chapter 3.</p>
<p>This is also a good time for characters to make personal connections that might link them, such as having the same birthplace, fighting for the same side in the Last War, or having common backgrounds or interests. Once the characters' relationships to one another have been established, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As darkness descends on the city, you see windows light up the towers around you from bottom to top. A cool wind whisks between you, drowning out the other noises of the city. A nearby lift rises, carrying a human in her mid-thirties with close cropped black hair and a glowing pipe in her mouth. Germaine gives a wry smile as she nods to you all, saying, &ldquo;Thanks for coming.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sergeant Germaine Vilroy (neutral female Brelish human veteran) greets the characters then gets down to business.</p>

While many of these second-rate thugs act like they have the absolute authority of the Sharn Watch, know your rights! These sellswords can get away with atrocities, including murder, but only if such crimes are committed in the pursuit of their contracts. Should one of these ruffians steal from or harm you or your loved ones for no reason other than their barbaric attitudes, report them to the Watch and this publication immediately. The Sharn Watch is bound by law to arrest these hooligans when they show their criminal natures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Germaine is gruff and doesn&rsquo;t like wasting time. She gives the characters the information she has and tries to send them on their way before they can ask questions about her involvement in the case. The sooner the characters solve her problem, the sooner she can get back to collecting extra money from the Boromar Clan for doing nothing other than ignoring their crimes.</p>
<p>Germaine gives the characters the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Germaine has an appointment to meet with a warforged named Coal, who claims to have knowledge of a crime being committed in Old Sharn. Germaine wants the party to meet with Coal first and see if what she says adds up. Germaine is worried that, with her status as a Watch sergeant, her presence will call undue attention and endanger Coal.</li>
<li>Germaine can give the characters 25 gp each now and another 50 gp each if they bring in Coal.</li>
<li>If the characters consent to meet with Coal, Germaine provides the location of the Cog Carnival, a bar in High Walls frequented by warforged, and the appointed meeting time.</li>
<li>Germaine also provides a Sharn Watch writ of enforcement. The writ authorizes the bearers to conduct official duties of the Watch under Sergeant Vilroy&rsquo;s authority. City workers and other members of the Watch respect the writ, sometimes grudgingly, as long as the characters don&rsquo;t engage in flagrantly illegal activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Germaine tries to play up her concern for Coal as her reason for hiring the characters, but a character who succeeds on a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check contested by the Germaine&rsquo;s Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check can sense that she&rsquo;s holding something back. A character who talks to Germaine privately and succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check gets her to reveal that she sometimes takes money from the Boromar Clan to look into crimes, and the family is interested in Coal&rsquo;s information (though Germaine also points out that the characters really are Coal&rsquo;s best shot at surviving this ordeal, what with Coal being caught between the two largest criminal syndicates in the city).</p>
<p>If the characters have no place to stay in Sharn, Germaine puts them up at Ghallanda Hall in Middle Dura for the duration of their investigation.</p>

All of the bridges from other districts to High Walls have massive, magically warded gates that can be sealed at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Each gate incorporates a fortified Sharn Watch station. The neighborhood is home to refugees of the Last War, mainly the displaced peoples of Cyre.</p>
<p>When the characters arrive in the district, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stench of body odor, garbage, and tobacco mix together in the streets. High walls cut this district&rsquo;s crumbling, vandalized buildings off from the rest of Sharn, though towers rise over the walls like imposing sentries. Many people stand idly on street corners, eying you suspiciously and keeping to themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a simple matter to find the Cog Carnival, and just about any resident can give directions. It&rsquo;s the only warforged bar in the neighborhood.</p>

The bar has a crumbling stone outside marred with graffiti that says things like, &ldquo;Forged Are Scrap!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Leave, Metalheads!&rdquo; Ingot, a neutral warforged soldier (see chapter 6) with a carved chunk of wood replacing a severed foot, collects a cover fee from creatures that enter the room. Warforged can enter the building for free, but other humanoids must pay 5 cp each.</p>
<p>When the characters enter the Cog Carnival, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smoky, low flames in a fireplace barely illuminate the cracked stone walls and filthy floor of this establishment. The single-room space is crowded with warforged with severed digits or limbs, scars, burns, and other wounds. Other warforged in the area are gathered around traditional dice, card, dart, and board games as well as carnival competitions such as throwing metal rings onto posts, tossing a ball at a tower of weighted iron cups hard enough to make them fall down, and striking a homemade machine hard enough with a hammer to make it ring a bell.</p>
<p>A small bar in the corner serves cheap ale. Behind this bar, a warforged bartender shouts jeers at patrons losing games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smelt, a lawful good warforged soldier (see chapter 6), is the owner of the Cog Carnival. She wanted to create a safe place where warforged could gather and socialize in this district. She can&rsquo;t afford the city&rsquo;s expensive gambling license, so she made the Cog Carnival a place where warforged can play games for free.</p>

If asked about Coal, most of them remain tight-lipped. A character who provides a bribe of 1 gp or succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check convinces one of the patrons to point out who Coal is: a black, one-armed metal warforged sitting alone near the bar.</p>
<p>Coal, a neutral good warforged soldier (see chapter 6), is missing her right arm. If the characters approach her without identifying that they work for Sergeant Vilroy, Coal immediately notifies the bartender, Smelt, that she&rsquo;s being bothered by the party.

Vilroy&rsquo;s explanation to the party about attracting attention soothes Coal, as does the party explaining they are Vilroy&rsquo;s trusted confidants.</p>
<p>Once Coal is calmed, she hurriedly explains the kidnapping of a child from House Orien, the murder of her friend Razor, and Daask&rsquo;s hunt for artifacts in Old Sharn. Just as Coal is finishing her exposition, a bolt of fire explodes inches from Coal&rsquo;s head, causing bedlam in the Cog Carnival. Coal runs for her life, shouting that the party set her up. The chase is on!</p>

The warforged has no particular destination in mind. She simply wants to get away from the characters, whom she believes set her up to be assassinated. This chase takes place in the &ldquo;theater of the mind,&rdquo; and there is no map for it.</p>
<p>If Coal runs away and the characters pursue her, use the chase rules and urban chase complications in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide to resolve the scene. The chase ends when the characters catch up to Coal or after three rounds, when a Daask hit squad intercepts Coal as she runs through an alley.</p>
<h4 id=daask-hit-squad>
<a href=#daask-hit-squad class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Daask Hit Squad</h4><p>If they fail to catch up to Coal before the Daask hit squad attacks, the characters hear the warforged scream for help in a nearby alley. If the characters rush to help her, they find the warforged <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> on the ground, but stable, surrounded by the Daask criminals. If the characters resolve the chase by catching up to Coal, the Daask criminals attack as soon as the chase ends, and the warforged aids the characters in battle.</p>
<p>The Daask force consists of Hound, a chaotic evil female shifter (see chapter 6), leading three cranky Kobold and one kobold acolyte. Each Daask criminal fights until reduced to half its hit points then flees. If the characters capture one of the criminals, a successful DC 13 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check compels the captive to reveal the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The group works for Daask, a criminal organization.</li>
<li>The criminals were told to kill Coal via a letter sent by a Daask lieutenant named Garra. The letter has since been destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The criminals have no other useful information to share with the characters. They don&rsquo;t know Garra is a half-ogre, and they don&rsquo;t know how to contact her. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check knows Daask&rsquo;s members are mostly immigrants from Droaam and some of the local population from the Cogs and lower wards of Sharn.</p>

The warforged is soft-spoken and mild-mannered. If the characters ask her about Razor, she gets sad and offers the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Razor served with Coal in the Cyran military during the Last War, during which Coal lost her right arm.</li>
<li>Razor and Coal had trouble finding work in Sharn, due to the fact that many businesses are reluctant to hire warforged foreigners. The pair became desperate for money.</li>
<li>A month ago, Razor told Coal she had a job working on a long-term secret mission for Alden d&rsquo;Orien, the scion of a dragonmarked house. Warforged from other parts of the city were also recruited to help in the task. The job required physical labor, so Coal&rsquo;s injury prevented her from being able to do the job. Razor planned to save money then buy Coal a new arm so she could work with her.</li>
<li>Razor would often come back from work sullen or wounded but never opened up about the job until shortly before she died. Razor confessed that the job was more dangerous than it seemed when she was recruited. Razor was planning to quit before she died.</li>
</ul>
<p>After providing the characters with this information, Coal encourages the characters to question Alden d&rsquo;Orien. The warforged then leaves Sharn, believing she is no longer safe in the city.</p>

If the characters ask around, they learn Alden d&rsquo;Orien has a residence called Unicorn Estate in the Mithral Tower district of Upper Central Plateau. If the characters consult with Sergeant Vilroy, she suggests that they confront Alden d&rsquo;Orien, but cautions them to be diplomatic.</p>

When the characters enter this district, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gates of Unicorn Estate are open, allowing the characters walk onto the property after first presenting themselves to the guards and stating their business.</p>
<p>Many of the grand homes in Mithral Tower are true to the district&rsquo;s name, boasting mithral filigree. The Sharn Watch seems to be everywhere in this neighborhood full of busy scions climbing into skycoaches, hosting opulent parties, and showing off their latest purchases at all hours of the day.</p>
<p>Unicorn Estate has a grand unicorn statue and unicorn-shaped topiaries adorning the yard beyond an open, wrought-iron gate. Flanking this gate are two guards in House Orien livery. Each wears a beautiful helm shaped like the head of a unicorn.</p>
<p>The magnificent marble home is clearly owned by one of the city&rsquo;s wealthiest dragonmarked families. Seated on a patio couch are two figures engaged in quiet conversation: a haggard man in his late thirties and an attentive kalashtar who holds a rose-colored crystal in his hands. Two more guards dressed like the ones at the gates stand nearby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that the grounds of the estate radiate auras of abjuration and illusion magic. Any humanoid that takes a long rest in the estate can attune to the property as if they were attuning to a magic item (see &ldquo;Attunement&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). A creature attuned to Unicorn Estate can&rsquo;t be affected by enchantment spells of 3rd level or lower while it is on the property unless it wishes to be. When a creature not attuned to the estate enters the property, the illusion of a unicorn appears wherever the creature is and brays loudly, announcing its presence. Four human Guard provide security at the estate, with two at the front gate and two following Alden.</p>
<p>Alden d&rsquo;Orien (neutral male Brelish human noble) and his assistant, Vishtai (chaotic good male kalashtar; see chapter 6), are talking about official house business. Vishtai records notes in a <wc-fetch type=item>spellshard</wc-fetch>. When the pair notices the characters, Alden calls them over and asks their business.</p>

He has not yet informed his wife, Iyana, that their son has been kidnapped. Alden and Iyana are separated, and Iyana lives in distant Fairhaven with her sister.</p>
<p>Alden is terse with the characters and wants them to leave him alone. The moment they bring up Daask, the Sharn Watch, or Coal, he becomes agitated, placing his hands over his face and emits a strangled scream. Use the following to guide the party&rsquo;s interaction with Alden:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alden badly wants to rescue his son but is terrified of taking action and seeing Caden harmed.</li>
<li>Caden was abducted almost a month ago. Alden tucked him in one night, he was gone the following morning with a message in his place.</li>
<li>A hulking half-ogre met with Alden in the following days, explaining she needed expendable labor and easy transit of said labor and goods. As long as he complied, Caden would be returned unharmed when her business was done.</li>
<li>If Alden backed out of the deal, the half-ogre said she would visit horrors on Caden that would make the Mockery sick.</li>
<li>Alden breaks down sobbing after relaying this information and staggers inside.</li>

He hates bullies and pushes for Alden to try to rescue his son rather than to keep giving in to Daask&rsquo;s demands. After the characters speak to Alden, Vishtai telepathically relays this message to them before hurrying to follow Alden inside:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt that Caden will die, regardless of Alden&rsquo;s actions. Please, save Caden and return him to his father. House Orien would owe you a great debt, and you see how broken the man is. There is an enclosed lift five buildings north of this estate. Look for the medusa inside. Make sure you&rsquo;re alone, as this lift will take you down to the dig site and, hopefully, Caden.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the party wishes to speak further, Vishtai will hurriedly offer the following bits of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The kidnapper asked for warforged laborers, preferably immigrants. These laborers are digging for something in a sparsely inhabited area of Old Sharn.</li>
<li>The lift the characters must use has been modified in some way to reach Old Sharn.</li>
<li>If the characters rescue Caden, Vishtai is certain that he and Alden can help them track down the kidnapper.</li>

Anyone wishing to use the lift must open a hidden panel and hot-wire it. An &ldquo;out of order&rdquo; sign hangs above a nearby button which opens the lift&rsquo;s doors. When the doors open, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The double doors on the enclosed lift car open to reveal the inside of a 15-foot cube made of stone with etchings of unicorn patterns covering its walls. A magic orb in the ceiling illuminates the lift. Two young adultsâ€”a shifter and a well-dressed humanâ€”talk nose to nose, cradling each other&rsquo;s faces in a corner of the elevator, absorbed fully in each other and taking no notice of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luna (chaotic neutral female shifter; see chapter 6) and Vonnie ir&rsquo;Cardwan (neutral female Brelish human noble) are having a secret date on the lift. This is where they first met, so it&rsquo;s a frequent rendezvous. They are bemused by the interruption and politely ask the party to leave, pointing out the lift is broken and growing more insistent and annoyed if the characters don&rsquo;t comply. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Diplomacy or <wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check convinces the couple to leave the lift. If a character fails the <wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch> check or removes the secret panel (see &ldquo;Medusa Panel&rdquo; below), Vonnie gets upset and plainly states she is summoning the Watch and stalks away with Luna. Two minutes later, Vonnie returns with three city Watch Guard and accuses them of harassing her, vandalizing the lift, or both. The guards arrest the party if the lift appears tampered with. Presenting Vilroy&rsquo;s writ and explaining the situation causes the guards to back off. Hostile action toward the young lovers or the guards results the guards attempting to subdue the party.</p>

A tool or weapon can be used to pry open the panel, behind which are several wires connecting the lift car to a small Eberron dragonshard. Each wire is connected to an individual pin-sized hole in the dragonshard. A character who is proficient in <wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> knows the dragonshard and wires control the movement of the lift. A character who makes a successful DC 13 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check finds a loose wire among those attached to the dragonshard and a hole in the dragonshard with no wire attached. A character who attaches the loose wire to the dragonshard causes the lift to descend into the ruins of Old Sharn. While that wire is attached to the crystal, the lift cannot be called anywhere else in the city.</p>

Orgon wants to go down to Old Sharn&rsquo;s ruins to help guard the relic excavation site. If Luna and Vonnie are on the lift when Orgon enters, they leave immediately.</p>
<p>When Orgon enters the lift, he demands the characters get out of the car. If the characters don&rsquo;t leave, Orgon attacks them. Orgon fights until reduced to 10 hit points then surrenders. A successful DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check gets Orgon to admit to being a member of Daask and gets him to show the characters how to bring the lift down to the ruins of Old Sharn.</p>

<p>The lift seems to descend forever into the belly of Sharn. Several minutes pass as and the lift rattles and shakes, as if passing into some place it was not meant to go. This rumbling builds to a violent peak then the lift stops, and its doors open.</p>
<p>By the lift&rsquo;s interior light, you can see into a vast, unlit cavern strewn with broken stonework from ancient buildings as far as you can see in every direction. The air is stale, and filled with dust and the scent of decay. These are the ruins of the cities atop which Sharn is built.</p>
<p>Ahead of you yawns a fifty-foot-diameter, ten-foot-deep pit that seems to have been intentionally dug. You hear the soft sobs of a young child coming from a wooden shed on the far side to the pit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cavern is irregular in shape and hundreds of feet in diameter. Its uneven ceiling ranges in height from 15 to 30 feet. Due to the rubble, the ground around the pit counts as difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Four Daask Goblin guard this area and rely on <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> to see. They hide in the pit when the characters arrive then leap out to attack. A successful Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check contested by the goblins' Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check notices the goblins. Otherwise the goblins surprise the characters. The goblins fight until one remains who flees into Old Sharn&rsquo;s ruins. If a goblin is captured, a successful DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check gets the goblin to reveal that it works for Daask and that it was told by a half-ogre named Garra to guard this area. The goblins don&rsquo;t know where Garra is.</p>

A warforged corpse lies at the bottom of the pit, its head struck from its shoulders. Eleven other warforged in various states of disrepair sit chained together on the pit floor. Climbing the walls of the pit doesn&rsquo;t require an ability check.</p>
<p>If the party does not intervene, the warforged laborers simply sit until release by Garra or another member of Daask. If the party frees them, the warforged scatter to other parts of the Cogs, grateful for the rescue. They might assist the party in a future adventure if you so choose.</p>

When the characters peer inside the shed, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wooden shed contains a small child covered in dust, wearing the once-fine, now-ruined livery of a House Orien. The boy sobs, shrunken into one corner, his face slack. Stale bread, smelly water, a pile of rags, and a chamber pot round out the accommodations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caden&rsquo;s manacles, originally designed to bind goblins, are sturdy but old. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check with <wc-fetch type=item>thieves' tools</wc-fetch> picks the manacles' lock, and a character who succeeds on a DC 17 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check breaks the manacles loose.</p>
<p>A character who succeeds on a DC 11 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check finds the manacles' lock is smeared with oil of taggit. Any character that attempts to pick the lock without gloves is exposed to the poison and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> for 24 hours. The <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> creature is <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>. It wakes up if it takes damage.</p>

If freed, the six-year-old simply sits and stares in to the middle distance. Any character trained in <wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch> knows that the boy needs proper food and water, rest, and his father. Using any sort of healing magic on the boy rouses him almost immediately. A successful DC 13 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check gets him to open up about his experience. A character who spends an hour consoling Caden and giving him something to eat and drink brings him around, no check required. If either of these methods succeed, Caden tells the characters he was kidnapped by a big, mean lady named Garra and imprisoned here by her goblin friends.</p>

The ghost of a gnome inquisitive who died when the old city collapsed during the War of the Mark rises from the rubble and looks quizzically at the party. This encounter is optional; its purpose is to provide a fun way to give some background on the city.</p>
<p>The ghost&rsquo;s name is Pfingston Nezzelech, and he&rsquo;s been dead for over 500 years. This encounter can take as long as you&rsquo;d like. Consider mentioning some of the different wards of the city you&rsquo;d like the party to know.</p>
<p>Pfingston&rsquo;s dress, mannerisms, and lack of contemporary knowledge mark him as belonging to a bygone era. He is cursed to walk this section of ruins, investigating a jewel heist that, by now, can&rsquo;t be solved. Pfingston is eager to question the party about their whereabouts on the night of the heist and if they have any leads. If one or more party members opts to spend an hour listening to Pfingston&rsquo;s theories and following him in his search of this ruined area, they witness Pfingston finding his skeleton tucked in a rubble-strewn corner. Upon finding his bones, Pfingston looks amazedly about at the party before fading away. Anyone who assisted him gains advantage on Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) or Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) skill checks for the next 24 hours.</p>

Still, he is saddened by the deaths of the warforged that he hired to work for Daask, but he doesn&rsquo;t regret the actions that kept his son alive.</p>
<p>Alden thanks the characters and tells them everything he knows, which is all the information contained in the first three paragraphs of the &ldquo;Story Overview&rdquo;. In addition, he gives the characters the address of a Terminus apartment in Lower Tavick&rsquo;s Landing that Garra uses as a safe house and a place to store the books and schemas found in Old Sharn&rsquo;s ruins.</p>
<p>When the characters have all the information they need from Alden to find Garra, the Orien heir offers them a sum of 50 gp to leave his name and House Orien out of their report to the Sharn Watch. Alden is deeply ashamed of being manipulated in this way and doesn&rsquo;t want to tarnish his reputation or his house. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check gets Alden to raise this amount to 100 gp. If the characters report Alden&rsquo;s actions to the Sharn Watch, he manages to bury the scandal on his own, and the characters become his enemies (see &ldquo;Conclusion&rdquo;). If the characters conclude their business with Alden on friendly terms, he offers his residence as a place where they can rest and grab a bite to eat before moving on.</p>

Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players when this occurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you cross a bridge that views the city from a dizzying height, you hear a familiar voice from above. &ldquo;Need a lift?&rdquo; asks Sergeant Vilroy as she descends toward you in a skycoach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Vilroy&rdquo; urges the characters to board the skycoach and share what they have learned thus far. If the characters mention Garra&rsquo;s safe house, the changeling tells them there&rsquo;s no time to waste and suggests the skycoach is the fastest means of getting there. If the characters ask the sergeant how she found them, the changeling replies, &ldquo;I work for the Sharn Watch. Knowing things is my job!&rdquo; If the characters accept the ride, the skycoach takes them to area T1 of Terminus. Unknown to Jas, Garra has also arranged for a Daask strike team to attack the skycoach en route.</p>
<p>Any character who suspects that &ldquo;Vilroy&rdquo; is hiding something can make a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check contested by the changeling&rsquo;s Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check. A character who wins the contest detects slight differences in the sergeant&rsquo;s facial expressions, suggesting that she&rsquo;s not the same person the party interacted with previously. Jas doesn&rsquo;t have details of any prior conversations the party had with the real Sergeant Vilroy and flubs any sustained questioning.</p>
<p>If the characters realize they&rsquo;re not dealing with the real Sergeant Vilroy and confront the changeling, Jas leaps out of the skycoach, uses a <wc-fetch type=item>feather token</wc-fetch> to land safely, and flees into the crowded city. Each character has one turn to act before the unpiloted skycoach crashes. A character proficient with air vehicles who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence check as an action gains control of the skycoach and stops it from falling. If the coach crashes, the characters are thrown from it as it hurdles down. Use the Falling in Sharn table in chapter 3 to determine what happens to characters who fall. The party has three rounds to catch Jas before the changeling adopts a new guise.</p>
<p>If the characters capture Jas, the changeling reveals that Garra is leaving Sharn on a lightning rail bound for Wroat. The changeling doesn&rsquo;t know about Garra&rsquo;s trap and simply has instructions to deliver the characters.</p>

Garra has sent the gnolls to kill the characters if possible, or at least soften them up before they arrive at her Terminus safe house. You can describe them to the players as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zipping between the towers of Sharn and converging on your location are five creatures riding disks of crackling green energy. Each creature is a lanky humanoid covered in fur, with the head of a hyena. They cackle maniacally, nock arrows, and take aim at you with their longbows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each gnoll rides a magical, 3-foot-diameter disk that can support up to 250 pounds. A creature on a disk can use its bonus action to move the disk up to 60 feet in any directionâ€”fast enough to keep pace with the skycoaches of Sharn. A disk otherwise hovers in place. These disks were created using a spell similar to <wc-fetch type=spell>Tenser&rsquo;s floating disk</wc-fetch> that was cast by a Daask wizard who does not appear in this adventure. The spell ends in 30 minutes, after which the disks disappear.</p>
<p>The gnolls initially keep their distance, peppering the characters with arrows. The gnolls become frustrated and close to melee range if the characters take advantage of cover and the gnolls' ranged attacks prove ineffective. Once three gnolls are disposed of, the remainder flee on their disks or on foot.</p>

Map 4.14 shows a cross-section and floor plan of the station. The Terminus district is right near Wroann&rsquo;s Gate, most travelers' entry point into Sharn. It bustles with crowds, pickpockets, con artists, and other criminals looking to take advantage of the city&rsquo;s visitors.</p>
<p>Garra has an apartment in Terminus where she left a trap for the characters. The half-ogre took the books and schemas recovered in Old Sharn&rsquo;s ruins and boarded a lightning rail bound for Wroat that&rsquo;s about to leave Terminus Station.</p>

Their walls require a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check to climb without equipment. The interior areas of buildings are built to accommodate creatures of various sizes and have 15-foot-high ceilings and doorways.</p>
<p>A building&rsquo;s doors are made of wood. Each door has AC 15, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If a door is locked, its lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check with <wc-fetch type=item>thieves' tools</wc-fetch>, and the door can be forced open with a successful DC 17 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p><wc-fetch type=item>Everbright lantern</wc-fetch> (see chapter 5) hanging from the ceilings and walls illuminate interior areas.</p>
<p>Buildings in Terminus have openable glass windows large enough that a Medium or smaller creature can fit through one without a problem, while a Large creature can squeeze through. These windows have AC 13, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The windows can be locked from the inside. A character that succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check with <wc-fetch type=item>thieves' tools</wc-fetch> unlocks a window from the outside.</p>
<p>If a creature makes a Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check to shove another creature against a window (see &ldquo;Shoving a Creature&rdquo; in chapter 9 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook) and succeeds on the check by 5 or more, the window&rsquo;s glass is destroyed and the shoved creature falls through the window&rsquo;s opening (see &ldquo;Falling&rdquo; below).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Nur, a Daask gnoll, is burning Garra&rsquo;s documents as ordered by the half-ogre. Of the documents that remain on the floor, two are of interest. One is a receipt for a lightning rail ticket, indicating the time, date, and journey of Garra&rsquo;s lightning rail trip to Wroat. The other document contains a list of the names and addresses of the warforged hired to work in the ruins of Old Sharn. You can add other documents that could act as story hooks for future adventures.</p>
<p>Sergeant Germaine Vilroy (neutral female Brelish human veteran) is <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> and currently has 5 hit points remaining. After getting the information she needed from Germaine, Garra knocked her out using oil of taggit (see &ldquo;Caden d&rsquo;Orien&rdquo; earlier in this adventure). A character can remove the ropes binding the sergeant as an action. If the characters wake up Germaine, she tells the characters to continue pursuing Garra and that she can get help for herself.</p>

<p>A groaning halfling is tied to a wood chair in the center of this room, his shirt stained with blood and sweat, and his head covered in a canvas bag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corrin Delmaco is a male lightfoot halfling who works for the Boromar Clan. The halfling tried to infiltrate Daask and was captured. He is being held in the hideout while Daask agents torture him for information.</p>
<p>Corrin Delmaco is a lawful evil spy with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is Small, has a hit point maximum of 21 (<wc-roll>6d6</wc-roll>), and has 10 hit points remaining.</li>
<li>He has the following racial traits: He can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. He has advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch>. He speaks Common, Halfling, and thieves' cant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Corrin claims to have no idea why Daask abducted him and begs for the characters to free him. A character who succeeds on a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check contested by Corrin&rsquo;s Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check knows the halfling is lying. If pressed, Corrin admits his connection to the Boromar Clan, and tells the characters it would be mean a lot to the powerful halfling family if they freed him.</p>
<p>A character can untie Corrin from the chair as an action. Corrin then flees the scene and tells the Boromars of his rescuers, which could lead to more adventures (see &ldquo;Conclusion&rdquo; at the end of this chapter).</p>

<p>This store sells is run by Gurty, an elderly kenku. If the characters ask Gurty about Garra, the kenku mimics the half-ogre&rsquo;s voice, saying, &ldquo;My coach is leaving soon. Hurry it up, or I&rsquo;ll pluck ya, stupid bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of lightning rail trains stopping and starting elsewhere in Terminus Station echoes throughout the platform. A crowd of people is gathered near a lightning rail train crackling with arcs of blue energy. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re headed to Wroat, you&rsquo;ll have to catch the next one!&rdquo; cries a conductor in the livery of House Orien as the train begins moving out of the station.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A crowd of <wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll> Commoner and <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> Noble gathers on the platform along with six hostile human Bandit who belong to Daask. The bandits are here to cover Garra&rsquo;s escape and attack characters who try to board the departing train.</p>
<p>To catch Garra, the characters need to board the lightning rail train leaving the station. The coach has ten cars: a helm car (at the front), a first-class car, a galley car, a dining car, two standard cars, two sleeper cars, a steerage car, and a cargo car (at the rear).</p>
<p>The characters have 30 seconds (5 rounds) to catch the coach before it leaves Terminus Station. A character can jump onto a lightning rail car by making a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A character who fails this check takes 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage and falls <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> on the platform. At the start of round six, the coach moves 20 feet per round for three rounds before accelerating to top speed.</p>

In this case, keep the initiative order and alternate between the characters stuck on the platform with the Daask bandits and the characters exploring the train. The characters who remain at the station can seek out an adventurous skycoach driver and bribe them to fly after the train before making a DC 13 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check to leap onto the roof of a train car safely. Characters who fail the check take fall <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> on the roof of the car and take bludgeoning damage based on the distance fallen (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> per 10 feet).</p>

When she notices the characters, Garra puts up her hands to indicate she means them no harm. She is impressed that the characters managed to catch up with her. The half-ogre offers a 100 gp bribe to the group for the characters to tell the Sharn Watch she escaped and have that be the end of it. If the characters express interest in joining Daask, she chuckles asks why they&rsquo;d do such a thing, and if she&rsquo;s satisfied with the answer, obliges. Garra pays new recruits 100 gp each, promises there is more reward to come, and says the characters' first task is to help her transport the chest to Droaam from Wroat. If the characters refuse, Garra attacks. Garra is willing to die for Daask and fights accordingly.</p>
<p>Garra doesn&rsquo;t know what is in books or schemas, as these items are written in a coded magical language. She only knows that Niho Koi desires the items.</p>
<p>Garra holds the key to her chest, which weighs 50 pounds. A character who makes a successful DC 13 Dexterity check with <wc-fetch type=item>thieves' tools</wc-fetch> picks the lock, and a character who makes a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check forces the chest open. The chest contains Garra&rsquo;s treasure (see below), thirteen books, and three paper schemas in scroll tubes. Each book and schema is written in a magically coded language that can&rsquo;t be read by the <wc-fetch type=spell>comprehend languages</wc-fetch> spell. Finding a way to read these documents is another adventure.</p>

If the characters explain that they are working with the Sharn Watch to catch a murderer and present their writ, the conductor has the coach halted at the next stop, with guards waiting to verify the characters' claims.</p>

The information contained in these documents is up to you, but it might be dangerous information the Daughters of Sora Kell could weaponize. The characters could face the rising threat of Droaam in future adventures. See the &ldquo;Droaam&rdquo; section earlier in this chapter for more adventure ideas.</p>
<p>There are several other possibilities for future adventures, depending on how this story played out:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the characters killed Garra, they are paid their reward of 50 gp each, and members of the Sharn Watch continue to contract the characters for work.</li>
<li>If the characters agreed to work for Garra, they become members of Daask. If the characters killed Garra, they become enemies of Daask.</li>
<li>If the characters returned Caden d&rsquo;Orien to his father, Alden might ask the characters for help with other tasks, or he might see them as his enemies if they reported him to the Sharn Watch.</li>
<li>If the characters freed Corrin Delmaco (see area T9 of Terminus) or if they killed Garra, the Boromar Clan sees them as potential allies. If the characters ally with Daask, the Boromar Clan sees them as enemies.</li>
<li>The characters' heroics catch the attention of a House Lyrandar airship captain seeking a crew for a dangerous expedition to some far-flung corner of Khorvaire, or perhaps even as far away as Xen&rsquo;drik or Argonnessen. See chapter 2 for possible adventure locations.</li>
