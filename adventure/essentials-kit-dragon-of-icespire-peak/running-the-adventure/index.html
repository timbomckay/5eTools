<p>This book is written for the Dungeon Master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature that appears in the adventure. It also teaches you how to run a D&D game.</p>
<p>The other book that accompanies this one (called &ldquo;the rulebook&rdquo;) contains the information the players need to create and advance their characters (the adventurers and heroes of the story), as well as the rules you need to adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure.</p>

The outcome of that story is determined by the actions and decisions of the adventurersâ€”and, of course, the luck of the dice. You can run <em>Dragon of Icespire Peak</em> for as few as one player or as many as five players. Each player starts with a 1st-level character.</p>
<p>The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the Northâ€”a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by lawless, untamed wilderness. You don&rsquo;t need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure, as everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book.</p>
<p>If this is your first time running a D&D adventure, read the &ldquo;Role of the Dungeon Master&rdquo; section.</p>
<h3 id=role-of-the-dungeon-master>

<p>The DM is a <strong>referee</strong>. When it&rsquo;s not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.</p>
<p>The DM is a <strong>storyteller</strong>. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters that the players must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters' actions.</p>
<p>The DM is a <strong>roleplayer</strong>. The DM plays the monsters and villains in the adventure, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the parts of all the other characters who the adventurers meet, including helpful ones.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you and the players have fun. The rules aren&rsquo;t in charge. You&rsquo;re the DMâ€”you&rsquo;re in charge of the game.</p>
<h4 id=choosing-a-dungeon-master>
<a href=#choosing-a-dungeon-master class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Choosing a Dungeon Master</h4><p>Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case.</p>
<h4 id=dm-tips>
<a href=#dm-tips class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>DM Tips</h4><p>As the DM, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they arise.</p>
<p><strong>When in doubt, make it up</strong>. It&rsquo;s better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the shared story</strong>. D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the words and deeds of their characters. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not a competition</strong>. The DM isn&rsquo;t competing against the player characters. Your job is to referee the rules, run monsters, and keep the story moving.</p>
<p><strong>Be consistent and fair</strong>. If you decide that a rule works a certain way, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play. Treat the rules and your players in a fair, impartial manner.</p>
<p><strong>Modify the adventure to suit your tastes</strong>. The adventure has no prescribed outcome. You can alter any encounter to make it more interesting and fun for your particular group of players.</p>
<p><strong>Keep a notepad and some graph paper handy</strong>. Use the notepad to keep track of details such as the characters' marching order. Graph paper will be helpful if you need to draw a quick map for your players.</p>
<h4 id=improvising-ability-checks>
<a href=#improvising-ability-checks class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Improvising Ability Checks</h4><p>The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation, and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes characters try things that the adventure can&rsquo;t possibly anticipate. You decide whether their attempts are successful.</p>
<p>Ability checks only come into play if there&rsquo;s a genuine chance of succeeding or failing at the task. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don&rsquo;t ask for an ability check. Just tell the player what happens. Conversely, if there&rsquo;s no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>If and when you decide that an ability check is required, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<h5 id=what-kind-of-ability-check>
<a href=#what-kind-of-ability-check class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>What Kind of Ability Check</h5><p>Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use.</p>
<h5 id=how-hard-is-it>
<a href=#how-hard-is-it class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>How Hard Is It</h5><p>Decide whether the task&rsquo;s difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use the appropriate DC.</p>
<p><strong>DC 10 (Easy</strong>). An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>DC 15 (Moderate</strong>). A moderate task requires a higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.</p>
<p><strong>DC 20 (Hard</strong>). Hard tasks include things beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability. Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luckâ€”or a lot of specialized trainingâ€”to pull off a hard task.</p>

<p><strong>Combat Step by Step Cards</strong>. These identical cards outline the order of combat, as described in the rulebook.</p>
<p><strong>Condition Cards</strong>. These cards describe various conditions that can affect creatures in the game. A player whose character is suffering from a condition can keep the card as a reminder, giving it back to you when the condition ends for that character.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative Cards</strong>. After the characters and each group of monsters involved in a combat roll initiative, distribute these cards among the combat participants, from the highest to lowest initiative count. For example, whoever rolls the highest initiative gets the &ldquo;1&rdquo; card and acts first, whoever rolls the second highest initiative gets the &ldquo;2&rdquo; card, and so on. Keep the numbered cards for the creatures you&rsquo;re running.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Charm Card</strong>. This card describes a special charm (see &ldquo;<strong>area Charm of the Storm</strong>.&rdquo; You become charged with the power of the storm, to the extent that tiny sparks crackle in your eyes. You can cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>lightning bolt</wc-fetch> spell (3rd-level version) as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.). Give the card to the player whose character receives the charm. Collect the card when the charm ends for that character.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Item Cards</strong>. When the characters acquire a magic item and identify it, give the players the card for that item. Let the player whose character has the item keep the card for reference until the item is expended or no longer in that character&rsquo;s possession.</p>
<p><strong>Quest Cards</strong>. When a new quest becomes available to the characters, give that quest&rsquo;s card to the players. Collect the card if the characters complete the quest or decide they don&rsquo;t want to complete it.</p>
<p><strong>Sidekick Cards</strong>. If you&rsquo;re running the game for a single player, give the player these cards and let them choose a sidekick. The sidekick&rsquo;s corresponding stat block can be found in the rulebook. If the sidekick dies, collect the card; the player can&rsquo;t choose that sidekick again.</p>

A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren&rsquo;t meant to seeâ€”hence the need for secrecy.</p>
<p>When the characters arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a piece of graph paper, copying what&rsquo;s on your map while omitting details as appropriate. It&rsquo;s not important that your hand-drawn map perfectly match what&rsquo;s in the printed adventure. Focus on getting the shape and dimensions correct, and leave the rest to the players' imaginations.</p>

In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur&rsquo;s Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Bards sing of kings, queens, heroes, and tyrants who died long ago.</p>
<p>On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Fell magic and deadly monsters are the perils one faces when traveling in the Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day&rsquo;s walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</p>

This is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms. Amid a lawless wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, bitter winds, and roaming monsters, the coast holds such great bastions of civilization as the city of Neverwinter, in the shadow of the fuming volcano known as Mount Hotenow.</p>
<p>This map is for the DM&rsquo;s eyes only, as it indicates the locations of places described later in this adventure.

The first session should focus on character creationâ€”one of the most fun aspects of the game. If the players create and equip their characters with time to spare, you can begin the adventure once they&rsquo;re ready to go. Otherwise, congratulate them on building their characters and begin the adventure with the next session.</p>
<p>During character creation, your role as the DM is to let your players build the characters they want, and to help them come up with explanations for how their characters came together to form an adventuring party. If you have only one player, work with that player to come up with their character&rsquo;s backstory, then let the player decide if they want the character to have a sidekick (see &ldquo;<strong>area Running for One Player</strong>&rdquo; below).</p>

These options are summarized in the Character Options table. If there are multiple players in the group, encourage them to choose different classes so that the party has a range of abilities.

<p>While your players follow the steps of character creation as outlined in the rulebook, pay attention to the choices they make. The backgrounds they choose define who their characters were before becoming adventurers, and also include roleplaying hooks in the form of ideals, bonds, and flawsâ€”things that you, as the DM, want to know. For example, if a player chooses the Criminal background, one of the options for the character&rsquo;s bond is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.&rdquo; If that&rsquo;s the character&rsquo;s bond, work with the player to decide who that generous benefactor is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.</li>
<li>Ideally, a sidekick&rsquo;s abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a fighter or rogue.</li>

A few of these terms are described here. For descriptions of rules-specific terms, see the rulebook.</p>
<p><strong>Characters:</strong> This term refers to the adventurers run by the players. They are the protagonists in any D&D adventure. A group of characters or adventurers is called a party.</p>
<p><strong>Nonplayer Characters (NPCs):</strong> This term refers to characters run by the DM. How an NPC behaves is dictated by the adventure and by the DM.</p>
<p><strong>Boxed Text:</strong> At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that&rsquo;s meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to the players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe locations or present bits of scripted dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Stat Block:</strong> Any monster or NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so that the DM can run it effectively. These statistics are presented in a format called a stat block. You&rsquo;ll find the stat blocks needed for this adventure in the &ldquo;Creatures&rdquo; section.</p>
<p><strong>Tenday:</strong> In the Forgotten Realms, a week is ten days long and called a tenday. Each month consists of three tendaysâ€”thirty days total.</p>

Typical of its kind, Cryovain is dim-witted and cruel. The dragon patrols the skies around Icespire Peak, surveying its territory while hunting for food and easy treasure. With each passing day, the dragon&rsquo;s domain grows as it ranges farther across the land, preying on anything it can catch with its claws or freeze to death with its icy breath. Sightings of the dragon are becoming more common, as are its attacks.</p>
<p>A crumbling fortress on the northeast spur of Icespire Peak serves as the dragon&rsquo;s lair. Cryovain seized the icy fortress from a tribe of savage Orc, killing the orc war chief and forcing the tribe&rsquo;s survivors to flee into the foothills and forests. Enraged by the death of their war chief, the orcs have called upon ancient alliesâ€”evil, shapechanging, half-orc spellcasters who bless and advise them. These half-orcs worship Talos, an evil god of storms, and many dwell in the dark depths of Neverwinter Wood. In stormy weather, they gather on remote hilltops to summon Gorthok the Thunder Boar, a primal entity that serves Talos. Like the god it serves, Gorthok delights in destruction.</p>
<p>The orcs aren&rsquo;t the only creatures thrown into upheaval by Cryovain&rsquo;s sudden arrival. A manticore driven from its mountaintop nest by the roaming white dragon has migrated to the foothills and begun terrorizing folk living on the outskirts of the mining town of Phandalin. Other monsters in the region have been similarly displaced.</p>

Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with neighboring dwarves and gnomes. Then an orc horde swept through the area and laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.</p>
<p>In the last three or four years, settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. The new settlement is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. The arrival of a white dragon threatens to destroy all that they&rsquo;ve worked to rebuild.</p>
<p>When you are ready for the adventure to get underway, show the poster map of Phandalin to the players and read the following boxed text aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nestled in the rocky foothills of the snow-capped Sword Mountains is the mining town of Phandalin, which consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings. Crumbling stone ruins surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past.</p>
<p>Phandalin&rsquo;s residents are quiet, hard-working folk who came from distant cities to eke out a life amid the harsh wilderness. They are farmers, stonecutters, blacksmiths, traders, prospectors, and children. The town has no walls and no garrison, but most of the adults keep weapons within easy reach in case the need for arms should arise.</p>
<p>Visitors are welcome here, particularly if they have coin to spend or news to share. The Stonehill Inn at the center of town offers modest lodging and meals. A couple of doors down from the inn, posted outside the townmaster&rsquo;s hall, is a job board for adventurers.</p>

<p>The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is a calculating human woman named Halia Thornton. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and she can become a valuable patron to adventurers who don&rsquo;t cross her.

However, she is out of town for the duration of this adventure.</p>
<p>Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin, and is currently in Neverwinter doing exactly that. In her absence, the shrine is left untended.</p>

Each quest is printed on a card, which you can give to the players when that quest becomes available (see &ldquo;<strong>area Starting Quests</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>area Follow-Up Quests</strong>&rdquo; below). Let the players choose which quest to complete first, second, third, and so on. If the players don&rsquo;t like a particular quest, they are under no obligation to complete it.

Harbin is a pompous, middle-aged banker who lives in a house east of the townmaster&rsquo;s hall. Reports of a white dragon in the area have turned him into a veritable shut-in, and he rarely goes outside except to get food and post new notices calling for adventurers.</p>
<p>Characters who knock on Harbin&rsquo;s door hear his voice on the other side say, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a dragon, know that I&rsquo;m far too thin and bony to make a good meal!&rdquo; No matter what the adventurers do to allay his fears, Harbin refuses to open the door, preferring to talk through it. Other residents who trouble Harbin with complaints receive similar treatment.</p>
<p>If the characters ask him about a quest, Harbin sets them on the right track, offering payment upon their return. When the time comes to pay up, he slips the payment under the door one gold coin at a time.</p>

When the characters embark on a journey to a location, flip to the section of this book that describes that location in detail. For example, if the players choose to undertake the Umbrage Hill Quest, go to the &ldquo;Umbrage Hill&rdquo; section. Each location includes an overview that briefly describes what characters can expect to find there. This overview is followed by information you&rsquo;ll need to run the encounters at that location.</p>
<p><strong>Running Encounters:</strong> This adventure describes what the characters see when they first arrive at a location, and what they&rsquo;ll discover as they explore it. The adventure also tells you how the location&rsquo;s inhabitants react to the characters' arrival.</p>
<p>No encounter has a predetermined outcome. For example, characters who explore Umbrage Hill are likely to encounter a manticore. Although fighting the monster is always an option, characters might decide to negotiate with the manticore instead. Be flexible, particularly when dealing with intelligent monsters. If every encounter becomes a fight to the death, your players might get bored and miss out on some fun roleplaying opportunities. Whenever possible, reward players for being clever. For example, characters who disturb the ankhegs at the Loggers' Camp might be able to escape from the burrowing monsters by jumping in the nearby river. Similarly, characters who are willing to negotiate with the wererats in the Mountain&rsquo;s Toe Gold Mine might be able to forge a truce between the wererats and the miners, ending their conflict so that the mine can be reopened.</p>

<p><strong>Dwarven Excavation Quest</strong>. &ldquo;Dwarf prospectors found ancient dwarven ruins in the mountains southwest of here, and have been working an archaeological dig seeking treasure and relics. They need to be warned that a white dragon has moved into the area. Take the warning to them, then return to Townmaster Harbin Wester to collect a reward of 50 gp.&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, see &ldquo;Dwarven Excavation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Gnomengarde Quest</strong>. &ldquo;A clan of reclusive rock gnomes resides in a small network of caves in the mountains to the southeast. The gnomes of Gnomengarde are known for their magical inventions, and they might have something with which to defeat the dragon. Get whatever you can from them. If you bring back something useful and don&rsquo;t want to keep it for yourselves, Townmaster Harbin Wester will pay you 50 gp for it.&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with &ldquo;Gnomengarde.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Umbrage Hill Quest</strong>. &ldquo;The local midwifeâ€”an acolyte of Chauntea named Adabra Gwynnâ€”lives by herself in a stone windmill on the side of a hill a few miles south of Phandalin. With dragon sightings becoming more common, it&rsquo;s not safe for her to be alone. Urge Adabra to return to Phandalin. Once she&rsquo;s safe, visit Townmaster Harbin Wester to claim a reward of 25 gp.&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with &ldquo;Umbrage Hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Butterskull Ranch Quest</strong>. &ldquo;Orcs have attacked Butterskull Ranch, five miles east of Conyberry along the Triboar Trail! Travel there with haste, assess the damage, and help any way you can. Ranch owner Alfonse &ldquo;Big Al&rdquo; Kalazorn is a retired sheriff who can reward you for your efforts. If he&rsquo;s dead, return to Townmaster Harbin Wester with proof of Kalazorn&rsquo;s demise to receive a reward of 100 gp.&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with &ldquo;Butterskull Ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Loggers' Camp Quest</strong>. &ldquo;Deep in Neverwinter Wood, along the river that flows west toward Neverwinter, is a logging camp. Every two months, Phandalin delivers fresh supplies to the camp, which is run by the half-brother of Phandalin&rsquo;s townmaster, Harbin Wester. Barthen, the local provisioner, has prepared a new delivery. He needs someone to bear the supplies safely to the camp. Return to Harbin Wester with a notice of delivery signed by his half-brother, Tibor Wester, to claim your reward of 100 gp.&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with &ldquo;Loggers' Camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Mountain&rsquo;s Toe Quest</strong>. &ldquo;The Mountain&rsquo;s Toe Gold Mine lies fifteen miles northeast of Phandalin. The new overseer, Don-Jon Raskin, just made the trip from Neverwinter to Phandalin and needs to be escorted to the mine. There&rsquo;s no telling what dangers lie between here and there. Once you deliver Raskin safe and sound, return to Townmaster Harbin Wester to collect a reward of 100 gp.&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with &ldquo;Mountain&rsquo;s Toe Gold Mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the characters complete two follow-up quests, another three follow-up quests are added to the job board:</p>
<p><strong>Axeholm Quest</strong>. &ldquo;Within a mountain fifteen miles south of Phandalin stands the ancient dwarven fortress of Axeholm, which has been sealed for years. If a dragon attack is imminent, the people of Phandalin might need to evacuate and take refuge in Axeholm. To that end, someone needs to open the fortress and make it safe for habitation. Once you accomplish these tasks, return to Townmaster Wester to collect a reward of 250 gp.&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with &ldquo;Axeholm.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Barrow Quest</strong>. &ldquo;The dragon that besets us is not the first to threaten this region. Between here and Neverwinter lies the barrow mound of a warrior whose magical dragon-slaying sword helped fell a green dragon terrorizing the High Road a century ago. Rumor has it the <wc-fetch type=item>dragon slayer</wc-fetch> sword is buried there too. Retrieve it, and let the sword be its own reward!&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with &ldquo;Dragon Barrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Woodland Manse Quest</strong>. &ldquo;The orcs have fallen under the sway of evil spellcasters in Neverwinter Wood, and have been sighted in growing numbers near Falcon&rsquo;s Hunting Lodge. The spellcasters dwell in a ruined manse. Falcon needs someone to make a preemptive strike against it. Destroy the evil in the manse, then expect him to reward you.&rdquo; If the characters undertake this quest, run &ldquo;Falcon&rsquo;s Hunting Lodge&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Woodland Manse.&rdquo;</p>

<a href=#leveling-up class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Leveling Up</h3><p>Characters advance in level by completing quests, using the guidelines for leveling up in the rulebook. Regardless of the number of characters in the party, the rate of advancement is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters gain a level each time they complete a starting quest, until they reach 3rd level. Once they are 3rd level or higher, completing a starting quest has no effect on their level.</li>
<li>Characters gain a level each time they complete two follow-up quests.</li>
<li>Characters gain a level if they slay Cryovain the white dragon.</li>
</ul>

Each time the characters arrive at a location tagged on the map of the Sword Coast or prepare to leave that location, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> and consult the Dragon&rsquo;s Location table to determine Cryovain&rsquo;s current whereabouts. Make your first roll on the table when the adventurers leave Phandalin for the first time.</p>
<p>When the dragon visits a location that is not its lair, it surveys the location from the sky, beyond the reach of ranged weapon attacks. If it spots nothing it can eat, it flies off after circling the location for a minute or two. If it spots something tasty, such as a mule, a horse, or a character, the dragon swoops down and attacks it. Once the dragon kills something, it grabs the carcass and flies off with it. Whatever it takes is then eaten within the hour.</p>
<p>If Cryovain loses more than 10 hit points in battle, the dragon disengages from combat and retreats to its lair at Icespire Hold, remaining there until it finishes a long rest and regains all its hit points. Only at Icespire Hold does the dragon fight to the death.</p>
