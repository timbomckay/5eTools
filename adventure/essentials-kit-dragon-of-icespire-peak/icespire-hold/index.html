A warlord named Delsendra Amzarr built the stronghold, and dwelled there for many years while she and her soldiers kept the orcs of the Sword Mountains in check. When supply lines were cut off by heavy snow and blizzards during a brutal winter, Delsendra and her followers starved to death. Orcs later took over the fortress, which was damaged by an earthquake ten years ago and never repaired.</p>
<p>When Cryovain decided to make Icespire Hold its lair, it stormed the fortress through the crumbled southwest section and ate several orcs before settling on the roof. With a terrible roar, the gorged dragon drove the remaining orcs out of Icespire Hold.</p>
<p>Recently, evil mercenaries calling themselves the Stone-Cold Reavers infiltrated the gatehouse and escaped Cryovain&rsquo;s notice. They assume (incorrectly) that the dragon has amassed a hoard and hidden it in the fortress. The next time the dragon flies off, they plan to steal it. They treat adventurers as they would any other competitorsâ€”either trying to scare them off or killing them.</p>

Other features of the location are summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow Slits:</strong> When using an arrow slit for protection, a creature gains three-quarters cover (see the rulebook) against outside threats. A Medium character can&rsquo;t squeeze through an arrow slit, but a Small character can with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p><strong>Ceilings:</strong> Rooms and passageways in the gatehouse and fortress have 15-foot-high, arched ceilings. Ceilings in the undercroft are 8 feet high and flat.</p>
<p><strong>Doors:</strong> Normal doors are made of wood fitted with rusty iron handles and hinges. Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. Finding a secret door requires a search of the wall and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p><strong>Light:</strong> Interior areas with no natural light to illuminate them are completely dark.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature:</strong> The temperature is slightly above freezing during the day and plunges at night. Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates. On a failed saving throw, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and its speed is halved. The creature freezes to death if it suffers these effects for six consecutive hours. These effects end on the creature after it spends at least an hour in a place of warmth.</p>

Characters might learn of it after experiencing a vision at the Shrine of Savras, or they might search for it on their own. In the latter case, let the players use the poster map of the Sword Coast to plot a search. Icespire Hold is marked on the DM&rsquo;s map (<strong>area below</strong>). Characters spot Icespire Hold if they come within 1 hex of it.</p>
<p>If the characters are ready to confront the dragon but need help finding its lair, use one of the following hooks to get them to Icespire Hold:</p>
<p><strong>Captured Orc</strong>. A dozen Orc attack Phandalin. If the characters are not present during the attack, the townsfolk repel the orcs but suffer losses. One wounded orc is captured alive. This orc speaks Common and knows where the dragon&rsquo;s lair is. The characters can also capture an orc themselves and get the information they need from it.</p>
<p><strong>Tymora&rsquo;s Luck</strong>. A sidekick or friendly NPC suggests that the characters pray for Tymora&rsquo;s blessing at the <strong>area Shrine of Luck</strong>. If one or more characters do so, Tymora&rsquo;s blessing comes after a long rest when a mysterious, cloaked man arrives in town on a riding horse to gather supplies for his companions. The man&rsquo;s name is Dobin Noreth, a neutral evil member of the Stone-Cold Reavers (see the <strong>area sidebar</strong>). Both he and the horse know the way to the dragon&rsquo;s lair, having come from there. Dobin&rsquo;s steed is a retired, well-behaved race horse named Four-Leaf Clover.</p>

En route to the dragon&rsquo;s lair, the characters have the following encounter.</p>
<h3 id=frozen-ogre>

<blockquote>
<p>As you make your way across the cold, windblown foothills of the Sword Mountains, you happen upon a large, prone creature frozen in ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The frozen creature is an ogre that the white dragon killed with its cold breath. The ogre&rsquo;s corpse was too big to carry off, so the dragon left it. A character who examines the scene closely and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain that the ogre was killed within the past 24 hours. The cold of the foothills has kept the ice from thawing.</p>
<p>Frozen in the ice with the ogre is a hefty sack, but it can&rsquo;t be reached or searched until the characters chip or melt away the ice that covers it. The sack contains a rusty dwarven helm, two halves of a splintered wooden shield, a tumbleweed, a crumpled-up cowboy hat, and a sackcloth doll in desperate need of restitching.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clouds partly obscure a stone fortress situated atop the icy spur of a jagged, snow-covered mountain that you recognize as Icespire Peak, a landmark so enormous as to be visible from Phandalin on a clear day. The mountain dwarfs the fortress, which consists of two separate structures joined together by a stone bridge. A narrow, winding path corkscrews up the mountainside to the smaller of the two structures, and appears to be the only safe way to reach it by land. It&rsquo;s an unwelcome path, but not as unwelcome as the cold, howling wind that buffets you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Cryovain is alive, the young white dragon is sleeping on the rooftop of the main fortress (<strong>area area H20</strong>), where it can enjoy the cold mountain air while surveying its domain from over the battlements. It sleeps in a 10-foot-square area in the middle of the roof, away from obstacles, and awakes if one of the following things occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dragon is targeted by a spell or takes damage.</li>
<li>Someone or something makes a noise loud enough to interrupt the dragon&rsquo;s slumber. Noises that qualify include the clap of a <wc-fetch type=spell>thunderwave</wc-fetch> spell, sounds of combat in areas not completely sealed off from the outside by doors, or a whisper in the dragon&rsquo;s ear.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon realizes intruders are near but can&rsquo;t determine their whereabouts, it lets out a roar and takes to the air. As it circles the fortress, it glances around for signs of intrusion. If it finds nothing to attack, it returns to the rooftop and waits for intruders to come to it. The dragon is small enough that it can squeeze through doorways and passageways, but it needs an incentive to enter the fortress because it dislikes confined spaces. Like most white dragons, Cryovain is slow-witted and easily baited.</p>
<p>The howling of the wind prevents Cryovain from hearing intruders who remain relatively quiet. The wind also silences the characters as they follow the icy path (area H1) that leads to and from the gatehouse (areas H2 through H6).</p>

Narrow Trail</h4><p>This narrow trail clings to the mountainside as it twists around and up to the gatehouse. Tracks from horses coming and going along the trail are clearly visible. Characters must traverse the trail in single file. If there&rsquo;s more than one character, determine their marching order and how far apart they&rsquo;re spaced in case it becomes relevant.</p>
<p>The trail is safe, though a 20-foot-long stretch of it is buried under rubble that is difficult terrain (see the rulebook).</p>

This door can be barred shut from within, but its heavy wooden crossbar isn&rsquo;t in place when the characters arrive. They must let themselves in, as no one answers the door if they knock.</p>
<p>The mercenary stationed in <strong>area area H6</strong> watches the trail and alerts her companions in <strong>area area H4</strong> if she sees strangers approaching the gatehouse. Careful not to wake the dragon, the mercenaries allow characters to enter the gatehouse unchallenged.

When they can&rsquo;t find work as sellswords, they resort to brigandry and thievery. After spotting the white dragon, they decided to follow it back to its lair. They&rsquo;re now waiting for it to go hunting so they can plunder Icespire Hold during its absence. Until the dragon leaves, the reavers do everything they can to avoid attracting its attention. If the characters killed the dragon elsewhere, assume that the mercenaries searched the fortress, found nothing, and are now angrily waiting for a companion named Dobin Noreth to return with supplies (see &ldquo;<strong>area Tymora&rsquo;s Luck</strong>").</p>
<p>The Reavers threaten the characters with bodily harm to scare them away, turning to violence if their threats fall on deaf ears. If the characters try to bribe them, the mercenaries realize that it would be easier to rob the characters than accept the bribe. If two or more Reavers are killed or <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>, the others stand down and try to negotiate a truce to ensure their own survival.</p>
<p>Characters encounter the following four Stone-Cold Reavers in Icespire Hold:</p>
<p><strong>Syleen Wintermoon</strong>. The leader of the Stone-Cold Reavers is a lean, brash woman who hails from Neverwinter and keeps her red hair pulled back in a ponytail. Syleen enjoys taking risks, living as though each day will be her last. She lies compulsively and always assumes she&rsquo;s being lied to.</p>
<p><strong>Runa Vokdottir</strong>. A muscular woman with black hair and cold blue eyes, Runa hails from Icewind Dale far to the north. A lifetime of sunless days and frigid nights falsely taught her that cruelty is natural, not evil. Runa speaks few words but is armed with a biting sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>Brakkis Elspaar</strong>. An unshapely man whose best years are behind him, Brakkis is an opportunist who likes following orders, as it frees his mind to think about retirement and dogsâ€”two topics he can&rsquo;t stop talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Jabarl the Orc-Biter</strong>. Jabarl is a rugged, sullen brute with a criminal past that never manages to catch up to him. He&rsquo;s good at scaring people, caving in skulls, and tending to the horses, around which he seems more at ease.</p>

If warned that strangers are near, all the mercenaries greet the new arrivals in the open area between this room and the stables. If the characters reach this area without being spotted, Syleen Wintermoon sits on a stool and sings quietly to herself while sharpening a knife. Sleeping under threadbare blankets nearby are Brakkis Elspaar and Jabarl the Orc-Biter.

The room is decorated with the spoils of war, including impressive-looking furniture that was mostly destroyed when Cryovain attacked. Also heaped about the room are furs, antlers, the rotting heads of Kra&rsquo;s enemies (dwarves, humans, and rival orcs mostly), as well as other trophies.</p>

Crafted by sea elves as a gift to their land-dwelling cousins, it has six branches of red coral worked into its design. The branches can be detached and are worth 25 gp each.</p>

Roof</h4><p>If the characters haven&rsquo;t defeated Cryovain yet, the final encounter with the young white dragon occurs here as it stubbornly defends its new home. The rooftop is enclosed by a 3-foot-high battlement, except in the corners where the wall has collapsed. Cylindrical stone chimneys jut 5 feet above the rooftop but are too narrow for even Small characters to squeeze through. These chimneys connect to the fireplaces in areas <strong>area H12</strong>, <strong>area H13</strong>, <strong>area H14</strong>, and <strong>area H17</strong>.</p>

The ice is difficult terrain (see the rulebook). When a creature other than Cryovain moves on the ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check or fall <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>.</p>

Crypts</h4><p>These rough-hewn passageways contain unmarked stone caskets in alcoves. Sealed within each casket are the bones, rusty armor, and rusty weapons of warriors who fell in battle under Delsendra Amzarr&rsquo;s command.</p>

Empty Crypt and Secret Exit</h4><p>Of the five unmarked stone caskets in this tomb, four are empty. The middle casket contains a dismantled toboggan that takes 10 minutes to assemble. The toboggan was designed for barreling down the mountainsideâ€”a last-ditch escape route that was never used.</p>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic can open it from the outside. The door opens onto a ledge overlooking an icy mountain slope.</p>
