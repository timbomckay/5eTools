In the course of her explorations, the wizard disappeared, and the protective magical wards on her home expired. The house fell into disrepair, then eventually into ruin. Ivy has all but engulfed it in the years since.</p>
<p>Recently, a half-orc anchorite of Talos named Grannoc took over the ruined house and planted seeds at the bottom of its well. From these seeds, a malignant tree grew to fill the well and began spawning evil plant monsters called blights (see &ldquo;<strong>area Blights</strong>&rdquo; in the Creatures chapter). The blights obey Grannoc, who uses them to defend his woodland manse and kill trespassers within the forest.</p>

Its common features are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Ceilings:</strong> Ceilings on the ground floor are 8 feet high and flat. Second-floor ceilings are 15 feet high and peaked, with wooden rafters crossing below them at a height of 10 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Doors:</strong> Normal doors are made of wood, and are so rotted as to be soft and easily breakable (no ability check required). Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. A secret door can be found by a character who searches the surrounding wall and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p><strong>Ivy:</strong> The ivy enveloping the manse is poisonous and makes the walls difficult to climb. Scaling a wall requires a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A creature that comes into contact with ivy must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) poison damage.</p>
<p><strong>Light:</strong> Most locations on the ground floor are dark, as the ivy blocks out the natural light except in areas that are open to the sky (such as the courtyard) or that have openings through which sunlight or moonlight can enter. Rooms and halls on the upper level are dimly lit by natural light that filters through holes in the roof.</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong> Windows are 2½-foot wide, 5-foot-high apertures with wooden shutters but no glass. Those along the outside walls are covered with ivy, which must be cleared away before the shutters can be opened or closed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Describe this location to the players by reading the following boxed text aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following a trail through the woods, you come to a foggy clearing, in the midst of which stands a crumbling two-story manse all but hidden beneath thorny ivy. The large house is set atop a six-foot-high stone foundation, and the main entrance has a balcony above it. Pumpkins grow wild in patches around the manse, with several wild boars feeding among them. The boars snort with contempt as you draw near.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trail heading north off the map leads to the Circle of Thunder. The trail heading west leads to Falcon&rsquo;s Hunting Lodge.</p>

Pumpkin Patches</h4><p>Nine boars graze in the pumpkin patches—one per patch. Of these, six are actual Boar. The other three are Anchorite of Talos in boar form. The anchorites ignore the characters until they try to leave (see &ldquo;<strong>area Leaving the Manse</strong>"). If the characters attack a boar, it flees on its turn by darting into the nearby woods. If the characters attack an anchorite, all of the boars and anchorites retaliate. If you need to determine whether a boar is an anchorite or not, roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll>. On a 5 or 6, the boar is an anchorite in disguise.</p>

As an action, a character can carve open a pumpkin to reveal six servings of seeds within. Any creature that eats a serving of pumpkin seeds as an action regains 1 hit point. If a creature eats more than five servings of pumpkin seeds in 1 hour, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> for <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> hours.</p>

Portico and Balcony</h4><p>Describe the main entrance of the manse as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stone steps climb to a portico with a stone balcony overhanging it at a height of ten feet. Vines wrap around the balcony&rsquo;s support pillars and its crumbling stone railing. The ground-floor entrance features a double door with a giant boar&rsquo;s head crudely carved into it. An unmarred double door stands closed on the balcony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A character can climb up to the balcony with a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. If another character assists, the check is made with advantage. Both sets of double doors are free of ivy and safe to open.</p>

Its upper half has been weakened to the extent that it collapses under 50 pounds or more of weight. A creature on the collapsing stairs must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling onto a bed of wooden spikes planted underneath the staircase.

A fireplace dominates the south side of the room, and a smashed wooden dining table lies in a heap in the eastern half of the room, surrounded by six broken chairs.</p>
<p>If the characters met the shapechanged anchorite of Talos on the way to the loggers' camp and let it get away (see &ldquo;<strong>area A Boar-ing Encounter</strong>"), small twig figures rest on the mantelpiece—one representing each party member (including sidekicks).

</blockquote>
<p>If the orcs in <strong>area area W18</strong> have not yet been dealt with, add the following:</p>

With little room to spread out, the tree has grown into a malformed column of twisted wood with narrow gaps between its curling branches.</p>
<p>Hidden in the shaft are a number of Vine Blight—one blight plus one additional blight for each member of the party, not including sidekicks (maximum five blights). The blights form a descending column, with the closest one 5 feet below the well&rsquo;s mouth. With their <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch>, they can sense intruders in the courtyard. However, they emerge to attack only when they or the Gulthias tree take damage, or when Grannoc (see <strong>area area W10</strong>) commands them to do so. Once the blights are out of the shaft, a Medium or smaller character can climb down it, slipping between the branches of the tree with ease (no ability check needed).</p>
<p>The Gulthias tree is a Huge plant with blood for sap. It has AC 15, 250 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and no actions, reactions, or defenses. Like an ordinary tree, it&rsquo;s immobile. Unless it&rsquo;s completely uprooted, however, it regrows from its roots even if it&rsquo;s reduced to 0 hit points, regaining 1 hit point every 24 hours.</p>
<p>On any night when the moon is blood red, the Gulthias tree can spawn <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> Twig Blight, <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> Needle Blight, or <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> Vine Blight. These blights split from the tree and crawl out of the well, ready to do Grannoc&rsquo;s bidding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This room was once a bedchamber, kitchen, and dining room rolled into one. Four beds stand along the south wall, with shuttered windows and nightstands between them. Against the west wall are four wardrobes and a cabinet full of plain dishware and cutlery. Four chairs surround a small dining table in the northeast corner, and a trestle table strewn with pots and cooking utensils stands near a blackened fireplace. All the furnishings are made of wood.</p>
<p>The ceiling in the southwest corner of the room has collapsed, filling the area below with debris and leaving a jagged hole through which the room above is visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wizard who built the manse had four apprentices. When it became clear that the wizard wasn&rsquo;t coming back, the apprentices pillaged the library (<strong>area area W11</strong>) and fled, taking their personal belongings with them.</p>
<p>Any loud noise in this area alerts the orcs in <strong>area area W18</strong>. On their first turn, they drop down through the hole in the ceiling. On the following turn, they attack.</p>
<p>Adventurers can move tall furniture underneath the hole and climb up it to reach area W18 without having to make an ability check.</p>

Wizard&rsquo;s Laboratory</h4><p>The door on the east side of this room has been smashed down, but any light from the courtyard isn&rsquo;t enough to illuminate the room. Characters with <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> or a light source see the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What used to be some sort of laboratory lies in ruins, its furnishings broken and heaped against the walls. In the middle of the room, painted on the floor with mud, is a ten-foot-wide symbol depicting three lightning bolts joined at their tips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check recognizes the symbol as that of Talos, the evil god of storms. A cleric with the Tempest domain succeeds on the check automatically.</p>
<p>If the characters manage to get this far without alerting Grannoc, they catch him performing a ritual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where the lightning bolts converge, a half-orc wearing hide armor performs an eerie dance while consuming the entrails of a dead possum. Standing around the half-orc are several small twig figures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The half-orc, Grannoc, is an anchorite of Talos. Under his command are a number of Twig Blight—three blights for each character in the party, not including sidekicks. Characters who watch Grannoc without alerting or interrupting him can determine that he&rsquo;s performing a ritual with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check. Grannoc hopes Talos will answer his prayers and rain destruction down upon Falcon&rsquo;s Hunting Lodge. Any interruption by the characters spoils the ritual and incurs Grannoc&rsquo;s wrath.</p>

Upper Arcade</h4><p>This corridor is enclosed by two double doors and four open windows. Characters can easily sidestep the ivy growing in through the windows to the east. If the orcs in area W18 haven&rsquo;t been dispatched yet, the characters hear their raucous talk through the southern double door.</p>

Guest Room</h4><p>This room has been claimed by hostile Orc in league with Grannoc. Four orcs are here, plus an additional orc for each character in the party, not including sidekicks. The orcs are sharpening their weapons in anticipation of an attack on Falcon&rsquo;s Hunting Lodge. The orcs have destroyed this room&rsquo;s once-fine furnishings, leaving nothing of value. A hole in the southwest corner of the floor leads to <strong>area area W9</strong> below.</p>

The attacking force consists of any Anchorite of Talos and Boar in <strong>area area W1</strong> that were not previously killed or forced to flee. In addition, Needle Blight emerge from the woods to join the battle—two blights for each character in the party, not including sidekicks.</p>

Gorthok the Thunder Boar smashes through the lodge&rsquo;s palisade, allowing twenty Orc to storm the lodge.</p>
<p>If the characters aren&rsquo;t present when the lodge is attacked, Falcon and his servants flee on Falcon&rsquo;s riding horse and make their way to Phandalin, surrendering the lodge to the orcs.</p>
