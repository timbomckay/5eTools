<p>Arcturiadoom is designed for four 13th-level characters, and adventurers who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance halfway to 14th level. The lich Arcturia, who dwells on level 23 of Undermountain, is one of Halaster&rsquo;s most accomplished apprentices, arguably the most powerful of the Seven, and a master of transmutation magic. Arcturiadoom is her personal retreat (&ldquo;doom&rdquo; being an archaic term for a lord&rsquo;s domain). Hidden on this level is Arcturia&rsquo;s phylactery, and adventurers would be wise to find and destroy it before facing the lich in battle on level 23.</p>

The fire giants are accompanied by a large force of hobgoblins. Drow have also infiltrated this level of the dungeon, though they have no quarrel with adventurers.</p>

<p>Emberosa hopes to obtain a lost rune of power created by the giants more than forty thousand years ago. She believes dwarves stole the rune from the giants and hid it under Mount Waterdeep. Halaster found the rune and hid it in on level 23, but he has agreed to part with it if the fire giants use their exceptional metal-forging abilities to build a giant construct for him. Work is under way, with the construct being assembled in <strong>area area 15</strong>.</p>
<p>For more information on the giant ordning, see the &ldquo;Giants&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual.</p>

This force is commanded by a hobgoblin warlord named Doomcrown, who is the estranged son of Warlord Azrok (see level 3).</p>
<p>A devout follower of the godslayer Maglubiyet, Doomcrown wants fire giants to ascend to the top of the giant ordning, envisioning their brutal tyranny sweeping across FaerÃ»n. He expects to play an important role in Emberosa&rsquo;s ascension and conquest, and he dreams of ruling what remains of the High Forest once the elves and other forest denizens are purged and the trees are reduced to ashen spines.</p>
<p>Since arriving in Arcturiadoom, however, Doomcrown has developed strange habits. He spends more and more time locked away in his quarters, chasing some strange new obsession. His followers remain loyal, but they worry about the mental state of their warlord.</p>

Consequently, the only wandering monsters of consequence are hobgoblin patrols. A typical patrol consists of four Hobgoblin. Their marching footsteps and clanking armor can be heard well in advance of their arrival, and characters can&rsquo;t be surprised by them. Combat with a patrol is sure to alert other creatures in the vicinity.</p>
<p>If any hobgoblins are defeated while on patrol, subtract their numbers from the guards in <strong>area area 32a</strong>.</p>

These drow belong to House Freth (see level 12). They avoid violent confrontations with adventurers and instead try to turn them against the fire giants and the hobgoblins.</p>

<h4 id=polymorph-traps>
<a href=#polymorph-traps class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Polymorph Traps</h4><p>Throughout Arcturiadoom lie magic traps designed to polymorph humanoids. (Creatures that aren&rsquo;t humanoids are unaffected.) These traps are marked P on map 14. The hobgoblins are aware of these traps and do their best to avoid them. A polymorph trap is marked by a nearly <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> glyph inscribed on a 10-foot-square section of floor. A character searching the area for traps can detect the glyph with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. The first humanoid to pass over the 10-foot-square area triggers the glyph and must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed into a monster with average hit points. All items worn or carried by the creature are absorbed into its new form. The new form is hostile toward all other creatures and must attack any other creatures it can see. Roll a <wc-roll>d10</wc-roll> to determine the creature&rsquo;s new form:</p>
<p>| - | - |
| 1. Carrion crawler | 6. Hook horror |
| 2. Chimera | 7. Manticore |
| 3. Fire elemental | 8. Otyugh |
| 4. Gelatinous cube | 9. Owlbear |
| 5. Gorgon | 10. Wyvern |</p>
<p>When the polymorphed creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form and is stable at 0 hit points. Once a glyph is triggered, it disappears, rendering its space safe to pass through until Arcturia sees fit to replace it. A successful dispel magic spell (DC 17) cast on a glyph removes it.</p>

Worm Tunnel</h4><p>The bore worm on level 13 wanders down here occasionally, looping around a central column of rock before traveling back up. This column supports the cavern&rsquo;s 30-foot-high roof. The cavern also has these features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Double Door</strong>. A double door is framed with carvings of worm-ridden skulls. Carved into the lintel above the double door is a sconce sculpted to resemble a skeletal hand, with a <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spell cast in its palm.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters</strong>. A pair of stalagmites flank the double door. Hiding behind each stalagmite is an <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> drow mage and an <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> quasit.</p>
<p><strong>Rock Formations</strong>. Around the edges of the cavern are more stalagmites and stalactites. More of these formations fill a smaller cavern to the southeast (<strong>area area 1b</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two drow mages are males named Hulziin and Yrrprek. Each wears a cloak pin bearing the insignia of House Freth. They arrived here shortly before the adventurers and have <wc-fetch type=spell>greater invisibility</wc-fetch> spells cast on them. The drow and their two quasit companions try to remain hidden, allowing adventurers to move into Arcturiadoom ahead of them. Once the path is clear, they pass through <strong>area areas 3</strong> and <strong>area 35</strong> on their way to <strong>area area 38</strong>.</p>
<p>One of their kin, Vanar, arrived early to scout and has already slipped inside. The characters might encounter him and his shadow demon in <strong>area area 29</strong>.</p>

Deformed Duergar</h4><p>Characters who enter this cave are soon attacked by a hideously deformed duergar. The creature has enlarged itself to a height of 9 feet.</p>
<p>This creature used to be two separate duergar, a male named Blork and a female named Muatha. Arcturia fused them together into a single creature by using magic that only a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell can undo. Both skulls merged into one bulbous head that has three ears, three eyes, two noses, and two mouths. It has a third arm on the right side of its body, and its left leg splits into two at the knee, giving it three feet. The transformation drove the poor creature insane, and it regards all other creatures as threats that must be destroyed.</p>
<p>The creature is a duergar, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creature has 40 hit points.</li>
<li>It has advantage on Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks and on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>stunned</wc-fetch>, or knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>.</li>
<li>As a bonus action, it can make an attack with its javelin.</li>

Fungus Gardens</h4><p>The creature in <strong>area area 2a</strong> comes here to feed, as do other creatures dwelling in the caverns. The cave has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fungi</strong>. Gardens of fungus sprout from mounds of offal on the uneven floor. The fungi release clouds of dimly luminescent spores that fill the cave like a fine, hanging mist.</p>
<p><strong>Carrion Crawlers</strong>. Four Carrion Crawler dwell here. Two cling to the 10-foot-high ceiling, and two feed on the rotting corpse of a fifth carrion crawler lying amid the fungus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crawlers are natural enemies of the creature in <strong>area area 2a</strong>, which recently killed one of them with a blow from its war pick. They ignore characters who keep a respectful distance.</p>
<p>A character who studies the fungus and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>) check can distinguish edible varieties from poisonous ones, and also ascertains that the spore clouds are harmless. A character unaware of this information who eats fungus has a 50 percent chance of consuming a poisonous variety and must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> for <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> hours.</p>

Standing Gate to Level 12</h4><p>This cave contains a pair of standing stones with an inanimate minotaur skeleton embedded in each one, facing each other. These standing stones form one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). The rules of the gate are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any creature that touches one of the standing stones is targeted by a <wc-fetch type=spell>maze</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 22).</li>
<li>To open the gate, a creature must escape the labyrinth created by the <wc-fetch type=spell>maze</wc-fetch> spell. When it returns, the gate opens for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Characters must be 12th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 12a on level 12</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>

Foyer</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Monsters</strong>. Two male Fire Giant (named Druvax and Zelzzarf) and seven Hobgoblin are sorting through pieces of scrap iron on the floor and tossing them noisily into piles.</p>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Two statues of dwarves flank the double door to the southwest. Each statue stands atop a crumbling, 2-foot-high stone block. The statues have been magically reshaped in gruesome ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arcturia used <wc-fetch type=spell>stone shape</wc-fetch> spells to mutilate the statues, which once depicted proud dwarf warriors. The statue to the west has stony pseudopods sprouting from it, while the statue to the south appears half-melted.</p>
<p>The giants and the hobgoblins aren&rsquo;t happy with drudge work and eagerly hurl themselves into combat if the chance presents itself. The scrap iron was brought down from level 13 and will later be transported to <strong>area area 14</strong> to be eventually melted down and recast.</p>

Prison</h3><p>Arcturia confines living subjects here until she finds time to experiment on them. The 15-foot-high room is engulfed in a permanent antimagic field (see the <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> spell for effects). The room has the following additional features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cells</strong>. Six 10-foot-high cells with arched ceilings are barred with iron portcullises. Lying in the southwest cell is a humanoid corpse clad in plate armor and riddled with arrows.</p>
<p><strong>Lever</strong>. Bolted to the floor in the middle of the room is a 4-foot-wide, 7-foot-long iron plate with a comb-shaped hole in it. An iron lever protrudes from the hole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remains in the southwest cell are those of a female orog who was captured by Arcturia and stripped of her weapons. The hobgoblins found her, shot her full of arrows through the bars, and left her corpse to rot.</p>
<p>The iron lever operates the mechanism that raises and lowers the portcullises by sliding it along the comb-shaped hole in the floor plate. Depending on how the lever is positioned, it can be used to raise any of the portcullises one at a time, or to lower all the portcullises into place.</p>
<p>The portcullises are impervious to weapon damage. The gaps between the bars are 4 inches wide. Closed portcullises are locked in place; forcing one upward requires a successful DC 26 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

The statue stands atop a 3-foot-high stone base. The statue clutches a stone wand and points it toward the floor.</p>
<p>The statue represents Arcturia and is neither magical nor animate. The statue&rsquo;s wand points in the direction of the polymorph trap that is set before it (see &ldquo;<strong>area Polymorph Traps</strong>").

Pressing this button causes two keys tucked under Halaster&rsquo;s robes to clatter onto the floor around the statue&rsquo;s base. Each key is a flat, 6-inch-long piece of mithral worked into a curious shape.</p>
<p>The first key is shaped like an F, the second like a V with a small loop at the bottom. These are two of the six keys required to activate the weapon of mass disintegration in <strong>area area 37</strong>.</p>

Smithy</h3><p>Characters who listen at the doors to this room hear loud hammering from beyond. The 30-foot-high room is warm and contains the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fire Giant</strong>. In the middle of the room, a male fire giant uses a massive hammer and anvil to pound a heated iron fragment into a rounded shape.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Beetles</strong>. Resting on the floor next to the oversized anvil is an iron cage containing fifteen brightly glowing Giant Fire Beetle. (The giant uses the cage as a lantern.)</p>
<p><strong>Iron Pieces</strong>. Wings to the west and east contain pieces of sculpted iron of all shapes and sizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The giant, Hrossk, is hostile toward adventurers. He keeps his greatsword close at hand and hurls large metal cogs instead of rocks. Combat in this room can be heard by the fire giants in <strong>area area 12</strong>, who investigate at once if a fight breaks out.</p>
<p>Hrossk&rsquo;s job is to recast hot iron into body parts for the giant construct in <strong>area area 15</strong>. Without Hrossk, Emberosa lacks the metalsmithing skills needed to finish work on Mecha-Halaster. Hrossk is currently crafting a piece of what will become one of the construct&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The fire beetles can&rsquo;t harm anyone while confined to their cage. Unlatching the cage door requires an action. If released, the beetles attack indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The iron fragments littering the floor include curved sheets of outer plating, as well as internal gears, cogs, spindles, bars, and pipes. These pieces are waiting to be attached to the construct in <strong>area area 15</strong>.</p>

<p>The pits are 70 feet deep but partially filled with scrap metal that reduces their effective depth.

The curved ceilings in these chambers are 20 feet high.</p>
<p>Three Fire Giant (two females named Dralkana and Ingritt and a male named Yarshoss) are stationed here, one at each forge. Their job is to melt down fragments of scrap iron so that Hrossk, the fire giant metalsmith in <strong>area area 11</strong>, can reshape them for the construct in <strong>area area 15</strong>. It&rsquo;s tedious work, and the fire giants are restless and spoiling for a fight.</p>
<p>The fires in the forges are conjured from the Elemental Plane of Fire. A stone lever built into each forge closes a valve in the back of it, extinguishing the flames. Any creature that enters a lit forge or starts its turn in one takes 55 (<wc-roll>10d10</wc-roll>) fire damage.</p>

<p><strong>Pillars</strong>. Three pillars of polished black stone stand in the corners of the room. Attached to each pillar at waist height is a tarnished silver knob.</p>
<p><strong>Tapestry</strong>. A huge, sickly purple tapestry hanging on the west wall undulates as though alive. Its surface is covered with eleven unblinking eyes: one large central eye and ten small peripheral eyes. (Hidden behind the tapestry is a secret door.)</p>
<p><strong>Crystal Door</strong>. A crystal door in one corner of the room stands closed. Beyond the door is a small, magically lit chamber. (See <strong>area area 13b</strong> for details.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All three pillars and their silver knobs radiate auras of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell. Any creature that touches a pillar&rsquo;s silver knob is teleported to <strong>area area 5b</strong>. Once a silver knob has teleported a creature, it disappears.

The lich snared the eye tyrant and used a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell to transform it. In the form of a tapestry, the beholder retains its <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> and can see whatever is in front of it, but nothing behind it. It can&rsquo;t speak, and its movement is limited to harmless flapping. It can&rsquo;t use its Antimagic Cone trait or take any actions or reactions.</p>
<p>Xebekal can be contacted with telepathy. It promises wealth and power to anyone who restores it, but has no intention of honoring its promises. Only a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell can turn the tapestry back into the beholder it once was.</p>
<p>The tapestry has AC 5, 33 hit points, immunity to poison damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, the tapestry is destroyed. The characters gain no XP for killing the beholder in this form, given its present helplessness.</p>

Alteration Chamber</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Crystal Door</strong>. The door to this chamber is made of 3-inch-thick transparent crystal.</p>
<p><strong>Brass Panels</strong>. Embedded in the wall next to the door is a brass panel with four brass buttons arranged in a diamond formation. (A similar panel appears inside the chamber.)</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong>. A crystal dome in the ceiling sheds pale white light, illuminating the whole chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Key</strong>. Lying on the chamber floor is a flat mithral key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The buttons on each brass panel and their effects are as follows:</p>
<p>The <strong>top button</strong> is engraved with an arrow pointing up. Pressing it opens the crystal door, which retracts into the ceiling. This button is locked and cannot be pressed if the door is already up.</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom button</strong> is engraved with an arrow pointing down. Pressing it shuts the crystal door by lowering it back into place. This button is locked and cannot be pressed if the door is already down.</p>
<p>The <strong>left button</strong> is engraved with a tiny human stick figure. The button is locked and cannot be pressed while the crystal door is open. If the button is pressed while the door is closed, the light emanating from the crystal dome on the ceiling flickers, and all creatures in the chamber behind the door magically shrink as though affected by the reduce effect of the <wc-fetch type=spell>enlarge/reduce</wc-fetch> spell (no saving throw allowed). The effect lasts for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The <strong>right button</strong> is engraved with a larger human stick figure and functions like the left button, except the creatures in the alteration chamber are enlarged instead of reduced.</p>
<p>If a magically reduced creature is subjected to the chamber&rsquo;s enlarge effect, or a magically enlarged creature is subjected to the reduce effect, the two alterations cancel each other out, and the creature reverts to normal size. The effects of the chamber aren&rsquo;t cumulativeâ€”a reduced creature that is reduced again or an enlarged creature that is enlarged again doesn&rsquo;t change size further.</p>
<p>Each time the alteration chamber&rsquo;s reduce effect or enlarge effect is activated, roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll>. On a 1, the chamber malfunctions. Instead of the normal effect, all creatures inside the chamber must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (<wc-roll>8d10</wc-roll>) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can replace this damaging effect with a more benign one. For example, the chamber&rsquo;s magic might cause creatures' noses to elongate or turn their skin blue; an alteration of this sort can be undone with a <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>

<p><strong>Double Door</strong>. A 20-foot-tall double door blocks the hallway to the north. Leering skulls are carved around the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scrap metal came from level 13. Whenever the characters leave this area and return, there is a 20 percent chance that Hrossk, the fire giant metalsmith in <strong>area area 11</strong>, is here to collect a choice piece of scrap iron and bring it to area 12 to be melted down and recast.</p>

Mecha-Halaster</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Pillar Sconces</strong>. This hall has a 150-foot-high arched ceiling buttressed by stone pillars that have sconces protruding from them at 10-foot intervals. <wc-fetch type=spell>Continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast on the sconces illuminate the hall.</p>
<p><strong>Giant Construct</strong>. In the middle of the room, lying on its back on the stone-tiled floor, is a 100-foot-tall figure made of molded iron, its feet pointing toward the double door to the south. The construct is missing its head, and there are gaps in its outer shell through which the construct&rsquo;s inner supports and mechanisms can be glimpsed.</p>
<p><strong>Emberosa</strong>. This female fire giant has 221 hit points and the innate magical ability to hurl fire at will (as the fire giant&rsquo;s Rock attack option, except it deals fire damage). She stands on the construct&rsquo;s chest, 20 feet above the floor. Flitting around her are her sidekicks, three Smoke Mephit.</p>
<p><strong>Pit</strong>. At the north end of the room is a 20-foot-deep pit with a dusty stone sarcophagus at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emberosa is inspecting the work of her fellow fire giants and doesn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed. To say she has a temper would be an understatement. If intruders enter the hall, she tries to make quick work of them while her mephits taunt the new arrivals mercilessly. A battle here brings reinforcements rapidly from <strong>area areas 16</strong> and 18.</p>
<p>The construct is made of recast bits of scrap iron plundered from Trobriand&rsquo;s Graveyard (level 13). When complete, the construct will be the spitting image of Halaster Blackcloak himselfâ€”100 feet tall and made of iron. When the time comes to conquer Waterdeep, the Mad Mage plans to use Mecha-Halaster to destroy the city&rsquo;s walking statues. Without its head and the immense magic needed to power it, the iron construct is nothing more than a giant boondoggle. In its current state, it is considered an inanimate object, not a creature. Medium or smaller creatures that squeeze inside it can use the outer shell and inner mechanisms as cover. Bigger creatures can&rsquo;t fit inside the construct.</p>

<p>The sarcophagus at the bottom of the pit has a bas-relief of a laughing dwarf carved into its lid, the rim of which bears the following inscription in Dwarvish: &ldquo;Here lies Lulz Klangphorn, trapsmith. He is survived by his work.&rdquo; The lid can be pushed aside with a singular or combined Strength of 18. The sarcophagus contains nothing but dust, bones, and Lulz&rsquo;s bronzed skull.</p>
<p>Removing Lulz&rsquo;s skull from the sarcophagus causes mechanisms in the surrounding walls to grind and clank loudly, as though a complex trap has been set in motion. The effect, though harmless, is meant to frighten tomb robbers. After 1 minute, the noise stops.</p>

Night and Day</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Timekeeper</strong>. Four pillars support the 20-foot-high ceiling. An iron ring 20 feet in diameter is suspended from iron brackets affixed to the tops of the pillars so that it hangs parallel to the floor 20 feet below. Nested inside this ring is a circular iron disk of slightly smaller diameter with a symbol of the sun embossed on one side and a symbol of the moon on the opposite side. Directly above the ring and the disk is a 10-foot-deep, dome-shaped concavity in the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Nestled in alcoves are two life-size statues of robed human wizards, their faces obscured under stony cowls and their arms raised toward the iron disk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room is one large timekeeping device. Every day at dawn and at dusk, the wizard statues exert <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> magical force upon the suspended iron disk, causing it to flip over within its circular frame like a coin. During the day, the sun symbol is visible on the disk&rsquo;s underside; at night, the disk displays the moon symbol on its underside. When the disk rotates, half of it swings up into the dome-shaped concavity in the ceiling. The lower half swings downward, with 10 feet of clearance between its outer edge and the floor.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals auras of evocation magic and transmutation magic around the statues, which defy all attempts to move or break them. If a creature attempts to turn the disk manually, the statues discharge lightning that fills the room. All creatures in the room at that moment must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures in direct contact with the iron ring or the disk, as well as creatures clad in metal armor, have disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>

<p><strong>Chalkboards</strong>. Mounted on the walls are several blackboards on which arcane phrases and formulas are written in chalk.</p>
<p><strong>Table Trap</strong>. A wooden table in the middle of the room bears a collection of dusty flasks and beakers. The table is draped in cobwebs and obviously hasn&rsquo;t been disturbed in a long time. The paraphernalia is meant to distract viewers from the polymorph trap upon which the table rests (see &ldquo;<strong>area Polymorph Traps</strong>").</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chalk scribblings were left by one of Arcturia&rsquo;s failed apprentices. Any character who studies the markings and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check can tell that they are attempts by one individual to unravel the secrets of spells beyond their comprehension. Spellcasters who have the <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>flesh to stone</wc-fetch> spells on their spell lists can tell that those are the spells being researched, though neither spell can be learned from these incomplete scribblings.</p>

Guffaw the Stone Eater</h4><p>This room contains the smashed remains of a dwarf statue and a plump deep gnome (svirfneblin) named Guffaw Gravelstock, who was plucked from his Underdark gem mine by Arcturia. He is unfamiliar with Undermountain.</p>
<p>Arcturia&rsquo;s magic has given the gnome an insatiable appetite for carved stone. He uses his war pick to break up the statue and is devouring it slowly, one piece at a time. He can&rsquo;t keep himself from stopping to eat any carved stone he seesâ€”and there&rsquo;s no end to how much he can consume. He begs to be left alone so he can finish his meal in peace. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 19) cast on Guffaw rids him of his unique magical malady.</p>

<p><strong>Shelves</strong>. The curved walls are lined with stone shelves.</p>
<p><strong>Smashed Jars</strong>. Hundreds of jars of body parts lie smashed on the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A hobgoblin accidentally set off a polymorph trap and was transformed into this hook horror. The other hobgoblins decided to trap it in this room as a joke. Lacking hands, the hook horror couldn&rsquo;t open the doors to escape, and it swept the bottles off the shelves in a rage, spilling their contents.</p>
<p>When the hook horror drops to 0 hit points, it turns back into an <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> hobgoblin named Jarrk. Despite his recent misadventure, Jarrk is fanatically loyal to Doomcrown and would never willingly betray him.</p>
<p>Arcturia collected body parts from all sorts of Underdark specimens. Characters who search through the detritus find moth wings, beetle shells, darkmantle eyes, stirge hooks, flumph tendrils, troglodyte claws, demon ichor, gelatinous residue, and other worthless creepy bits. At your discretion, some useful spell components might lie amid the refuse.</p>

<p><strong>Table</strong>. A large stone table stands in the middle of the room.

<p>The 1-foot black cube is an ebony-framed box fitted with panes of black glass. The box has a hinged lid and radiates an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell. When a Tiny beast small enough to fit in the box (such as a rat or a lizard) is placed inside and the lid is closed tightly, the box magically transforms it into some other Tiny beast (your choice) unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The box can do this eight more times before its magic is fully spent, whereupon it crumbles to sand.</p>
<p>The folded gray blanket upon which the box rests is, in fact, the carefully removed skin of a doppelganger. Other items on the table include a jar of cockatrice tongues, a block of soft clay (the material component for the <wc-fetch type=spell>stone shape</wc-fetch> spell) wrapped in moist cloth, and a wooden coffer labeled &ldquo;Polymorph&rdquo; containing a dozen caterpillar cocoons (material components for the <wc-fetch type=spell>polymorph</wc-fetch> spell).</p>

Illithid&rsquo;s Assistant</h3><p>This room was reserved for Arcturia&rsquo;s mind flayer assistant, which met a grisly end in <strong>area area 29</strong>. It has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Decor</strong>. The stone walls are sculpted to resemble tentacles entwining around and through bleached human skulls embedded in the stone.</p>
<p><strong>Slime Pool</strong>. In the middle of the floor is a shallow oval pool filled with dark, foul-smelling slime. (The slime has a soothing effect on mind flayers but no magical properties to speak of.)</p>
<p><strong>Assistant</strong>. Standing in the eastern corner of the room, facing the corner, is a male human wearing nothing but a leather harness and a loincloth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The harness-wearing human is Ellix Gaspar (NE male Tethyrian human mage with no spells prepared). He holds a half-eaten loaf of bread. Arcturia pulled him out of Dweomercore (level 9) a few months ago to serve as her assistant, only to find him too obnoxious to bear. She cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>feeblemind</wc-fetch> spell on him and gave him to her mind flayer assistant, who promptly forced him to don new apparel befitting his station.</p>
<p>In his current state, Ellix is vacant-eyed and barely responsive, with a tendency to trip over his own feet and drool uncontrollably. He has a tenday left before he can attempt another saving throw to end the <wc-fetch type=spell>feeblemind</wc-fetch> effect. If he regains his senses, he smartly tries to flee Undermountain with the last shreds of his sanity and dignity. He doesn&rsquo;t know what happened to his spellbook (Arcturia hid it in <strong>area area 40b</strong>), but once his faculties return, he recalls the layout of this level and how to return to the surface.</p>

Doomcrown&rsquo;s Quarters</h3><p><strong>Monsters</strong>. If he hasn&rsquo;t been drawn elsewhere, Doomcrown the hobgoblin warlord is here, attended by a flumph that speaks to him telepathically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Underdark Model</strong>. Standing about the room are six 7-foot-tall, stalagmite-shaped spires made of tiny rectangular blocks, with a half-finished seventh tower under construction.</p>
<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. Furnishings include a wooden bed, an overstuffed leather chair with a matching ottoman, a stone shelf holding a wooden cask of ale, a handsomely carved stone table strewn with mason&rsquo;s tools and bits of stone, and a heavy wooden seafarer&rsquo;s trunk with a smashed lock.</p>
<p><strong>Tapestry</strong>. On the south wall hangs an old, faded tapestry that depicts a beautiful crystal cavern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days after settling in Arcturiadoom, the hobgoblin warlord commanded his underlings to bring him a set of mason&rsquo;s tools. Some old tools were gathered and promptly delivered to him. In the days since, Doomcrown has been carving rectangular blocks of stone (each 2 inches wide, 4 inches long, and 1 inch thick) and using them to build odd, tower-like structures resembling stalagmites. The endeavor has helped alleviate his boredom, even if he doesn&rsquo;t know exactly why he&rsquo;s building them. The answer lies with his strange companion.</p>
<p>Until recently, this flumph surreptitiously fed on the mental energy of Arcturia&rsquo;s mind flayer assistant. The illithid&rsquo;s sudden death (see <strong>area area 29</strong>) cut off the flumph&rsquo;s food supply. Fortunately, it can get by for some time without needing to feed on more psionic energy. It shacked up with Doomcrown and has been trying to convince him to reform. The hobgoblin has proven to be stubbornly, irredeemably evil, but their lengthy telepathic contact has caused Doomcrown to exhibit odd traits, including a subconscious need to recreate the flumph&rsquo;s homeâ€”the Underdarkâ€”out of building blocks. The flumph knows that its longing to return home is affecting the hobgoblin&rsquo;s behavior, but it relies on Doomcrown for protection. If the two become separated, the flumph opts to return to the Underdark.</p>
<p>The characters can befriend the flumph and coax it into joining the party for a while. It has encountered adventurers in Undermountain before and is generally quite fond of them and their tales of the surface world.</p>

The gas spore continues to shriek until the disturbance moves out of range and for <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> rounds afterward.</p>
<p>The shrieking of the gas spore alerts the hobgoblins in <strong>area areas 32c</strong> and <strong>area 33</strong>, who come to investigate.</p>

Weapon of Mass Disintegration</h3><p>In the event that her experiments got out of hand or her enemies tracked her down, Arcturia built this chamber to purge them all at once while protecting herself and her apprentices (of which she currently has none). The chamber has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plated Walls</strong>. At the end of a short hallway is a 20-foot-high domed chamber with seven narrow alcoves. Every surface is covered with gleaming mithral plates. Each alcove is brightly lit by the yellow glow of a small crystal dome embedded in its 8-foot-high ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Key Shapes</strong>. Set into the mithral-plated walls between the alcoves are six key-shaped indentations at chest height. Each indentation is 6 inches long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each alcove is 8 feet tall and 4 feet deep, and narrows in width from 3 feet to 1 foot. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals a strong aura of abjuration magic engulfing each alcove, which is just spacious enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. The crystal dome in the ceiling is the source of the alcove&rsquo;s magic, and destroying its globe renders an alcove dark and powerless. Each dome has AC 11, a damage threshold of 10, 1 hit point, and immunity to acid, fire, poison, and psychic damage.</p>

Each conforms in shape to one of the six indentations in the walls, which are (from left to right, going clockwise around the room): an upside-down Y, a backward J with a small loop at the top, an upside-down F, an upside-down U, a V with a small loop at the bottom, and an H missing its top left stem. When the six keys (located in <strong>area areas 7</strong>, <strong>area 10</strong>, <strong>area 13b</strong>, <strong>area 27</strong>, and <strong>area 39a</strong>) are placed in their corresponding indentations, a <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell counts down from 20 seconds (in Common). At the end of the countdown, there is an ear-splitting whine, and a powerful spell deals 150 force damage to every creature on level 14 of Undermountain (no saving throw allowed). Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this effect is immediately disintegrated and reduced to a pile of dust. The spell also disintegrates the six mithral keys.</p>
<p>Creatures that are standing in the lit alcoves when the spell goes off are unharmed, as are creatures inside an antimagic field. (The antimagic fields in <strong>area areas 4</strong> and <strong>area 32</strong> protect the creatures there.)</p>

Guest Quarters</h3><p>Arcturia keeps this room for special guests, such as Halaster or visiting wizards who have magic to trade. Its features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. A large canopied bed dominates the eastern alcove. At the foot of the bed rests a large iron chest with a flat lid and clawed feet. An owlbear rug is splayed across the floor in front of the chest and the bed.</p>
<p><strong>Alcove</strong>. A black curtain conceals an alcove to the southwest. In front of the curtain is an overstuffed leather chair and a small table with a crystal decanter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The alcove contains a stone statue that lacks fine features, resembling a blank-faced humanoid. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the statue, which alters its form to mimic the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid that touches it. The statue has no other properties.</p>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic emanating from inside the chest.</p>
<p>The chest is empty except for a magic mirror fastened to the inside of its lid. Any creature that sees its reflection in the mirror is targeted by a <wc-fetch type=spell>flesh to stone</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 20). Once the spell has been triggered, the mirror ceases to be magical.</p>

<p>The seal has AC 17, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the seal is destroyed, the rakshasa bound to these chambers can escape.</p>

Gold and Black Boudoir</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Light</strong>. The walls and ceiling are painted gold. Mounted to them are black iron sconces with <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast on them. These fires cast the entire room in bright, flickering light.</p>
<p><strong>Carpet and Cushions</strong>. Thick, wall-to-wall carpeting with alternating gold and black zigzagging patterns covers the floor, with a few soft, gold silk cushions strewn about.</p>
<p><strong>Hammocks</strong>. Two tasseled hammocks are stretched between four black pillars near the east wall. Napping in one of them is a beautiful young man wearing gold sandals and a golden silk skirt. (The man is Alussiarr, a rakshasa using a <wc-fetch type=spell>disguise self</wc-fetch> spell to mask its true form.)</p>
<p><strong>Braziers</strong>. Two braziers made of carved black basalt rest in the middle of the floor. Smoldering blocks of incense in each brazier fill the room with a pungent but pleasant aroma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rakshasa is bound to these boudoirs and can&rsquo;t travel beyond <strong>area area 39</strong>, even through the use of spells, as long as the circular seal above the doors remains in place. (Spells that would transport the rakshasa away from the area simply fail.) Arcturia trapped the rakshasa here years ago and draws blood from the fiend to fuel her terrible transmutation rituals.</p>
<p>Alussiarr has no beef with the adventurers and doesn&rsquo;t want to distress them by revealing its true form. It does, however, ask them to set it free by breaking the seal outside the room. If the characters do so, the rakshasa turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and makes its way out of Undermountain with the goal of working all manner of evil in Waterdeepâ€”but not before telling the heroes where they can find Arcturia&rsquo;s spellbook (<strong>area area 40b</strong>) and phylactery (<strong>area area 40c</strong>), as well as the command word to reveal the bookshelves in <strong>area area 40b</strong>. It also gives them a flat, 6-inch-long mithral key shaped like a Y, and tells them it&rsquo;s one of six keys required to activate the weapon of mass disintegration in <strong>area area 37</strong>. Alussiarr doesn&rsquo;t know where the other five keys are kept.</p>
<p>If the characters haggle with the rakshasa, it also vows to provide up to three additional pieces of useful information in exchange for its freedom, such as the way to level 15. If the characters refuse to help Alussiarr, the rakshasa shrugs its shoulders, returns to its nap, and gives them nothing in return. It has waited years to escapeâ€”it can wait a few more.</p>

<li>Characters must be 14th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

<p><strong>Chandeliers</strong>. Four crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling, bathing the chamber in magical light.</p>
<p><strong>Harpsichord</strong>. A living unseen servant (see appendix A) plays a harpsichord in the southeast corner. Because the unseen servant is <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>, the harpsichord seems to be playing by itself.</p>
<p><strong>Dancers</strong>. Waltzing about the room are a resplendently dressed man and woman. The man wears a gold ruffled shirt and blue trousers, while the woman wears a ruffled blue ball gown and a gold tiara.</p>

<p>The living unseen servant plays the harpsichord tirelessly and fights only in self-defense.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals auras of transmutation magic around the dancers who, in truth, are a mated pair of Young Blue Dragon. The dragons are Arcturia&rsquo;s guests, and their names are Nystalancer and Venasorrn. With the help of Arcturia&rsquo;s magic, they are experiencing what it&rsquo;s like to be human and pay no attention to new arrivals. If the music stops or either of them is touched or harmed by another creature, the dragons revert to their true forms simultaneously and attack. Their clothing and jewelry merge into their new forms. Arcturiadoom is not their lair, and they keep no treasure here.</p>

<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. Set into the north wall is a secret door that swings open into area 40b.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dwarf statue is inseparable from its base, and its base is inseparable from the floor. If anyone other than Arcturia opens the secret door, the statue transforms into a 6-inch-thick wall of stone that bisects the room from east to west, creating separate chambers to the north and south.

<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals auras of transmutation magic around the pedestal and rectangular sections of the north wall where hidden bookshelves magically emerge (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The pedestal is a Small object with AC 15, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Under certain conditions, it transforms into a nalfeshnee (see area 40c). The pedestal also transforms if it takes damage. With Halaster&rsquo;s help, Arcturia pressed the demon into service. Its primary task is to guard the lich&rsquo;s phylactery.

If the dragons in <strong>area area 39c</strong> are still alive, Arcturia bribes them into guarding the tunnels leading to levels 13 and 15.</p>
<p>Defeating Emberosa and her giants stalls the progress on Mecha-Halaster, but only until Halaster finds new metalsmiths (perhaps a band of azers) to continue the work. The Mad Mage considers the hobgoblins expendable.</p>
