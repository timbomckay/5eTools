<p>Designed for four 8th-level characters, this level of Undermountain contains enough XP to advance such a group halfway to 9th level. The Twisted Caverns feature an aboleth, which is a legendary monster. Review the &ldquo;Aboleth&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual before running this level of the dungeon to help you run the monster effectively.</p>

The drow of House Auvryndar watch this conflict intently, waiting to see who comes out on top before making any push of their own. Various other Underdark species vie for a place in these caverns.</p>

Its presence has tainted the underground river, killing off fish and other river dwellers that provide sustenance to the kuo-toa. Illuun plans to take over the entire level as a step toward gaining control of Undermountain and then Waterdeep.</p>
<p>The aboleth rarely leaves its watery lair and relies on its servants to capture new slaves.</p>

These forces report to T&rsquo;rissa Auvryndar on level 3 and are preparing to challenge whoever perseveres in the conflict between the aboleth and the kuo-toa. These drow control access to one of the magic gates on this level.</p>

They have taken refuge in <strong>area areas 20</strong> and <strong>area 21</strong> while the kuo-toa archpriest, Noolgaloop, creates an idol of a new god. The archpriest hopes the god will come to life and destroy the aboleth. Noolgaloop is using random items and the body parts of various creatures to craft the idol.</p>
<p>The kuo-toa don&rsquo;t trust drow and attack them on sight, but they tolerate non-drow adventurers who agree to help bring Noolgaloop&rsquo;s vile god to life or are willing to face the aboleth in battle.</p>

Many of these fungi are edible or have useful properties. Species of fungus found on this level and elsewhere in Undermountain include the following.</p>
<h4 id=barrelstalk>
<a href=#barrelstalk class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Barrelstalk</h4><p>A barrelstalk is a cask-shaped fungus that can be tapped and drained of the water inside it. A single barrelstalk contains <wc-roll>1d4 + 4</wc-roll> gallons of fresh water. Its husk provides <wc-roll>1d6 + 4</wc-roll> pounds of food.</p>
<h4 id=bluecap>
<a href=#bluecap class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Bluecap</h4><p>Dubbed &ldquo;the grain of the Underdark,&rdquo; a bluecap is a tall, slender mushroom with a bright blue, bell-shaped cap. Although bluecaps are inedible, their spores can be ground to make a nutritious, bland flour. Bread made from bluecap flour is known as sporebread or bluebread. One loaf is equivalent to 1 pound of food.</p>
<h4 id=ripplebark>
<a href=#ripplebark class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Ripplebark</h4><p>This shelf-like fungus resembles a mass of rotting flesh, but it&rsquo;s surprisingly edible. Though it can be eaten raw, it tastes better roasted. A single sheet of ripplebark yields <wc-roll>1d4 + 6</wc-roll> pounds of food.</p>
<h4 id=timmask>
<a href=#timmask class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Timmask</h4><p>Known as &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s mushroom,&rdquo; a timmask is a 2-foot-tall toadstool with orange and red stripes across its beige cap. Uprooting or destroying a timmask causes it to expel a 15-foot-radius cloud of poisonous spores. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch>. While <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> in this way, a creature is under the effect of a <wc-fetch type=spell>confusion</wc-fetch> spell with a duration of 1 minute. When the spell effect ends, the <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> condition also ends.</p>
<h4 id=trillimac>
<a href=#trillimac class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Trillimac</h4><p>A trillimac is a mushroom that grows to a height of 4 to 5 feet and has a broad, gray-green cap with a light gray stalk. The cap&rsquo;s leathery surface can be cut and cleaned for use in making maps, hats, and scrolls; its surface takes on dyes and inks especially well. The stalk can be cleaned, soaked in water for an hour, then dried to make a palatable food akin to bread. Each trillimac stalk provides <wc-roll>1d6 + 4</wc-roll> pounds of food.</p>
<h4 id=tongue-of-madness>
<a href=#tongue-of-madness class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Tongue of Madness</h4><p>A tongue of madness looks like a large human tongue. Although it is edible, it holds no nutritional value. A creature that eats this fungus must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or compulsively speak aloud its every thought for the next hour. The effect can be ended with a <wc-fetch type=spell>lesser restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>
<h4 id=zurkhwood>
<a href=#zurkhwood class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Zurkhwood</h4><p>A zurkhwood is a mushroom that can grow up to 40 feet high. Its large, grain-like spores are edible (one specimen provides <wc-roll>1d4 + 4</wc-roll> pounds of food), but the fungus is more important for its hard and woody stalk. Zurkhwood is one of the few sources of timber in the Underdark; it is used to make furniture, containers, bridges, and rafts, among other things. Skilled crafters can use stains, sanding, and polishing to bring out different patterns in a zurkhwood stalk.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, all tunnels on this level are 20 feet high, and caverns are 30 to 50 feet high. Most of the floors on this level are uneven and covered in dirt and bat guano. Because of this soft ground, Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) checks made to track creatures on this level are made with advantage.</p>

<p>Characters who search for tracks and succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check find several large, bare footprints made by the ettin who regularly feeds on the mushrooms in this cavern.</p>

<p><strong>Fungi</strong>. Barrelstalk, bluecap, and ripplebark fungi grow in irregular patches throughout the cavern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ettin&rsquo;s heads are named Jibber and Jabber, and they get along wellâ€”an unusual state of affairs for an ettin. This situation might be the result of the ettin&rsquo;s having a comfortable home and all the food it could desire. The ettin also has a friendly neighbor in the Alchemist (see <strong>area area 4</strong>), who provides Jibber-Jabber with compost that transforms the water in barrelstalk mushrooms into mead. The only thing Jibber-Jabber is missing in its simple life is treasure to ogle. If the characters offer it 50 gp or more in coins, gems, and shiny art objects, the ettin allows them to pass through its domain and even harvest some fungus if they please. Jibber-Jabber might also impart the following useful information.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Spider people&rdquo; (drow) are living in the caves to the east. They are new neighbors.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;fishy folk&rdquo; (kuo-toa) and the &ldquo;stinky lizards&rdquo; (troglodytes) seem troubled and are moving about more than usual. (The ettin has not yet encountered the aboleth and knows nothing about its conflict with the kuo-toa.)</li>

<p><strong>Fungi</strong>. Gardens of barrelstalk, bluecap, timmask, and trillimac fill the cavern. Between the garden patches meander paths that lead to and from the various exits.</p>
<p><strong>Piercers</strong>. Stalactites cover the ceiling of the wide tunnel that leads south (to <strong>area area 5</strong>). Eight Piercer lurk among them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who searches for tracks along a path can make a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check. On a check total of 20 or higher, the character finds the back-and-forth tracks of several bugbears, a troll, and a hook horror.</p>
<p>Characters who have <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> or light sources bright enough to illuminate the ceiling can avoid piercer drops by steering clear of the stalactite formations, and attempts to do so are automatically successful. If no such attempts are made, a single piercer drops on the first light-carrying creature to cross the cavern. Whether it hits or misses, this piercer can&rsquo;t attack again until it makes the long, slow climb back to the cavern ceiling. After the first piercer drops, avoiding the cavern&rsquo;s stalactite formations becomes a simple matter.</p>

The Alchemist</h3><p>In this cavern, a green slaad posing as a human alchemist makes its home. Its lair has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gourds</strong>. The walls are set with shelves at various heights. They hold numerous gourds, most of which contain failed alchemical elixirs.</p>
<p><strong>Stone Block</strong>. A rough-hewn block of stone in the middle of the cave serves as a table. It is covered with a set of alchemist&rsquo;s supplies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost a year ago, the green slaad was drawn to Undermountain, deprived of its control gem, and set loose by Halaster. It has explored several levels of the dungeon in its quest to find the gem. For now, it has adopted the guise of a scatterbrained, shabbily dressed young man who has, for reasons he would rather not divulge, set up an alchemist&rsquo;s lab in this cave. The slaad refers to itself only as &ldquo;the Alchemist&rdquo; and claims to have been kidnapped by Halaster from someplace it can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>The Alchemist bargains with creatures for materials it needs, trading potions for fungi and equipment. What it&rsquo;s really looking for is its control gem, which it senses is close by (see <strong>area area 21a</strong>). It doesn&rsquo;t want help finding the gem, though, for fear that the treasure might fall into the hands of those who try to control the slaad. If the characters obtain the gem and return it to the Alchemist, it cheers, turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>, and flees with the gem.</p>
<p>If the characters seem interested in knowing more about the Twisted Caverns, the slaad warns them about the ropers in <strong>area area 6</strong>. Also, it has struck up a friendship with the &ldquo;two-headed giant&rdquo; in <strong>area area 2</strong> and urges the characters to speak with it, since it has lived on this level for a long time.</p>

The Alchemist has no use for coins, gemstones, art objects, or magic items. Each time the characters pay the Alchemist a visit, it has one of each of the potions described below available to trade. Each potion is a common magic item. It keeps these potions on its person, and a sneaky character can try to pilfer one with a successful Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Sleight of Hand</wc-fetch>) check contested by the slaad&rsquo;s Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

A former adventurer, she was driven insane by contact with demons in the Underdark. A <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic is needed to restore her sanity, without which Darribeth suffers from hallucinations and paranoia. If the characters approach her in a calm manner, Darribeth smiles and says to the toad on her knee, &ldquo;Look, Teeha! I told you they&rsquo;re not demons. I wonder if Urgala sent them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darribeth desperately wants to get back to her wife Urgala, whom she hasn&rsquo;t seen in a decade. When last they were together, Urgala and Darribeth were living in Amphail, a town north of Waterdeep. In the intervening years, Urgala moved farther north to the frontier town of Triboar, where she took over a modest inn called Northshield House. (See the adventure Storm King&rsquo;s Thunder for more information on Urgala Meltimer and her inn.)</p>
<p>If her sanity is restored, Darribeth becomes her normal selfâ€”a curious and kind woman with a flair for magic who doesn&rsquo;t mind bending rules for the greater good. She speaks Common, Dwarvish, Halfling, and Undercommon.</p>
<p>Darribeth has a <wc-fetch type=item>rope of climbing</wc-fetch> that belonged to a colleague who perished in the Underdark. She offers it as payment for getting her back to the surface. In addition, if any wizards are among her rescuers, she lets them copy spells from her spellbook (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>Once restored to her right mind and borne safely to Waterdeep, Darribeth makes plans to return to Amphail. There, she learns what became of her wife and reunites with Urgala in Triboar. If the characters make the journey with Darribeth and all is well at Northshield House, Urgala is so delighted by their act of kindness that she offers them free room and board for as long as the inn remains standing. Urgala and Darribeth remain lifelong friends of the characters henceforth.</p>

<p><strong>Tripwires</strong>. The uneven rock floor is dotted with small stalagmites, between which run nearly <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> trip wires made of webbing. These web strands set off hidden rockfall traps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The driders in <strong>area area 10</strong> have strung thin web strands between some of the stalagmites, creating trip wires. Any creature that enters a square marked T on the map has a 50 percent chance of breaking a strand and triggering a trap that releases rocks from a hidden crevice in the ceiling. If a trap triggers, all creatures occupying the trapped square must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a falling rock for 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage. In addition, the sound of the falling rocks alerts the driders in <strong>area area 10</strong>.</p>
<p>A character adjacent to a trapped square or in a trapped square can spot the trip wires with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check, then track the thin webs to the point in the ceiling where the rocks are hidden.

<p>Carved into the arch are six stone niches, each one containing a small stone figurine that weighs 1 pound. The figurines represent a black dragon, a unicorn, an umber hulk, an owlbear, a minotaur, and a manticore.

<p>The arch is one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). Its rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the horn of the unicorn figurine is inserted into the hole in the moon symbol, the gate opens for 1 minute. None of the other figurines have protrusions that fit in the hole.</li>
<li>Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. The cave contains two sleeping pallets and a zurkhwood chest. A skewered darkmantle cooks over a spider-shaped bronze brazier filled with flaming coals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If she had her way, Melith would launch a full-scale assault on the kuo-toa, wipe them out, and then deal with the aboleth. As things are, she relies on her sister, T&rsquo;rissa Auvryndar (see level 3), for soldiers, and T&rsquo;rissa does not support such a strategy. So, armed with only a small force, Melith has been forced to watch and wait as the aboleth and the kuo-toa plot to annihilate one another.</p>
<p>Melith is happy to let adventurers meddle in the war between the aboleth and the kuo-toa. If the characters approach her peacefully, she suggests a temporaryâ€”but mutually beneficialâ€”alliance. Melith knows that the only route between this level of Undermountain and the next one down is the underground river. If the characters slay the aboleth or the kuo-toa archpriest and return to her with proof of its demise, Melith promises to furnish them with a raft that they can use to navigate the underground river and continue their descent through Undermountain. Such a raft is stored in <strong>area area 14</strong>, and Melith makes good on her promise.</p>
<p>Though she has great affection for Melith, Thirza sees any alliance with the characters as an opportunity to elevate herself in the eyes of Melith&rsquo;s mother, Vlonwelv. After Melith concludes her business with the characters, Thirza prepares and casts a <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spell to contact Vlonwelv. She warns Vlonwelv that Melith has released a group of adventurers from her custody instead of killing them. After thanking Thirza for the information, Vlonwelv curses her daughter&rsquo;s foolishness and awaits the adventurers' arrival.</p>

Zurkhwood Grove</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Ceiling</strong>. This immense cavern is 50 feet high.</p>
<p><strong>Fungi</strong>. A forest of zurkhwood erupts from the guano- and moss-covered floor, the tallest and oldest standing over 40 feet tall. Between the towering fungi lie a few toppled zurkhwoods, as well as several stumps.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters</strong>. Near the edge of the forest, feeding on a duergar carcass, is a lone carrion crawler. The deeper forest is guarded by four awakened zurkhwoods (use awakened tree statistics).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A svirfneblin druid inhabited this grove until a few months ago, when he felt threatened by the arrival of the aboleth and decided to follow the River of the Depths back down into the Underdark. Before he left, the druid cast <wc-fetch type=spell>awaken</wc-fetch> spells on seven zurkhwoods in the grove, three of which have since been felled by duergar axes and damage-dealing spells. The four that remain are indistinguishable from normal zurkhwoods while they remain motionless. The awakened zurkhwoods try to kill or drive off creatures that cause harm to the grove. They understand Gnomish but can&rsquo;t speak it.</p>
<p>The duergar, Iktarve Unsuttir, came up the river with some companions to cut down zurkhwoods and sell the woodâ€”but he didn&rsquo;t count on the grove&rsquo;s fighting back. He was killed by the awakened zurkhwoods and left behind. The duergar&rsquo;s scale mail is not salvageable.</p>
<p>The carrion crawler plans to spend the next several hours quietly devouring its meal. It attacks creatures that come within 10 feet of the dead duergar, but otherwise the crawler just wants to be left alone.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Illuun the aboleth can sense the characters' presence and creates a magical projection of itself to interact with them. The projection lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the projection is intangible, it looks, sounds, and moves like the aboleth.</p>
<p>Illuun can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the projection&rsquo;s position as if the aboleth were present at that location. If the projection takes any damage, it disappears. The aboleth has had unpleasant dealings with adventurers in the past and maintains a healthy fear of them. It uses the projection to warn characters that it will not tolerate incursions into its domain and urges them to withdraw or face extermination. It suggests the characters take the south passage to the river, then follow the current down to Wyllowwood (level 5). It&rsquo;s happy to let them descend to lower levels of Undermountain, for it plans to conquer those levels eventually itself.</p>
<p>If the characters seem adamant about pressing deeper into the aboleth&rsquo;s lair, Illuun telepathically commands the eighteen Troglodyte in <strong>area area 24</strong> to circle around behind the characters (using the passage that enters <strong>area area 15</strong> from the south) while it keeps the characters engaged in conversation. At the same time, it calls the three Chuul from <strong>area area 16</strong> to come at the characters from the west, trapping them in the tunnel. As soon as the chuuls and the troglodytes arrive and begin their attack, the aboleth projection disappears.</p>

<p><strong>Petrified Otyugh</strong>. In the middle of the island, wearing a crude net as a cloak, is a <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> otyugh that the kuo-toa adopted as a god and named Bulba-Slopp. Treasure has been piled around the statue&rsquo;s three stumpy legs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the kuo-toa arrived, this island was inhabited by an otyugh. Halaster turned it to stone and lured kuo-toa to the grotto, knowing that the insane fish folk would come to worship the <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> otyugh as a god. The kuo-toa named it Bulba-Slopp, and it served as their god until the aboleth came on the scene. After Bulba-Slopp failed to protect the kuo-toa, the archpriest Noolgaloop set out to craft a new god, and Bulba-Slopp was worshiped no more.</p>

<p>The presence of the aboleth has tainted the underground river and <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> its fish. Lacking an alternative food source, the kuo-toa have been eating the fish out of necessity, which has <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> them. In their condition, the kuo-toa fight only in self-defense.</p>
<p>If the characters approach the kuo-toa in a friendly manner and offer them food or relief, the kuo-toa whips lead them to the archpriest Noolgaloop in <strong>area area 21a</strong>.</p>

Making a God</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Kuo-toa</strong>. Noolgaloop, a kuo-toa archpriest, is building a statue in the middle of this 30-foot-high cave while two Kuo-toa Whip stand perplexed.</p>
<p><strong>Rotting Corpses</strong>. Mutilated monster carcasses piled around the room&rsquo;s perimeter exude a putrid stench.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Noolgaloop is unwaveringly committed to reclaiming its holy shrine (<strong>area area 16</strong>), when the wiser course of action would be to lead its fellow kuo-toa to a new home far away from the aboleth and its servants. If the characters try to speak with the archpriest in a language other than Undercommon, Noolgaloop casts the <wc-fetch type=spell>tongues</wc-fetch> spell so they can converse. It demands that the characters help it complete the statue by retrieving the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>The legs and fur of a giant spider, to be fashioned into wings</li>
<li>Enough wood to build a chariot (a large raft or a zurkhwood mushroom would suffice)</li>
<li>A weapon worthy of a kuo-toa god</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters refuse to help, the archpriest deems them agents of the aboleth and tries to kill them with the help of its bodyguards and the kuo-toa in <strong>area area 21b</strong>. If the characters gather what it needs to complete the statue, Noolgaloop thanks them but decides on a whim to replace the statue&rsquo;s current head (a rusty lantern) with the head of one of the characters. Noolgaloop fully expects the character to make this sacrifice for the good of the kuo-toa tribe.</p>

A pair of rusty shortsword blades thrust outward from the statue&rsquo;s breast, and it wears a kilt of green moss.

<p><strong>Cave Features</strong>. This cavern has an uneven floor and ceiling, the distance between them varying from 30 to 50 feet. The damp walls are lined with natural shelves and beautiful rock draperies formed by water seepage.</p>

<p><strong>Noise</strong>. Eerie clicking sounds betray the presence of seven Hook Horror.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opportunistic hook horrors try to hook stray kuo-toa, troglodytes, or adventurers and drag them away to be devoured. Experience has taught them to avoid contact with large, well-armed groups. A party of adventurers moving through the cavern with light sources is enough to keep the hook horrors at bay, as they click and chirp eerily to one another from the shadows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the aboleth enslaves the hook horrors or drives them off. The hook horrors have yet to encounter the aboleth and thus don&rsquo;t realize the danger it represents.</p>

<p>Eighteen troglodytes live in these caves and respond quickly to sounds of battle. These enslaved troglodytes can&rsquo;t take reactions. When an enslaved troglodyte takes damage, it can make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to break free of the aboleth&rsquo;s control.

<p>The death of the aboleth allows the surviving kuo-toa to reclaim their grotto (<strong>area area 16</strong>). The kuo-toa victory is short-lived, however, because the drow start attacking them soon afterward. These attacks continue until the kuo-toa are wiped out or forced to retreat upriver. After taking over the grotto, the drow enslave the troglodytes and use them to farm <strong>area areas 3</strong> and <strong>area 5</strong>. Meanwhile, the drow move the grotto&rsquo;s treasures to a more secure location, such as the House Auvryndar stronghold on level 10.</p>
<p>If the aboleth survives, it enslaves or kills off the remaining kuo-toa in the coming weeks. The aboleth also enslaves the ettin in <strong>area area 2</strong>, and its slime poisons and kills off the fungi throughout the Twisted Caverns, destroying the delicate ecosystem. The drow challenge the victorious aboleth but are unable to defeat it on their own, given the limited support they receive from House Auvryndar. Several quaggoths that were once loyal to the drow become the aboleth&rsquo;s thralls. The resulting stalemate makes the drow desperate for aid, regardless of the source.</p>
