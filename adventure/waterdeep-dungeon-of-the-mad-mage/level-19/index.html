<p>Named for the primordial ooze that flows through its naturally formed tunnels and chambers, this cavernous level of Undermountain is designed for four 15th-level characters. Those who overcome its challenges should reach 16th level. Whimsical even by Undermountain&rsquo;s standards, the Caverns of Ooze offer DMs the rare opportunity to sing, should they wish to portray the genies on this level in the vein of characters from an animated feature film.</p>

The Mad Mage also captured a spelljamming vessel and deposited it here, along with its crew. Finally, the demented followers of an evil god of oozes and slimes make their home here.</p>

The genies compete with one another. Whichever one obtains the lich&rsquo;s phylactery wins its freedom, damning the other to spend the remainder of its existence in Undermountain. By the rules of Halaster&rsquo;s game, the genies can use adventurers to get the job done, but they can&rsquo;t cause bodily harm to one another, either directly or indirectly. A disgruntled mud mephit named Urm has been forced to act as the genies' go-between.</p>

The ship&rsquo;s mind flayer captain (see &ldquo;<strong>area Captain N&rsquo;ghathrod</strong>") was forced to eat the brains of several shipmates to survive. The remainder of the crew fled into the caverns and have taken refuge in the ooze-filled caverns around the ship. Now the illithid waits for new humanoid brains to deliver themselves into its waiting tentacles.</p>

Halaster rewards these mad zealots by transforming them into oozes that retain most of their memories and intelligence. These servants of Ghaunadaur believe the god himself has blessed them. The Mad Mage does nothing to discourage this impression.</p>
<p>Followers of Ghaunadaur whom Halaster lures to Undermountain invariably visit a floating orb that weeps primordial ooze in <strong>area area 4</strong>. The orb is thought to be part of Ghaunadaur himself. His worshipers sometimes refer to the object as the Weeping Eye. In truth, Halaster found the oozing orb and brought it here solely to flood the caverns and mislead Ghaunadaur&rsquo;s vile devotees.</p>

Shipwreck</h4><p>This 50-foot-high cavern contains the wreck of a cog (a 54-foot-long cargo vessel with a single mast). The wreck&rsquo;s features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hull</strong>. The ship has broken in half, the shattered bow aiming northward and the aft section leaning against the east wall. The oak hull is soft and waterlogged, as though the vessel has been underwater for years, and both halves are encrusted with barnacles.</p>
<p><strong>Mast and Anchor</strong>. The mast and anchor have broken off and lie in the middle of the cave, with the mast pointing toward a shimmering curtain of water to the west.</p>
<p><strong>No Sails, No Rigging, No Crew</strong>. The ship&rsquo;s square sail, rigging, and crew are all missing. (The sail and the rigging disintegrated long ago.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who search the wreck discover its name carved over the barnacle-encrusted rudder: the <em>Blue Opal</em>. A character who learns the ship&rsquo;s name and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check recalls that the <em>Blue Opal</em> sank in Waterdeep&rsquo;s harbor a few years ago under mysterious circumstances, and that the crew was rescued by merfolk who live in the harbor. Armed with this knowledge, a character can examine the hull for signs of foul play and, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check, discover a square, smooth-cut hole in the aft section below what would have been the water line. A successful DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check confirms that a <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch> spell made the square hole, but there&rsquo;s no way to know who cast the spell or why the ship was sunk.</p>
<p>If more than one character enters the aft section at the same time, the partial hull shifts under the added weight, topples to one side, and collapses in on itself with a thunderous racket. Any creature inside the aft section when it collapses must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage from falling debris on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The watery curtains in <strong>area area 1b</strong> prevent the sound of the collapse from reaching <strong>area area 1c</strong>.</p>

<a href=#1b-curtains-of-water class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>1b. Curtains of Water</h4><p>This passage has a 20-foot-high, arched ceiling and contains three 1-foot-thick, magic curtains of translucent, shimmering green seawater. Each watery curtain stretches from floor to ceiling and wall to wall. Sound passing through a curtain is greatly reduced; only creatures within 5 feet of it can hear anything from the other side.</p>
<p>Any object thrown or shot through a watery curtain has a cost of 60 feet immediately applied to its distance traveled. If this added distance changes a ranged weapon attack from normal to long range, the attack roll is made with disadvantage. An object that enters the curtain and can travel no farther falls to the floor inside the curtain.</p>
<p>Spell effects that would not reasonably pass through the watery curtain are stopped by the barrier as though it were a solid wall. For example, a <wc-fetch type=spell>magic missile</wc-fetch> spell could pass through the curtain to hit creatures on the far side of it, but the explosion from a <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> spell would not get through the barrier.</p>
<p>A creature that passes through a watery curtain gets drenched but suffers no other ill effects. In addition, lit torches and other open flames of a nonmagical nature are doused as they pass through the water. Any creature that takes damage from water, such as a fire elemental, takes 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) cold damage when it starts its turn in a watery curtain or enters it for the first time on a turn.</p>
<p>If a watery curtain takes 50 cold damage or more from a single source, it becomes a 1-foot-thick wall of ice (as if created by a <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of ice</wc-fetch> spell) for 10 minutes before reverting to its original form. A watery curtain targeted by a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 17) is destroyed for good.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The marid, Ichthyglug, is swimming in his pool when the characters first arrive. He greets them with a song (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Ichthyglug&rsquo;s Song</strong>&rdquo; sidebar). As he sings, Ichthyglug uses his magic to cause fountains of water to erupt from the pool as quippers leap out of the water around him. Ichthyglug is neither good nor evil, but always unpredictable. His attitude toward the characters reflects their attitude toward him.</p>
<p>After concluding his song, Ichthyglug floats up to characters who seem receptive and gives them the opportunity to flatter his singing. After these pleasantries, he offers the characters a quest: destroy the lich Ezzat on level 20 and give the lich&rsquo;s phylactery to Ichthyglug. The marid promises fabulous treasure in exchange, even going so far as to mention that he is forced by Halaster&rsquo;s magic to make good on this promise (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>If the characters complete Ichthyglug&rsquo;s quest and give Ezzat&rsquo;s phylactery to the marid, the pool in this cavern turns into a vortex that draws Ichthyglug, the water, the quippers, and the lich&rsquo;s phylactery back to the Elemental Plane of Water. The characters find Ichthyglug&rsquo;s promised reward at the bottom of the drained pool. Characters who complete Ichthyglug&rsquo;s quest should receive XP as if they had defeated the marid and the swarms of quippers in combat.</p>
<p>If the characters destroy Ezzat but give the lich&rsquo;s phylactery to JarÃ»k the dao in <strong>area area 11b</strong>, Ichthyglug knows this. Furious, he attacks the characters the next time he sees them.</p>
<p>Ichthyglug can&rsquo;t leave his cave without Ezzat&rsquo;s phylactery. If the marid dies here, his body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, only to re-form 24 hours later. (The characters don&rsquo;t receive XP for killing Ichthyglug more than once.)</p>
<p>The marid commands the quippers to attack anyone who dares to enter his pool. The swarms pose no danger to creatures on land.</p>

These baubles vanish with the marid when he returns to the Elemental Plane of Water.</p>
<p>Ichthyglug&rsquo;s reward consists of a suit of <wc-fetch type=item>mariner&rsquo;s armor</wc-fetch> (scale mail) and two common wondrous items: a <wc-fetch type=item>candle of the deep</wc-fetch> and a <wc-fetch type=item>pole of angling</wc-fetch> (both described below). These items appear only after the characters complete Ichthyglug&rsquo;s quest and help the marid escape from Undermountain.</p>
<p>The flame of the <wc-fetch type=item>candle of the deep</wc-fetch> is not extinguished when immersed in water. It gives off light and heat like a normal candle.</p>
<p>The <wc-fetch type=item>pole of angling</wc-fetch> looks like a 10-foot pole. While holding the pole, one can speak the command word (&ldquo;Ichthyglug&rdquo;) and transform it into a fishing pole with a hook, a line, and a reel. Speaking the command word again changes the fishing pole back into a normal 10-foot pole.</p>

When the characters first arrive, the ooze rises and takes the form of a conga line of modrons stretching as far as the characters can see. The modrons march against the sluggish flow and make little progress. After 1 minute, they sink back into the ooze. The ooze modrons aren&rsquo;t creatures or spell effects, and they can&rsquo;t be harmed or dispelled.</p>

Ooze Halaster</h4><p>An artery of ooze flows down this tunnel and pools in a slight depression in the rocky floor. The first time anyone comes within 10 feet of the pool, the ooze rises up, takes the form of Halaster Blackcloak, and flails its arms in a way that suggests it might be trying to cast a spell. After 1 minute, the effigy of Halaster loses its form and becomes a pool of ooze once more. The ooze isn&rsquo;t a creature and can&rsquo;t be harmed, nor is it a magical effect that can be dispelled.</p>

The Weeping Eye</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Ooze</strong>. This 60-foot-high cavern contains a large pool of viscid, foul-smelling ooze that flows sluggishly northwest.</p>
<p><strong>Urm</strong>. A mud mephit named Urm crouches near the edge of the ooze (at the spot marked M on map 19), absently poking it with a short pole while mumbling to itself.</p>
<p><strong>Orb</strong>. Near the east wall, a 10-foot-diameter orb of ooze floats 5 feet above the pool. The orb weeps a continuous stream of ooze into the pool and appears to be its source (see &ldquo;<strong>area Orb of Ooze</strong>&rdquo; below).</p>
<p><strong>Rock Formations</strong>. The cavern&rsquo;s ceiling is dotted with stalactites, and the ooze flows around a few stalagmites that rise from the rocky floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Urm had the misfortune of being caught up in the ooze being siphoned from the Swamp of Oblivion and deposited here. Halaster found the mud mephit and cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>geas</wc-fetch> spell on it, compelling it to serve JarÃ»k the dao and Ichthyglug the marid. The genies use Urm as an intermediary to communicate insults to one another, but the mephit has grown weary of the genies' game. It wants to be free of Halaster&rsquo;s <em>geas</em> spell.</p>
<p>Urm knows all about the competition between JarÃ»k and Ichthyglug, and tries to lead adventurers to both genies, one after the other. Urm offers to take characters to see Ichthyglug first (<strong>area area 1</strong>), since the marid is closer. If the characters have already spoken with Ichthyglug, Urm offers to guide them to JarÃ»k&rsquo;s caverns (<strong>area area 11</strong>) by following the river of ooze.</p>
<p>Urm is lazy and selfish, inclined not to help characters beyond what it must do to satisfy the terms of its <wc-fetch type=spell>geas</wc-fetch> spell. It is familiar with the dangers lurking in the Caverns of Ooze but denies knowing anything. Removing Halaster&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>geas</wc-fetch> spell makes the mephit somewhat more helpful but doesn&rsquo;t change its wicked disposition. In exchange for its newfound freedom, Urm shares the following information, which is a mixture of truth and lies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ooze that spills from the orb and fills these caverns comes from a place called the Swamp of Oblivion (true).</li>
<li>Halaster captured a strange-looking vessel and hid it in a giant cavern nearby (true). The ship is alive (false).</li>
<li>A powerful demon is trapped in a statue to the north (false).</li>

The puddings cast <wc-fetch type=spell>Melf&rsquo;s acid arrow</wc-fetch> spells at prey beyond their reach.</p>

Standing Gate to Level 12</h4><p>At the north end of this 20-foot-high cave are two 15-foot-tall standing stones hewn from black basalt. Carved into the lintel spanning them is a large, blood-red X. The standing stones form one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>").</p>
<p>When a creature comes within 5 feet of the gate, rivulets of blood begin to seep from the rocky pores of the standing stones. The rules of this gate are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature marked with a bloody X stands within 5 feet of it.</li>
<li>Characters must be 12th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 8b on level 12</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>

<p>Halaster killed a beholder that sought to carve out a domain on this level. From its moldering corpse grew a host of gas spores.

<p>The dao, JarÃ»k, rises out of the sand when the characters first arrive. He greets them with a song (see the &ldquo;JarÃ»k&rsquo;s Song&rdquo; sidebar). As he sings, the veiled medusas emerge from their alcove and begin to dance around him as the sand swirls and forms little dust devils. JarÃ»k is evil and cruel, but his current predicament motivates him to be a civil host.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Once his song has ended, JarÃ»k offers the characters a quest: destroy the lich Ezzat on level 20 and bring him the lich&rsquo;s phylactery. The dao promises treasure in exchange and is forced by Halaster&rsquo;s magic to make good on this promise (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). If the characters complete JarÃ»k&rsquo;s quest and give Ezzat&rsquo;s phylactery to the dao, the sandy floor turns into a giant vortex that draws JarÃ»k, the medusas, the sand, and the lich&rsquo;s phylactery back to the Elemental Plane of Earth. The characters find JarÃ»k&rsquo;s promised reward on the floor of the emptied cave. Characters who complete JarÃ»k&rsquo;s quest should receive XP as if they had defeated the dao and the medusas in combat.</p>
<p>If the characters destroy Ezzat but give the lich&rsquo;s phylactery to Ichthyglug the marid in <strong>area area 1c</strong>, JarÃ»k knows this and attacks the characters the next time he sees them.</p>
<p>JarÃ»k can&rsquo;t leave his cave without Ezzat&rsquo;s phylactery. If the dao dies here, his body disintegrates into crystalline powder, only to re-form 24 hours later. (The characters don&rsquo;t receive XP for killing JarÃ»k more than once.)</p>

Ghaunadaur Shrine</h3><p><strong>Intelligent Oozes</strong>. Clinging to the 20-foot-high ceiling are three intelligent black puddings that were once drow worshipers of Ghaunadaur (see &ldquo;<strong>area Intelligent Black Puddings</strong>"). These oozes are hostile toward all intruders. (A battle here also attracts the Huge gray ooze in <strong>area area 14</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Shrine</strong>. Nestled in a 12-foot-high alcove at the back of the cave is a misshapen granite altar. Staring out from it is a 1-foot-diameter purple disk inscribed with a black, glaring eye. Looming behind the altar is a 9-foot-tall statue carved in the form of an amorphous, forward-lurching pillar that reaches out with a dozen clawed human arms.</p>
<p>The disk embedded in the altar can be removed by turning it 360 degrees counterclockwise. Removing the disk causes copper coins to spill out from a hollow cavity inside the altar (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>If the altar is opened, the multiarmed representation of Ghaunadaur animates and attacks creatures within 10 feet of it or within 5 feet of the altar. The statue is a Large object with AC 17, 50 hit points, a speed of 0 feet, and immunity to acid, poison, and psychic damage. It has the following ability scores: Strength 14, Dexterity 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. It has <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 10 feet and is blind beyond this radius.</p>
<p>As an action, the animated statue makes a single melee weapon attack (+10 to hit) with its claws. On a hit, the claws deal 22 (<wc-roll>5d6 + 5</wc-roll>) slashing damage to the target, and any nonmagical armor worn by the target is destroyed.</p>

The Scavenger</h3><p>The <em>Scavenger</em> is a 290-foot-long, 50-foot-wide, 25-ton spelljamming vesselâ€”a ship designed to travel through space. Halaster detected the vessel as it orbited Toril and lured it through a magic gate into Undermountain. He then boarded the vessel, stole its spelljamming helm (the magic device that propels and steers the craft), and took the helm to level 23, leaving the captain and crew to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>Mind flayers constructed the <em>Scavenger</em> to resemble a giant cuttlefish. Its hull is made of an alien resin as hard as thick wood. Behind the ship&rsquo;s tentacle-shaped rams are two circular windows of transparent crystal resembling eyes, and an upper deck (<strong>area area 13a</strong>) equipped with four ballistae manned by gray slaadi. An open hatch on the upper deck provides access to the lower deck (<strong>area areas 13b</strong> through <strong>area 13h</strong>). The ceilings on the lower deck are 10 feet high.</p>
<p>The ship sits in a 5-foot-deep pool of ooze in an immense cavern, the ceiling of which varies from 30 to 50 feet high. A character can climb the ship&rsquo;s hull with a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check; the distance from the cavern floor to the upper deck is roughly 20 feet.</p>
<p>The <em>Scavenger</em> is buoyant but has no sails, oars, or other means of propulsion without its spelljamming helm. The vessel can hold up to 10 tons of cargo, and its standard crew complement is twenty. It has AC 15, 400 hit points, a damage threshold of 20, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>
<p>Only a carefully worded <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell can free the <em>Scavenger</em> from the cavernous depths of Undermountain. Characters who free the ship from its confines can sell it for 20,000 gp, minus 50 gp for each point of damage the ship has taken.</p>

N&rsquo;ghathrod is a mind flayer arcanist (see the sidebar in the &ldquo;Mind Flayer&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual) with 111 hit points. It uses a crystal orb as an arcane focus and dresses in pirate garb. A wooden peg replaces one of its feet, which it lost in battle years ago. Tucked in the pockets of its overcoat are four fist-sized gray gemstonesâ€”the control gems for the gray slaadi that guard the ship&rsquo;s upper deck. N&rsquo;ghathrod carries a rapier as an affectation but it not proficient with the weapon.</p>
<p>Before it turned to a life of space piracy, N&rsquo;ghathrod lived in a mind flayer colony on the ringed planet of Glyth, which is farther from the sun than Toril. A few weeks after the <em>Scavenger</em> became trapped in Undermountain, N&rsquo;ghathrod turned on its orog crew out of hunger, killing four of them and eating their brains. The remaining orog crew members fled to avoid a similar fate. The arrival of adventurers provides N&rsquo;ghathrod with an unexpected but welcome food source. It tries to separate one party member from the others with a wall of force spell. It then uses its Mind Blast to stun its prey as a prelude to extracting its brain.</p>
<p>If N&rsquo;ghathrod is reduced to 55 hit points or fewer, its survival instinct supersedes its hunger, prompting it to surrender telepathically. The mind flayer apologizes for its assault and proposes an end to hostilities. Given a chance, it recounts how the <em>Scavenger</em> was orbiting Toril when it was pulled through a magic gate to its current location. It also reveals that the ship&rsquo;s spelljamming helm vanished shortly thereafter (spirited away by a wish spell, though the mind flayer doesn&rsquo;t know it). If the mind flayer and the characters establish a truce, N&rsquo;ghathrod offers to &ldquo;guard the ship&rdquo; while the characters set out to retrieve the stolen helm. If the characters succeed, N&rsquo;ghathrod allows them to claim the vessel as their own, accepting a demotion until it finds a way to get rid of them.</p>
<p><strong>Lair Actions:</strong> When fighting aboard the Scavenger, N&rsquo;ghathrod can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), N&rsquo;ghathrod can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
<p>,- N&rsquo;ghathrod creates a magical duplicate of itself anywhere aboard the ship. Formed out of psionic energy, this duplicate lasts until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until it is dispelled (DC 15), or until N&rsquo;ghathrod takes another lair action. The duplicate has the statistics of a normal mind flayer and is friendly toward N&rsquo;ghathrod, but not under its control. It cannot leave the Scavenger.,- N&rsquo;ghathrod fills all interior areas of the ship with mind-warping images and sounds of the Far Realm that last until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature that isn&rsquo;t an aberration that starts its turn inside the ship must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) psychic damage.</p>

<p><strong>Hatch</strong>. Not visible from the floor of the cavern is an open hatch with a ladder that descends to <strong>area area 13b</strong>.</p>
<p>A ballista is a Large object with AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Before it can be fired, a ballista must be loaded and aimed. (The ballistae are loaded when the characters first arrive.) It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it (+6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target). On a hit, a ballista bolt deals 16 (<wc-roll>3d10</wc-roll>) piercing damage.</p>
<p>Each ballista comes with ten bolts stored in a rack built into the weapon&rsquo;s stand. A swivel base gives each ballista a firing arc of 180 degrees.</p>
<p>The slaadi have been trained to load, aim, and fire the ballistae. They defend the deck against all boarders, relying on their <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> to keep watch.</p>

<p><strong>Dead Cook</strong>. The hallway leading toward the lower deck&rsquo;s forward sections contains a third dead orog, this one wearing a bloodstained apron and no armor.</p>

<p>The dead orog on the ladder hangs by one of its spiked boots. A character can use an action to dislodge the dangling fellow. Examination of all three orogs reveals that their skulls were cracked open and their brains sucked outâ€”the hallmark of a mind flayer attack.

The chests are unlocked, their locks broken off.</p>
<p>Chest 1 contains 400 sp, 180 gp, and three gold bracelets (25 gp each). Half buried by coins is a 5-inch-diameter miniature beholder made of enameled gold with a black pearl central eye and multicolored spinels at the ends of its eyestalks (2,500 gp).</p>
<p>Chest 2 contains six bolts of elven silk (50 gp each) and an engraved box containing five 3-inch-tall figurinesâ€”each one depicting a kind of metallic dragon and made of the appropriate metal (250 gp for the set).</p>
<p>Chest 3 contains six <wc-fetch type=item>vial of stardust</wc-fetch> that radiate an aura of illusion magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell. An <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals that the dust has a singular magical property. Any creature that sprinkles the dust over itself gains the ability to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>dream</wc-fetch> spell once as an action (spell save DC 15), requiring no components.</p>
<p>Chest 4 contains 320 gp and a silk pouch holding four blue pellets, each of which reproduces the magical property of a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of healing</wc-fetch> when swallowed.</p>
<p>Chest 5 contains a matching set of five copper goblets with silver filigree (25 gp each), a black coral necklace (250 gp), and a mummified elven hand wearing two gem-studded gold rings (250 gp each).</p>
<p>Crates 1 through 3 contain <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> rations. A character who inspects these rations and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check can tell that they&rsquo;re unfit to eat. Any creature that ingests a helping of <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> rations must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Crate 4 contains 60 days of edible dry rations.</p>
<p>Crate 5 is stamped with the symbol of a smiling gnome face encircled with the words &ldquo;KRICKENHOF&rsquo;S KRAFTWERKS&rdquo; in carnival letters. Packed in peanuts are three gnome inventions: a spring-loaded pogo stick (25 gp), a wind-up tomato masher (125 gp), and a strap-on helmet with a wooden propeller mounted to the top of it. This <wc-fetch type=item>propeller helm</wc-fetch> is an uncommon wondrous item to which only a Small humanoid can attune. While worn, the helm allows its wearer to use an action to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>levitate</wc-fetch> spell, requiring no components. The helm&rsquo;s propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a 50 percent chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.</p>

Although it has no memories of its former life, the mind flayer retains its elven fondness for celestial beauty. The paintings, which illustrate worlds that N&rsquo;ghathrod has visited, are worth 100 gp each.</p>
<p>N&rsquo;ghathrod&rsquo;s spellbook is bound in leather, its contents written in a Braille-like script. The mind flayer uses its tentacles to read the script, which other creatures can decipher with a <wc-fetch type=spell>comprehend languages</wc-fetch> spell. The book contains all the spells N&rsquo;ghathrod has prepared, plus <wc-fetch type=spell>animate dead</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>Bigby&rsquo;s hand</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=spell>Evard&rsquo;s black tentacles</wc-fetch>.</p>

Bridge</h4><p>The door to the bridge stands slightly ajar. N&rsquo;ghathrod, the mind flayer captain, is here (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Captain N&rsquo;ghathrod</strong>&rdquo; sidebar). The features of the bridge are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Windows</strong>. Two circular, 9-foot-diameter windows of bulging, transparent crystal rest in bronze fixtures.</p>
<p><strong>Celestial Chart</strong>. Painted on the sloped ceiling are familiar constellations and unfamiliar planets.</p>
<p><strong>Grooves</strong>. Grooves in the middle of the floor suggest that a piece of furniture once rested there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who examine the grooves and succeed on an Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain that they&rsquo;re designed to secure a heavy chair or chair-shaped object to the floor. The grooves conform to the footprint of the ship&rsquo;s spelljamming helm, which can be found on level 23.</p>
<p>The chart on the ceiling has the sun at its center, with elongated rings showing the paths of the eight planets that orbit it: rocky Anadia; Coliar the gas giant; Toril and the small asteroid cluster orbiting it called the Tears of SelÃ»ne; the water worlds Karpri and Chandos; the noxious ringed planet Glyth; the asteroid cluster of Garden, which is held together by an enormous plant; and the wheel-shaped H&rsquo;catha. Beyond the planets are the constellations of Realmspace, all visible in the night skies of Toril at various times of the year.</p>

Standing Gate to Level 17</h3><p>Rising out of a 2-foot-deep pool of ooze is a pair of 15-foot-tall standing stones topped with a lintel, carved into which is a symbol of an arrow. The standing stones form a magic gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). Its rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an arrow or a crossbow bolt is shot between the standing stones, the gate opens for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Characters must be 14th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 8b on level 17</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>

<ul>
<li>If they acquire the phylactery of the lich Ezzat, the characters must come back to the Caverns of Ooze with the phylactery to claim their prizes from the marid in <strong>area area 1c</strong> or the dao in <strong>area area 11b</strong>. Giving the phylactery to one genie makes an enemy of the other.</li>
<li>If the characters recover the spelljamming helm that was stolen by Halaster, they can return it to the <em>Scavenger</em> and use a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell to expel the vessel from Undermountain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The level changes little in the characters' absence, at least in the short term. If Ichthyglug or JarÃ»k is set free, Halaster might trap an efreeti on this level and pit it against whichever genie was denied Ezzat&rsquo;s phylactery, setting up the new arrival in a cave befitting its fiery nature.</p>
