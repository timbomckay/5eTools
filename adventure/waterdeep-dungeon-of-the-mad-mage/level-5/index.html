<p>Wyllowwood is designed for four 8th-level characters. Those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 9th level. In some cases, defeating a monster can be accomplished without slaying it. If the characters strike a truce with a creature, award them XP as if they had defeated it in combat.</p>
<p>The characters will most likely arrive here by way of the River of the Depths, which they first encounter on level 4. Characters who follow the river must navigate rapids and small waterfalls to reach Wyllowwood. Beyond this level, the River of the Depths begins its lengthy, tumultuous descent into the Underdarkâ€”a voyage no ordinary boat or raft can survive.</p>

These temperate forests were magically created by Halaster, and the sky high above can fool adventurers into thinking they have escaped Undermountain and found their way back to the surface. Birds, insects, and tree-dwelling mammals live here alongside Wyllowwood&rsquo;s fiercer denizens.</p>
<p>The forests are real and nourished by magic, and Halaster regularly repopulates them with birds, insects, rodents, and larger mammals. The main caverns have 100-foot-high ceilings hidden by illusions that can&rsquo;t be dispelled. These illusions begin 30 feet above ground and create the impression of open sky where high walls and ceilings should be. The illusions flawlessly duplicate the sun, the moon, the stars, and clouds, though there is no wind or breeze to speak of. During the day, the warmth of the sun can be felt, and at night the temperature drops as one would expect. Despite appearances, the walls and ceilings are still very much in place, and a <wc-fetch type=spell>true seeing</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals them.</p>
<p>A magic calendar stone in <strong>area area 6k</strong> allows one to change the time of day, the weather, and the season in Wyllowwood&rsquo;s forests. Wyllow the archdruid (see &ldquo;What Dwells Here?&rdquo; below) is the only one permitted to use the calendar stone. When the characters first arrive, Wyllowwood is enjoying a warm autumnâ€”Wyllow&rsquo;s favorite season.</p>

Her neighbors include a green dragon suffering from an identity crisis and a village of goblin werebats.</p>
<h3 id=wyllow>
<a href=#wyllow class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Wyllow</h3><p>Wyllow is a moon elf druid with eyes as green as emeralds. Butterflies nest in her tangled black hair, and small critters gather around her feet.</p>
<p>Over two hundred years ago, Wyllow fell in love with Yinark, a wizard in league with Halaster, and returned with him to Undermountain. Her happiness faded quickly when the dungeon proved to be a far cry from the woods she called home. Determined to keep Wyllow in Undermountain, Halaster used several <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spells to create a magical forest for her, but even this gift wasn&rsquo;t enough to offset the druid&rsquo;s languor. When Yinark forbade her from ever returning to the surface, Wyllow grew positively despondent. The relationship soured and turned violent. A volley of spells on both sides resulted in Yinark&rsquo;s death. After Wyllow&rsquo;s fury abated, all that remained was undying grief and encroaching madness. She remains in Undermountain in accordance with Yinark&rsquo;s wishes, a prisoner of her own guilt.</p>
<p>Undermountain is Wyllow&rsquo;s home now, and all memory of the surface world has faded from her mind. She is distant but kind toward those who pass harmlessly through her domain, but turns violent whenever her forest or its peaceful denizens are threatened. Before setting out to destroy interlopers, she rallies the green dragon and the werebats, using them to soften up her adversaries. She can also summon six awakened trees from the forest with a whistle.</p>
<p>Wyllow&rsquo;s displacer beast companion, Crissann, is named after a human mercenary whom the elf befriended many years ago. Before this friendship could blossom into a romance, Halaster intervened and used his magic to turn Wyllow&rsquo;s new friend against her. The heartbroken druid slew Crissann in the woods with the help of several forest creatures and vowed never to let another mortal touch her heart so deeply.</p>
<p>Wyllow has conflicted feelings about Halaster. She is grateful to him for providing her a home and keeping Wyllowwood alive with his magic, but she blames him for Yinark&rsquo;s death. She also pities him, for the Mad Mage too appears to be trapped in a prison of his own making. Wyllow believes he is no longer human, but an immortal entity composed of pure magic. Thus, she has given up any hope of being rid of him.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wyllow is chaotic neutral.</li>
<li>She has these racial traits: Her walking speed is 35 feet. She has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet. She has advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>, and magic can&rsquo;t put her to sleep. She speaks Common, Druidic, and Elvish.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=valdemar-tearulai>

The dragon now refers to itself as Tearulai and has the longsword&rsquo;s neutral good alignment. It sleeps atop a platform overlooking the River of the Depths, guarding its treasure.</p>
<p>Wyllow once set adventurers against Valdemar, hoping to destroy the evil dragon, but the dragon&rsquo;s change of alignment caused Wyllow to reconsider their relationship. Now that Valdemar and Tearulai are one, the archdruid considers the dragon part of Wyllowwood&rsquo;s ecosystem. The two currently enjoy a peaceful coexistence.</p>
<h3 id=goblin-werebats>

Wyllow allowed these evil humans to hunt in her forest, but they abused the privilegeâ€”so the archdruid and her green dragon ally eradicated the cultists.</p>
<p>The village and its environs stood empty for years until a congregation of goblin werebats took residence in the caves around the buildings. The werebats prefer the dank caves to the structures, which have largely remained abandoned. Wyllow allows the werebats to feed on stray vermin and adventurers. They wisely acknowledge the archdruid as master of the forest and leave her animals and her dragon ally alone.</p>

The woods support awakened shrubs, awakened trees, bats, bears, blink dogs, boars, deer, elk, rodents, small birds, and other denizens of temperate forests. Carrion crawlers, ettercaps, giant spiders, and owlbears make occasional forays into the woods as well.</p>

If they feed the bear, it follows them like a companion and expects to be fed regularly.</p>
<h4 id=tree-believers>

If the characters are looking for shelter, safe passage to deeper levels of Undermountain, or information, the trees offer to escort them to Wyllow&rsquo;s tower(<strong>area area 6</strong>).</p>

To appease the archdruid, the other werebats drove Vool out of their village. He found a secluded cave nearby (see <strong>area area 17</strong>) and took refuge there. He ventures out once a day to feed but avoids contact with his kin.</p>
<p>If Vool catches sight of the party, he tries to feed on a lone straggler. If captured or cornered, he apologizes for his uncontrollable blood lust and offers to make amends by serving as a faithful guide. He&rsquo;s lonely and genuinely in search of companionship, but he is without honor or decency. In an attempt to win favor and distract the characters from his own shortcomings, Vool tries to turn them against Wyllow, painting the archdruid as a creature of pure madness and malevolence. He also shares rumors of &ldquo;great treasures&rdquo; that are hidden inside Wyllow&rsquo;s tower.</p>

<p>The river&rsquo;s depth varies from a few feet to as much as 30 feet in spots. Characters who trawl the depths for treasure might find the odd bauble here and there, or possibly something more dangerous like a sleeping hydra.</p>
<p>At various points along the river are crude wooden signs, each one carved with the word &ldquo;Underdark&rdquo; in Goblin and an arrow pointing downriver.</p>

<p>Most of the trees are mature, with heights of 30 to 50 feet. Foot trails meander between them, and any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check to search for tracks can see the slender footprints of a solitary humanoidâ€”a female elfâ€”among the tracks left by various other forest inhabitants.</p>
<p>Running through the forest are crumbling, 20-foot-high walkways atop ivy-covered, white marble archways supported by thick white marble columns. Some sections of the walkways have collapsed due to age or seismic activity.</p>
<p>The characters are free to pick berries, gather fallen branches, collect acorns and pinecones, and rest on moss-covered logs. Chopping down a tree, starting a fire, killing an animal, or any similar act of destruction will not be tolerated. Wyllow has many spies in the forest, which speed to her tower to communicate the party&rsquo;s misdeeds. If so informed, she moves swiftly to eradicate the trespassers.</p>

Old Grave</h4><p>Thin rays of sunlight or moonlight penetrate the dense canopy of this old forest, whose trees are covered with moss.</p>
<p>At night, a <strong>will-o'-wisp</strong> lures adventurers to a grave in the middle of this cavern. The grave stands amid a grove of dead, burned trees. It is marked with a headstone that reads in Common, &ldquo;Here lies Crissann, human friend and companion.&rdquo; The top of the gravestone is carved in the shape of a rose. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell cast in the vicinity reveals a source of evocation magic buried in the earth (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The will-o'-wisp is Crissann&rsquo;s disembodied spirit. During the day, it hovers invisibly over the grave. With a whispery voice, it says, in Common, &ldquo;Take my wand. Use it to destroy Wyllow, the elf witch!&rdquo; If the characters obtain the wand from the grave, the will-o'-wisp tries to lead them to Wyllow&rsquo;s tower and a showdown with the archdruid. If the characters refuse to avenge Crissann, the will-o'-wisp attacks them. Otherwise, it considers the characters its allies. If Wyllow is defeated, the will-o'-wisp is overcome with despair and turns against the party, fighting until destroyed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arch</strong>. Carved into the middle of the east wall is a decorative stone arch enclosing a blank wall (see &ldquo;Arch Gate to Level 2&rdquo; below).</p>
<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. A wooden trestle table lies on its side in the middle of the room. An iron chandelier with melted wax candles is suspended from a rafter above it by a rope tied off to a hook near the northern door.</p>
<p><strong>Dead Halfling</strong>. Tucked behind an iron stove in the northeast corner is a dead halfling in leather armor, his face twisted into a mask of horror.</p>

<p><strong>Crystal Decor</strong>. The walls of this 60-foot-high cavern are covered with naturally formed crystal draperies that resemble frozen waterfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Moaning Fissure</strong>. A 30-foot-long, 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep fissure cuts across the middle of the ceiling like an open wound. The ominous moan heard throughout the complex originates from here and is made by a cloaker hiding in the crack.</p>
<p><strong>Gate</strong>. An iron gate is embedded in the east wall (see <strong>area area 4a</strong> for details).</p>
<p><strong>Illusory Wall</strong>. A 20-foot-square section of wall south of <strong>area area 4d</strong> is illusory and conceals a tunnel. The illusory wall has no substance, and creatures can pass right through it. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 17) dispels the illusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cloaker is using its moan to draw others of its kind to this location, hoping to form a conclave. If the cloaker detects interlopers, it creates phantasmal duplicates of itself, emerges from the crack in the ceiling, and attacks.</p>

Inner Forest</h3><p>A thorough exploration of this part of the forest reveals several items of note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Litter</strong>. The forest is strewn with rusty weapons, burnt torch stubs, empty bottles, and other worthless paraphernalia left behind by adventurers.</p>
<p><strong>Druidic Totems</strong>. Eerie totems hang from the trees. Made from twigs, feathers, and tattered bits of cloth, they look like crude dolls. (Each one is modeled after a humanoid Wyllow has killed.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General features of the forest are summarized in the &ldquo;Forest Features&rdquo; sidebar. Characters who engage in wanton destruction are accosted by several creatures, each of which has been the recipient of an <wc-fetch type=spell>awaken</wc-fetch> spell: four Awakened Tree, an awakened brown bear, two awakened Elk, and three awakened Giant Wasp. These creatures are loyal servants of the archdruid.</p>
<h3 id=6-wyllows-tower>

Wyllow&rsquo;s Tower</h3><p>Wyllow&rsquo;s Tower is carved to look like a squat stone tree with twisted, stony boughs protruding from the walls. Thirteen Giant Bat hang from these crumbling limbs like ornaments, their wings wrapped tightly around their bodies. If the characters try to climb the tower, the bats attack. The bats otherwise fight only in self-defense or at Wyllow&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>At the base of the tower, on the south side, is a 12-foot-high arched double door made of carved stone. A rope hanging next to the door rings a bell when tugged. If the characters knock or ring before entering, Wyllow&rsquo;s usher, Halastree, greets them and leads them to <strong>area area 6a</strong>. Halastree is an awakened tree whose trunk Wyllow carved in the likeness of Halaster. It speaks Common and is exceptionally polite. If the characters enter the tower unannounced, they get as far as <strong>area area 6a</strong> before encountering someone.</p>
<p>All rooms in the tower are brightly lit by beams of magical light, which emanate from the ceiling and shine down on the dusty, tiled floor.</p>
<p>All doors in the tower are made of carved stone. All ceilings are 10 feet high, except in <strong>area area 6a</strong>.</p>

Wyllow&rsquo;s Throne Room</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Detritus</strong>. Dead leaves and twigs cover the dusty floor.</p>
<p><strong>Balcony</strong>. The room has a vaulted ceiling 20 feet high. Stone pillars carved to look like trees support a 10-foot-high stone balcony that runs along the north, east, and south walls. The trees' stone branches serve as the balcony&rsquo;s railings.</p>
<p><strong>Archdruid and Friends</strong>. Wyllow is here, attended by Crissann, her displacer beast companion, and Halastree, her awakened tree usher. Wyllow wears a gold key on a string around her neck (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). The archdruid sits meditating in a throne of yellow crystal that stands in the western alcove. The throne has eyes carved into it.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Doors</strong>. Flanking the crystal throne are two secret doors. One swings open into <strong>area area 6b</strong>, the other into <strong>area area 6c</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wyllow&rsquo;s crystal throne was carved by dwarves and given to her by her late husband, Yinark. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of divination magic around it. A creature seated on the throne has advantage on Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) checks.</p>
<p>For information on Wyllow, see the &ldquo;<strong>area Wyllow</strong>&rdquo; section at the start of the chapter. The archdruid is friendly toward visitors who have done nothing to anger her. The displacer beast and the awakened tree fight to the death to defend her.</p>
<p>Characters who do nothing to antagonize Wyllow can secure safe passage through her demesne, though she warns them to steer clear of the goblin werebats and show the green dragon the respect it&rsquo;s due. She knows the locations of Wyllowwood&rsquo;s gates and how to activate them (see <strong>area areas 3b</strong>, <strong>area 6i</strong>, and <strong>area 9</strong>), as well as the passages leading down to levels 6 and 7. If the characters slay the cloakers north of her tower (in <strong>area area 4</strong>), Wyllow will share this information with them.</p>

<p><strong>Debris</strong>. Broken staffs litter the dusty floor.</p>
<p><strong>Table</strong>. A beam of light shines down on a narrow, rectangular stone table in the middle of the room. On the table rests a wooden staff carved with floral motifs.</p>

<p>Wyllow dabbles in magic item creation. The broken staffs testify to her numerous failures. The intact staff on the table represents her only success to date.</p>

While holding the staff, a creature can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of it, or from the staff itself. Unless a specific kind of flower is chosen, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. Wyllow&rsquo;s staff is peculiar in that it can&rsquo;t create roses, which the archdruid dislikes. If a rose is chosen, a daisy grows instead. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.</p>
<p>The staff has 10 charges and regains <wc-roll>1d6 + 4</wc-roll> expended charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll>. On a 1, the staff turns into black rose petals and is lost forever.</p>

Set into the chest is a magic lock whose tumblers adjust to confound burglars. A character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, but the check is made with disadvantage. Inserting Wyllow&rsquo;s gold key (see <strong>area area 6a</strong>) into the lock also opens the chest, as does a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>The chest contains a pair of sapphire earrings (250 gp apiece), an armband made of overlapping gold leaves (250 gp), a random trinket (roll on the <wc-fetch type=item>Trinket</wc-fetch> table in chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook), and a crystal bulb as big as a pear. Inside the crystal bulb is a tiny effigy of Halaster Blackcloak. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the bulb.</p>
<p>If the crystal bulb is planted in earth or soil on this level of Undermountain, it is destroyed as Halaster Blackcloak (see appendix A) sprouts from the ground where the bulb was buried. This is the real Halaster, delivered by his own magic. The Mad Mage entrusted the bulb to Wyllow in case she needed to summon him and is annoyed if someone else uses it.</p>
<p>If the characters have done nothing aside from this to offend him, Halaster babbles about his current preoccupation (see &ldquo;<strong>area Halaster&rsquo;s Goals</strong>") and demands the characters do whatever they can to help him. He then teleports away in a huff. If the characters manage to get a word in edgewise, they might persuade him to share useful information before he leaves. He might, for example, divulge the secret to activating one of his many gates, or he might mention creatures known to dwell on one of the deeper levels of Undermountain. If the characters attack him, Halaster retaliates in kind.</p>

Arch Gate to Level 3</h4><p>Dust and cobwebs fill this room. Set into the middle of the east wall is a stone arch enclosing a blank wall. This is one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). The keystone and base stones of the arch each bear the graven image of an old man clutching a staff. The rules of this gate are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tapping the arch three times with a staff of any kind causes the gate to open for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Characters must be 7th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

Calendar Stone</h4><p>This spacious room has been swept clean of dust and cobwebs. It contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards</strong>. Four Giant Toad lurk in the far corners of the room. They leap forward and attack anyone not accompanied by Wyllow.</p>
<p><strong>Calendar Stone</strong>. Set into the floor is a 15-foot-diameter stone device engraved with a multitude of images.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The device has a circular center 9 feet in diameter, around which are two concentric rings of stone. The center stone is fixed in place. Its engravings depict birds, butterflies, fish, and small mammals encircling Wyllow&rsquo;s smiling visage. Each ring is 3 feet wide and turns clockwise on hidden rollers. The inner ring is engraved with images of plants and animals weathering the change of seasons. The outer ring bears alternating engravings of the sun at various heights and the moon in all its phases. A fixture on the outer edge of the device is used to line up the rings and indicate the present time of day and season in Wyllowwood. The rings slowly turn on their own, tracking the natural changes that occur over time. By turning a ring manually, one can force a more sudden change from day to night or night to day, or bring the effects of a new season upon Wyllowwood.</p>
<p>If the characters change the time of day or the season, all the surviving werebats except Vool (see <strong>area area 17</strong>) investigate Wyllow&rsquo;s tower in goblin form to find out what is amiss.</p>
<p>The calendar stone can&rsquo;t be damaged or dismantled.</p>

The dragon feeds mostly on blind fish and prefers to be left alone. If attacked, it lets out a roar loud enough to be heard throughout Wyllowwood. Wherever she is, Wyllow hears the roar and comes to the dragon&rsquo;s defense.</p>
<p>The dragon, Valdemar, refers to itself as Tearulai and won&rsquo;t willingly part with the sword stuck in its skull. Nor will it allow characters to enter the building or use the gate inside unless they have Wyllow&rsquo;s permission to do so. If a character tries to deceive the dragon, it can make a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check contested by the character&rsquo;s Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check to see through the deception. A character who is caught lying to the dragon can never win back its trust.</p>
<p>If the dragon is <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>, a character can use an action to try to pull Tearulai from Valdemar&rsquo;s skull, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength check. Removing the longsword in this way restores the dragon&rsquo;s evil alignment and personality. From that point on, the dragon considers Wyllow its mortal enemy.</p>

He prefers to remain in hybrid formâ€”his most fearsome aspect. In all three of his forms, Mobar&rsquo;s left eye is <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch> by a cataract, and he has a shock of white hair.</p>
<p>Mobar has the statistics of a werebat (see appendix A), with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobar has 42 hit points.</li>
<li>Due to poor depth perception, he has disadvantage on any attack roll against a target more than 30 feet away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobar is smitten by Wyllow and follows her instructions without question. He spends his idle hours making gifts for her and, in bat form, leaving them in front of her tower. The lovestruck fool is otherwise bereft of conscience, and he presides over the werebat tribe with iron-fisted resolve. As a rule, he does not treat with adventurers; he&rsquo;d rather rob them and feed on their blood.</p>
<p>If combat breaks out here, the werebats throughout <strong>area area 16</strong> investigate, converging on this location.</p>

<p>Heaped around the building are broken swords, dented helms, and torn metal armor. After the green dragon killed the cultists of Malar, Wyllow stripped the corpses of their metal gear, piled the offensive material here as a warning of sorts, and dragged the bodies to <strong>area area 7</strong> to rot.</p>

After working up the courage to explore and loot her tower, they use the calendar stone inside to trap Wyllowwood in a state of perpetual night. Over time, this has the effect of killing off the plants that need sunlight to survive.</p>
<p>In the absence of the archdruid&rsquo;s protection, the werebats and other predatory monsters raid the dying wood and kill most of the birds and mammals. If Tearulai is still lodged in Valdemar&rsquo;s skull, the dragon holds back the encroaching monsters as best it can.</p>
<p>If Tearulai and Valdemar are separated and the dragon survives, it rekindles its enmity with the archdruid and anyone else who would curtail its evil predilections. Wyllow commands newly arrived adventurers to dispose of the dragon, banishing those who refuse.</p>
