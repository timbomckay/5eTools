<p>The Dungeon Level is designed for four 5th-level characters, and characters who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 6th level.</p>

The bandits have taken over <strong>area areas 6</strong> through <strong>area 8</strong> and have spies watching <strong>area area 1</strong> to report on intruders.</p>
<p>The bandits are failed actors and singers who use disguise kits to appear as vampires. These disguises are elaborate and convincing (including wigs, theatrical clothing, makeup, fake fangs, and fake nails), but adventurers can see through the ruse with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>The leaders of the gang, Uktarl Krannoc and Harria Valashtar, were lovers once, but their relationship soured recently. They&rsquo;re fed up with each other, and each is plotting to eliminate the other and take control of the gang. Harria is the likely winner of this conflict, because she recently acquired a flesh golem that wandered up from level 2. Struck by Harria&rsquo;s resemblance to its creator, the golem has been pressed into service.</p>
<p>The Undertakers are aware that bugbears and goblins are spying on them (see &ldquo;Xanathar Guild&rdquo; below). If they encounter adventurers whom they can&rsquo;t extort or defeat, the bandits try to orchestrate a conflict between the adventurers and the goblinoids, which they hope will get rid of one or both groups.</p>

They&rsquo;re charged with keeping adventurers from reaching the lower levels and thereby interfering with guild business. With the help of several goblins, the bugbears have set up guild watch posts in <strong>area areas 23</strong>, <strong>area 28</strong>, and <strong>area 39</strong>.</p>
<p>The bugbears and their goblin toadies are plotting to kidnap one of the leaders of the Undertakers and take that person back to Skullport to have an intellect devourer implanted in their skull, so that Xanathar can take control of the bandit gang. The bugbears have been spying on the bandits and will shortly begin testing their defenses. They are <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch> by the flesh golem, though, and will offer to grant safe passage to any adventurers who promise to dispose of it. The bugbears don&rsquo;t keep their end of the bargain, but the goblins readily will do so out of self-preservation if all the bugbears and intellect devourers are dead.</p>

These creatures include carrion crawlers, ghouls, giant spiders, goblins, grells, gricks, oozes of all kinds, stirges, and wererats. If your game session needs a jolt, try using one of the following encounters or an encounter of your own design.</p>
<h4 id=carrion-crawlers>
<a href=#carrion-crawlers class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Carrion Crawlers</h4><p>Three Carrion Crawler, one creeping along the floor and two attached to the ceiling, approach the party and attack the first adventurers to come within reach of their mucus-coated tentacles. If a carrion crawler paralyzes a character with its tentacles, it continues to make bite attacks against that character on subsequent rounds as it feeds. The carrion crawlers are too stupid and hungry to flee in the face of certain death.</p>
<h4 id=goblin-skull-hunters>
<a href=#goblin-skull-hunters class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Goblin Skull-Hunters</h4><p>Pibble and Groin, two argumentative Goblin with no affiliations of note, are scouring the dungeon for intact skulls to claim as trophies. Their constant bickering can be heard up to 60 feet away, and they flee when confronted by adventurers. If one or both goblins are captured, they can lead adventurers to the nearest Xanathar Guild watch post as well as describe its defenses, since they have observed the comings and goings of the guild&rsquo;s goblinoids for some time.</p>
<h4 id=shield-guardian>
<a href=#shield-guardian class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Shield Guardian</h4><p>The Dungeon Level is home to a meandering, defective shield guardian operating under the delusion that it&rsquo;s a wizard&rsquo;s apprentice, even to the extent of pretending to cast spells. The guardian returned to this level after its wizard master perished while exploring level 4; the shield guardian&rsquo;s amulet can be found there (<strong>area level 4, area 16a</strong>). A rune on the shield guardian&rsquo;s head matches a rune inscribed on the back of its amulet.</p>
<p>When the shield guardian sees the characters, it wastes its actions on feeble gesticulations that suggest it&rsquo;s trying to cast harmful spells at them. It reverts to making normal attacks only if one or more characters enter its reach and make melee attacks against it. If the characters keep their distance and avoid harming the shield guardian, it ends its &ldquo;attack&rdquo; after a few rounds and wanders off, looking for other denizens to terrorize.</p>

Entry Well</h3><p>At the bottom of the Yawning Portal entry well is a dark, 40-foot-square room with the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exits</strong>. The only exit appears to be a tunnel that leads south before bending west. (There&rsquo;s also a one-way secret door to the north.)</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Floor</strong>. A thin layer of sand covers the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Hanging Shields</strong>. Dented, rusty shields adorn the walls, which are also covered with graffiti.</p>

Any character who finds the secret door also notices a 1-inch-diameter hole bored through it at a height of 5 feet. On the north side of the secret door, a human bandit quietly listens at the hole for sounds of newcomers descending the shaft. Upon hearing creatures enter the area, the bandit retreats to warn its confederates in <strong>area areas 6</strong>, <strong>area 8</strong>, and <strong>area 9</strong>. Characters in the room can hear the bandit&rsquo;s soft, retreating footfalls with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

<p>Beyond the pillar forest, the Mad Mage waits.</p>
<p>Casting spells behind magic gates.</p>

<p><strong>Bas-Reliefs</strong>. Every 10-foot section of wall has a 9-foot-high, 4-foot-wide, 3-inch-deep door-shaped recess containing a bas-relief carving of a demon. Each relief depicts a different kind of demon (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Skeleton</strong>. A kenku skeleton lies on the floor, one of its thin arms pointing toward a bas-relief of a nalfeshnee demon on the south wall. (Halaster artfully placed the skeleton here to help adventurers find the secret door to <strong>area area 3</strong>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The carvings on the north wall of <strong>area area 2a</strong> depict (from east to west) a balor, a barlgura, a chasme, a dretch, a glabrezu, a goristro, and a hezrou. The carvings on the south wall depict (from west to east) a marilith, a nalfeshnee, a quasit, a shadow demon, a vrock, and a yochlol. The recessed wall that contains the nalfeshnee carving has a secret door leading to <strong>area area 3</strong>. The recessed wall that contains the dretch carving has another secret door, which leads to <strong>area area 4</strong>. The dretch carving has half-inch spy-holes for eyes.

<p><strong>Snake Skeleton</strong>. The skeleton of a giant constrictor snake coils up the top half of the northernmost pillar. The snake skeleton is harmless and falls apart if disturbed, clattering loudly as it hits the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>. The words &ldquo;Certain death this way!&rdquo; are carved in Common on the southeast wall, with an arrow pointing toward the southern exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bugbears detect the approach of adventurers with the aid of the intellect devourers' Detect Sentience trait and therefore can&rsquo;t be surprised. As intruders approach their location, the bugbears withdraw down the southern tunnel and circle around to warn the goblinoids in <strong>area area 23</strong> of intruders. The bugbears know the perils of the western tunnel (<strong>area area 21</strong>) and avoid it. Characters whose passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) scores equal or exceed the bugbears' Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) checks notice the hiding or fleeing bugbears.</p>
<p>When a bugbear drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer in its skull teleports out to seek a new host.</p>

Slanted Room</h3><p>A secret door opens to reveal an empty 10-foot-square cubicle with a 5-foot-wide tunnel of rough-hewn stone leading away from it. The tunnel descends slightly until it reaches a room that smells like a sewer. The room contains the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Flood</strong>. The floor of the room tiltsâ€”its west end is 6 feet lower than its east end. Foul sewer water covers the floor, barely reaching the east wall but deepening by 1 foot for every 10 feet of travel westward.</p>
<p><strong>Statue</strong>. A wide alcove in the north wall contains a life-size statue of a sahuagin, submerged up to its chest in sewer water. The statue emits a dim purple radiance, its head is completely turned around, and one of its arms has broken off and is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Ooze</strong>. A psychic gray ooze lurks beneath the murky water, north of the statue. (It&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> while underwater.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ooze uses its Psychic Crush action option (see the &ldquo;Variant: Psychic Gray Ooze&rdquo; sidebar in the &ldquo;Oozes&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual) to attack anyone who approaches the statue.</p>

The statue&rsquo;s arm broke off long ago and rests now against the west wall, concealed beneath the dark water.</p>
<p>The statue&rsquo;s head is hollow, with holes for eyes and a larger hole for its fanged mouth. Further inspection reveals that the head has screw threads and is removable. Previous adventurers managed to unscrew it halfway before being scared off by the gray ooze. Unscrewing and removing the head exposes a hidden, charred compartment in the statue&rsquo;s neck. The compartment contains melted wax from candles that were used to illuminate the statue&rsquo;s head like a jack-o'-lantern.</p>

With Sword in Hand</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Sword Stand</strong>. An unadorned wooden armor stand rests in the middle of the room, with a faintly glowing longsword stabbed into it. At the base of the stand lie the skeletal remains of a hand, amid stains of dried blood.</p>
<p><strong>Distant Voices</strong>. Echoes of distant voices occasionally fill the room, emanating from 10-inch-long, 5-inch wide vents in the ceiling (see &ldquo;Echoes&rdquo; below).</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. A secret door leading south is obvious from this side (no ability check required). It has two eye-holes bored into it at a height of 5 feet, allowing a creature to peer into <strong>area area 2a</strong> beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longsword is easy to remove from the armor stand, requiring no ability check. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that the sword is magical. It sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It also carries a curse that prevents its wielder from dropping it. If the blade is pried from its wielder&rsquo;s grasp, it instantly teleports back into the wielder&rsquo;s hand. The curse can be ended by casting a <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> spell or using similar magic on the sword&rsquo;s wielder, or by chopping off the hand that holds the weapon. The skeletal hand on the floor belonged to the orc who last held the sword.</p>

Grell Hideout</h3><p>At the end of a long hall is a 50-foot-square room with five pillars made of mortared humanoid bones, painted black. Two Grell float in separate alcoves to the north and the east. The floors of the alcoves are littered with the gnawed bones of past meals (mostly goblins and gricks).</p>
<p>The deep alcoves and black pillars provide cover for the grells. As the characters move into the room, they can spot one or both grells by succeeding on a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check contested by the monsters' Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) checks. The grells are hungry and eagerly pursue fleeing prey. They have no treasure.</p>

Hall of Three Lords</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Standing atop stone plinths in the middle of the room, facing east, are three 6-foot-tall statues depicting male Waterdavian nobles clad in decorative plate armor.</p>
<p><strong>Bones and Broken Staff</strong>. Lying at the base of the central statue are the bones of a long-dead hobgoblin and a white wooden staff broken in half.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carved into the stone base of each statue is a name: Elyndraun (south statue), Ruathyndar (central statue), and Onthalass (north statue). These names have been crossed out with chalk; beneath them, new names have been added in Goblin: Smelly Bottom, Stupid Skull, and Born Toothless, respectively.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals the faintest, lingering trace of magic within both fragments of the staff. The staff can be repaired with a <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch> cantrip. The first time the intact staff is held, it wails, &ldquo;Help! Thief! Criminal!&rdquo; before its magic fades forever. If the wailing occurs here, the creatures in <strong>area areas 6b</strong> and <strong>area 6c</strong> hear the noise and come to investigate.</p>

Uktarl&rsquo;s Room</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Bandits</strong>. Unless they have been encountered elsewhere, four members of the Undertakers sit around a decrepit wooden table near the door: Uktarl Krannoc (NE human bandit captain with <wc-fetch type=skill>Performance</wc-fetch> +4), two human Bandit, and a doppelganger, all disguised as vampires. They play cards using a marked deck that Uktarl carries around, and each has a stack of coins on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Fresco</strong>. The entire northern wall is one large stone fresco depicting a rugged mountain, hollowed out with caverns containing tiny sculpted figures of dwarves. Behind the mountain, carved rays of brilliant sunlight fan out to the edges of the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Tub</strong>. Beneath the mountain fresco, carved into the floor, is a large, recessed stone tub 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uktarl lies and cheats for fun, and he is quick to blame others for his failings as a leader. If he takes damage or sees any of his underlings slaughtered, cowardice compels him to retreat to <strong>area area 7</strong>. The others flee to <strong>area area 8</strong> and team up with any bandits remaining there.</p>
<p>A character who inspects the stone fresco and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check discovers that one of the tiny dwarf figures is the top of a stone key slotted into a cavity that hides its teeth. The key is easily removed from the fresco and unlocks the stone box in <strong>area area 14b</strong>. The bandits are unaware of the key&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Uktarl keeps his bedroll inside the stone tub, along with a set of thieves' tools and enough stolen gear to create one explorer&rsquo;s pack.</p>

<p>The throne&rsquo;s serpent armrests magically animate and bite anyone who sits on the throne or raises the seat&rsquo;s lid. Each snake makes a single melee weapon attack (+8 to hit) and deals 3 (<wc-roll>1d4 + 1</wc-roll>) piercing damage on a hit. Any creature bitten by a snake must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (<wc-roll>7d6</wc-roll>) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Heart in a Box</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Acid</strong>. The room&rsquo;s domed ceiling is 15 feet high at the edges and 30 feet high in the middle. The dome is filled with sizzling acid that defies gravity as it floats 15 feet above the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Statue</strong>. An 8-foot-tall statue of a four-armed fish monster (a <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> sahuagin baron with no trident) stands in the middle of the room, facing north. Its webbed hands clutch an ornate, 1-foot-square stone box with a lid and a keyhole (see &ldquo;Box&rdquo; below).</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. At the north end of the east wall is a secret door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The acid floating in the domed area overhead is held there by magic. Opening the stone box without using the proper key causes the acid to fall. When the acid falls, each creature in the room takes 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) acid damage. Any creature that starts its turn in the acid takes the same damage again. The acid floods the room to a depth of 5 feet and flows 40 feet out into the hall leading back to <strong>area area 14a</strong> before slowly draining out through tiny holes in the floor, losing 1 foot of depth per minute.</p>

Prying it from the statue&rsquo;s grasp requires a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check and causes the <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> sahuagin baron to revert to flesh, attacking with its teeth and claws.</p>
<p>The box&rsquo;s key is hidden in <strong>area area 6c</strong>. The box can also be opened with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or unlocked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Opening the box without the proper key, however, causes the acid overhead to plunge.</p>
<p>The box&rsquo;s interior is lined with thin sheets of lead to thwart certain forms of divination magic, including the <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell. Inside the box is the dry, withered heart of a tiefling wizard (see <strong>area area 24b</strong>). A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of necromancy magic around the heart, while an <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals its magical properties. A creature that has a heart in its own body can attune to the withered heart as though it were a magic item. When it does so, the withered heart switches places with the attuned creature&rsquo;s living heart, which has the effect of killing the creature instantly. The creature&rsquo;s living heart then withers and dies, and it gains the same properties as the tiefling&rsquo;s heart, allowing it to be passed on in the same way.</p>

<p><strong>Petrified Creatures</strong>. Eleven lifelike statues in a variety of poses are clustered together in the south end of the room. (These statues are <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> creatures.)</p>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Alcoves along the walls once held six statues, but five of them lie toppled and smashed to pieces on the floor. The sixth statue, located in the middle alcove along the east wall, remains intact and appears to be made of glistening black stone. (The sheen is due to a black pudding that coats the statue.)</p>

<p>The black pudding has 120 hit points and is held in stasis by Halaster&rsquo;s magic. The stasis ends and the pudding attacks if it is touched or harmed.</p>
<p>The statue&rsquo;s stone features are impossible to discern while the black pudding covers it. Once the pudding sloughs off, characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check realize that the statue depicts Gond, the god of invention. A character who worships Gond automatically succeeds on the check. The five toppled statues once depicted other gods, but now they lie smashed beyond recognition.</p>
<p>The assembly of <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> creatures includes five unfortunate adventurers (a male human, a male half-orc, a female elf, and two male halflings) and six unlucky monsters (two kobolds, three goblins, and a carrion crawler).</p>

Hall of Mirrors</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Mirrors</strong>. Niches, each 3 feet deep, line the north and south walls. Mounted on the back wall inside each one is a large, oval glass mirror in a heavy stone frameâ€”sixteen mirrors in all.</p>
<p><strong>Torch Stub</strong>. The blackened end of a burnt-out torch lies on the floor in the middle of the corridor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five of the sixteen mirrors are magical and radiate auras of illusion magic while in the area of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell. When a humanoid passes between the two westernmost mirrors, a shadowy duplicate of that creature emerges from each of those mirrors. These duplicates are hostile toward all creatures except each other. A duplicate reduced to 0 hit points or targeted by a <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell vanishes in a wisp of inky smoke. Otherwise, each duplicate disappears after 1 minute. The duplicates use the shadow statistics, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duplicates are unaligned constructs similar in size to the creature that spawned them. (Each duplicate&rsquo;s hit points stay the same regardless of the original creature&rsquo;s size.)</li>
<li>They can&rsquo;t create undead shadows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three other mirrors (your choice) are empty frames containing illusory glass that has no substance. These false mirrors conceal small shelves that are carved into the walls behind them. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on one of these mirrors ends the illusion and reveals the hidden shelf beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Cleft Shield</strong>. Two halves of a cloven wooden shield lie in the room&rsquo;s northwest corner. Each half of the cloven shield has letters etched into it. One half reads &ldquo;Nimr.&rdquo; The other reads &ldquo;aith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The goblins fearfully obey the bugbears in <strong>area area 23b</strong>. If their leaders are killed, the goblins flee to <strong>area area 28</strong> (by way of <strong>area areas 24</strong> and <strong>area 25</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Shattered Statue</strong>. The remains of a shattered statue lie in the middle of the room. (The bugbears are trying to reassemble it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bugbears detect the approach of adventurers with the aid of the intellect devourers' Detect Sentience trait and therefore can&rsquo;t be surprised. When a bugbear drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer inhabiting its skull teleports away to seek a new host.</p>
<p>This nonmagical statue has broken into seventeen fist-sized chunks of black stone. (Restoring it will take the bugbears a month.) Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain what the statue depicted: three male human warriors standing together on a stone mound, facing outward and clutching swords.</p>

<p><strong>Bas-Relief</strong>. Carved into the back wall of this alcove is a shallow niche containing a bas-relief sculpture of a nude, heavyset man playing a harp (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Half a Pole</strong>. Lying on the floor of the alcove is a broken half of a 10-foot pole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close inspection of the bas-relief reveals the following inscription carved into the harp, in Common:</p>
<p>Gaze upon me with bronzed visage</p>
<p>And secrets shall I reveal.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals a strong aura of conjuration magic in the alcove. Any character who steps into the alcove wearing the bronze Halaster mask found in <strong>area area 21</strong> is transported to a demiplane (see &ldquo;Demiplane&rdquo; below). Any nonmagical object anchoring the character to the Material Plane, such as a rope or a pole held by another creature, is sheared or snapped off as the character crosses the threshold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Misty Portal</strong>. A mist-filled open doorway leads back to the dungeon alcove on the Material Plane.</p>
<p><strong>Half a Pole</strong>. The other half of the broken 10-foot pole lies on the floor just inside the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>Portrait</strong>. Hanging upside down on one wall is a tall, wood-framed painting of Halaster Blackcloak.</p>
<p><strong>Simulacrum</strong>. Seated in a high-backed oak chair in front of the painting is a simulacrum of the Mad Mage himself (created by the <wc-fetch type=spell>simulacrum</wc-fetch> spell).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it meets a character for the first time, Halaster&rsquo;s simulacrum says, &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t just stand there like a boob. Ask me three questions about Undermountain. Two of my answers will be true, and one will be false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simulacrum knows everything that Halaster knows and makes good on its offer, answering the character&rsquo;s first question with a lie and the second and third questions with the truth. After answering three questions, it turns to slush and is destroyed. The simulacrum won&rsquo;t provide any additional information and can&rsquo;t leave the demiplane. The demiplane remains even after the simulacrum is destroyed.</p>
<p>Removing the Halaster mask does not affect the demiplane. By tossing the mask through the misty doorway, a character inside the demiplane can enable others to use it to enter from the Material Plane.</p>

Obelisk of the Eye</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Obelisk</strong>. In the north end of this room stands a 14-foot-tall granite obelisk with a lidless eye carved near its top on the south-facing side. The bottom half of the obelisk is covered with dirty, bloody handprints.</p>
<p><strong>Alcoves</strong>. Wide alcoves surround the obelisk to the west, north, and east. They contain a dozen goblin beds made of bundled rugs and torn fabric. (The beds have nothing of value.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals a faint aura of divination magic surrounding the obelisk, and the goblinoids believe (incorrectly) that Xanathar can see through the obelisk&rsquo;s eye to keep watch on them.</p>
<p>The first character to touch the obelisk with a bare hand receives the following telepathic message in Common: &ldquo;I cast my eye into the future and see in yours a perilous descent. South of here, beyond a secret passage, waits the Two-Headed King. Look to his left. There you will see the path you are destined to take.&rdquo; These words seem to emanate from within the obelisk and are meant to sound soothing, but a character who hears the words can discern a hint of subdued madness in them with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check. (The obelisk was created by Halaster and sounds just like him.) The obelisk&rsquo;s &ldquo;vision&rdquo; refers to the secret passage at <strong>area area 38</strong>, the two-headed statue in <strong>area area 39a</strong>, and the stairs west of the statue that lead down to level 2.</p>
<p>Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the obelisk renders it nonfunctional. Toppling the obelisk requires a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check and causes it to break into myriad pieces on the floor.</p>

The lid remains open for 1 hour, then automatically snaps shut as the trap resets.</p>
<p>A character searching the tunnel for traps spots the pit with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Hammering spikes between the edges of the lid and the surrounding walls keeps the pit from opening.</p>

<p><strong>Wererat</strong>. A wererat named Sylvia Featherstone scours the hall in her giant rat form.</p>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Cobweb-covered statues of dwarves stand atop 2-foot-high pedestals in alcoves. (One of the northernmost statues has been pushed aside, leaving grooves in the floor and clearing a path to a secret door that opens into a tunnel connecting with <strong>area area 30b</strong>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If cornered, Sylvia assumes hybrid form and claims that she is searching the dungeon for food. If accused of lying, she explains that she is looking for treasure to buy food in Skullport (which is another lie). In fact, Sylvia is one of Xanathar&rsquo;s spies and is searching for secret doors that lead to unexplored areas of the dungeonâ€”information the beholder considers valuable. If threatened, she tries to rejoin her companion in <strong>area area 35</strong>. If captured, she takes every opportunity to try to escape. She wears no armor, carries no weapons, and has nothing of value on her. She is familiar with levels 1, 2, and 3 of Undermountain but lies about what&rsquo;s there unless magically compelled to speak the truth.</p>

Hall of Rats</h3><p>The door to this room hangs slightly ajar, and the sound of squeaking rats emanates from within. The room has these features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Giant Rats</strong>. Ten Giant Rat scour the room for food.</p>
<p><strong>Wererat</strong>. An obese giant rat is sleeping on the seat of a crumbling stone throne that stands on a dais opposite the door. (This creature is a shapechanged wererat named Flyndol Greeth.)</p>
<p><strong>Fountains</strong>. Not visible from the door are two semicircular fountains built into the south wall, one in each half of the room (see &ldquo;Fountains&rdquo; below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flyndol Greeth is a lazy wererat who serves Xanathar out of fear, not loyalty. He&rsquo;s waiting for his companion, Sylvia, to return (see <strong>area area 31</strong>). If threatened, Flyndol commands the giant rats to cover his escape. If escape is impossible, he surrenders but won&rsquo;t give his captors any useful information unless they charm him. He carries nothing of value.</p>

Carved above each basin is a bas-relief of a dwarf&rsquo;s face with an open mouth. Water from an underground river once flowed out of the mouths and into the basins, but no longer. Both basins are dry, and the dwarves' stone beards are stained and discolored.</p>

<p><strong>Trapped Adventurer</strong>. The sound of weeping comes from behind a closed door in the west wall (leading to a 10-foot-square closet). A small hole has been drilled through the middle of the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An adventuring party called the Fine Fellows of Daggerford descended into Undermountain one tenday ago. One of its members, a thief named Kelim the Weasel (NE human spy), wandered off, snuck into this corner of the dungeon, found a spellbook left behind by a long-dead adventurer, and inadvertently aroused the gricks. With his escape route cut off, Kelim sealed himself in the closet to avoid being eaten. He drilled a small hole in the door so that he could peer out of it and get some fresher air. He wants to sneak out while the gricks are asleep or distracted, but he&rsquo;s too scared to leave. He has been without food or water for two days.</p>
<p>If rescued, Kelim gives his saviors a stolen spellbook as a token of gratitude. Beyond that, he&rsquo;s an unreliable coward who will betray anyone to save his own skin. He doesn&rsquo;t know where the rest of his adventuring party is (see level 2) and doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.</p>

<p><strong>Reverse Gravity</strong>. Directly above the grick, on the 20-foot-high ceiling, is an upside-down stone throne, seated upon which is a mummified minotaur with gems embedded in its eyes (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). A greataxe lies at the foot of the throne.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Flaming Skull</strong>. This carving represents Skullport. Each time this button is pressed, a magical, disembodied male voice fills the room and says in Common, &ldquo;Gate access to Skullport disabled.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Comet:</strong> This carving represents Stardock, the asteroid orbiting Toril that is connected by a gate to level 16. Each time this button is pressed, a magical, disembodied male voice fills the room and says in Common, &ldquo;Gate access to Stardock from level 16 only.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Tower</strong>. This carving represents Halaster&rsquo;s extradimensional tower, and the tiny glyph above it is Halaster&rsquo;s rune.

Halleth &ldquo;awoke&rdquo; the next day as a revenant, compelled to find and kill the three who murdered him. Unfortunately for him, he is unable to climb out of the pit without assistance and has been pacing down there for days.</p>
<p>If the characters pull him up, Halleth points to the secret door in the south wall and offers to join the party until he locates his &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; a shield dwarf named Copper Stormforge and two humans named Midna Tauberth and Rex the Hammer. Halleth no longer has access to his cleric spells, and his companions stole his gear (including his holy symbol), along with a wholly incorrect map of the Sargauth Level (level 3). He is willing to let the characters keep the map once they help him confront his killers and retrieve it. He believes the map is authentic and accurate. When the three Fine Fellows die, Halleth becomes a corpse again; if the characters helped him, award them XP as though they had defeated the revenant in combat. See level 2 for more information on Halleth&rsquo;s killers.</p>

Hall of the Two-Headed King</h4><p>Characters will most likely enter this hall through the secret door in the west wall. This 30-foot-high room has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Statue</strong>. A deformed granite statue stands on the east side of a large stone column, facing eastward.</p>
<p><strong>Staircase</strong>. West of the statue, stairs descend 200 feet to level 2. (These stairs are not immediately visible to characters entering through the secret door.)</p>
<p><strong>Noise</strong>. The sound of squabbling goblins emanates from a tunnel leading north.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statue is life-size and depicts a dwarf king standing atop a 3-foot-high stone pedestal. Sprouting from the king&rsquo;s neck is a deformed, mostly featureless second head with an elongated, toothless mouth. The inscriptions on the pedestal have been worn away. On the king&rsquo;s brow rests an engraved stone circlet, and his large hands grasp the handle of a stone warhammer, the head of which is planted at his feet.</p>
<p>Halaster used <wc-fetch type=spell>stone shape</wc-fetch> spells to create the statue&rsquo;s second head and rub away the inscriptions on the pedestal. Even the Mad Mage is unaware, however, that the statue hides a secret. Any character who examines the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices that the king&rsquo;s warhammer is a separate piece of stone that can be rotated. When the warhammer is turned so that the weapon&rsquo;s backside faces forward, the pedestal rises another 3 feet, revealing an open cavity that contains a magic circlet identical to the one worn by the statueâ€”but fashioned from gold rather than stone.</p>

<p><strong>Ettins</strong>. Two Ettin, a female named Krung-Jung and a male named Bokk-Nokkin, live in this foul-smelling room. Branded on each of their foreheads is the symbol of Xanathar: a circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from it and a dot in the center.</p>
<p><strong>Forge</strong>. A blackened forge dominates the north wall. The magic that once heated the forge expired long ago. The ettins keep their treasure inside it (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). An iron anvil stands atop a 3-foot-high circular stone dais in front of the hearth.</p>
<p><strong>Hammer</strong>. Hanging above the anvil from thick iron chains is a 7,000-pound stone hammer, 10 feet long and 8 feet wide. Carved into one side of its stone head are the Dwarvish runes for earth and water; the other side is carved with similar runes for air and fire.</p>
<p><strong>Trophies</strong>. A 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-long, 2-foot-high slab of stone dominates the southeast corner of the forge. The ettins' latest trophiesâ€”two dead and rotting carrion crawlersâ€”lie atop it.</p>

<p><strong>Mimic</strong>. Stone rubble is piled up behind the statue in the southernmost alcove. The spear held by this statue appears to be made of gold. (Both this statue and its spear are a mimic. The creature uses its fake gold spear as a lure.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mimic is a Large specimen with 75 (<wc-roll>10d10 + 20</wc-roll>) hit points. It knocked over the original statue and pushed the broken pieces into the back of the alcove, assuming the shape of the statue afterward.</p>

<p><strong>Tools</strong>. Old pickaxes and shovels are stored in two stone wheelbarrows parked in the northwest corner.</p>

The gang&rsquo;s removal, however, also allows bugbears, goblins, wererats, and other Xanathar Guild operatives to set up new watch posts in the bandits' former hideouts.</p>
<p>Destroying the Xanathar Guild outposts makes this level a much safer place for a while, but it also spells the end of the force that kept the grells, the gricks, and other predatory monsters in check. Such creatures begin to expand their territory, occasionally bumping up against one another with predictably bloody results.</p>
<p>One thing that never changes is the steady influx of new blood from the Yawning Portal. At any time, another group of adventurers might descend to seek their fortune in Undermountain. Such a group, perhaps encountered as the characters make their way back to Waterdeep, could greet the characters as friendly rivals or as competition that must be eliminated.</p>
