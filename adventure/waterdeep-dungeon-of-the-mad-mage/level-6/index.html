<p>The Lost Level is designed for four 9th-level characters, and characters who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance halfway to 10th level. This level was a temple complex dedicated to the dwarven god Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain. Hidden inside is the tomb of Melair, king of the Melairkyn dwarves.</p>
<p>Before running this level, review the &ldquo;Duergar&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual. That information will help you run and roleplay the duergar NPCs found throughout the Lost Level.</p>

They are assisted in this effort by two cloakers from the conclave on level 5, which hope to turn this level into a hunting ground. After gaining entry through an umber hulk tunnel that leads down from level 5, the raiders managed to loot several rooms. But a combination of traps and unexpected monsters has diminished their numbers and dimmed their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Skella is obsessed by artistry and beauty, in stark contrast to the usual duergar focus on utility. The duergar she leads are content to follow her for the sake of what their raids will earn them, and they care nothing for the historical value of the relics they steal and destroy. Skella is willing to parley with adventurers and stay out of their way in exchange for a chance to plunder more of the dungeon and leave in one piece. Her lawful nature means she will abide by the terms of any bargain, but she turns against the adventurers if she senses a hint of betrayal.</p>
<p>In addition to various treasures plundered from this level, Skella has a dagger she stole from Azrok, the hobgoblin warlord who rules Stromkuhldur on level 3 of Undermountain (see &ldquo;<strong>area Legion of Azrok</strong>"). Returning this dagger to Azrok completes a side quest.</p>

<p>A wandering umber hulk detects nearby characters with its <wc-fetch type=sense>tremorsense</wc-fetch>. Such a creature might come stomping down a corridor toward them at any time, smashing through any doors in its path. Or it could burrow through a wall to reach the characters, exploding forth in a hail of stone fragments. If a wandering umber hulk is defeated, remove it from <strong>area area 26</strong> or have only one umber hulk in <strong>area area 34</strong>. If the characters have already defeated the three umber hulks in those areas, assume this wandering one is a new arrival.</p>

<p>Many of the stone doors on this level have been demolished by the umber hulks. Creatures can move through the debris without penalty.</p>
<p>Quartz pillars found throughout the Lost Level shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Casting a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell on a pillar (DC 12) extinguishes its magical light forever, as does destroying the pillar. A quartz pillar is a Huge object with AC 11, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The quartz pillars aren&rsquo;t load-bearing, and their destruction won&rsquo;t trigger a roof collapse. Characters who have the Stonecunning trait can discern this fact by examining the pillars (no check required).</p>

Library and Scriptorium</h3><p>Dwarves only rarely commit words to paper, making this dwarven library a rare find. Characters who make no effort to conceal their approach are detected by the creatures in this room, which has a 20-foot-high vaulted ceiling. The room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shelves</strong>. Scrolls bound in copper wire line stone shelves embedded in the east and west walls.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters</strong>. Four duergar are rooting through the collected works, and a single cloaker lurks in the shadows of the vaulted ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Ladders</strong>. Sliding iron ladders on rails allow access to the tallest shelves, which top out at 15 feet high.</p>
<p><strong>Desks</strong>. Two rows of stone desks and chairs face the entrance. The tops of the desks are angled slightly and have inkwells carved into them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caught off guard by the arrival of visitors, the duergar instinctively enlarge themselves and attack. If two duergar fall in battle, the survivors turn <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and flee to <strong>area area 12</strong> while the cloaker covers their escape.</p>
<p>The holy texts and scrolls in this room are brittle and fall apart easily. Most of the manuscripts describe the day-to-day religious observations of the priests of Dumathoin. A character who spends at least 1 hour poring over the archives can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check, discern the location of the temple of Dumathoin (<strong>area area 15</strong>). The character also gains advantage on ability checks to find secret doors on this level.</p>

<p><strong>Frescoes</strong>. The walls are carved with frescoes depicting dwarves defending their mountain homes against ankhegs, purple worms, umber hulks, and other burrowing monsters. (Hidden behind a fresco of a dwarf battling a bulette is a secret door that leads to <strong>area area 8b</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Donkeys</strong>. Standing around the room are five crude wooden constructs resembling donkeys. Each of these magic dummies has a body made of a wooden keg turned on its side. A head and neck made of wood and sackcloth is attached to one end of the keg. At the other end is a tail made from a straw broom. Each keg is held up by four 2-foot-long peg legs.</p>

<p>When a Small or Medium humanoid sits atop a wooden donkey, it moves and attacks as directed by its rider. Each donkey has the statistics of a mule, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wooden donkey is a construct with <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 30 feet. It is blind beyond this radius.</li>

<p>The occupants of this area are tenuous allies. The duergar attack anyone they don&rsquo;t recognize, and the xorn assist as best they can. If the duergar are defeated, the xorn disengage from combat on their next turn and flee by burrowing into the walls.

<p><strong>Quartz Pillars</strong>. The glow from four quartz pillars reflects off flecks of quartz embedded in the walls.</p>
<p><strong>Engraved Doors</strong>. The double doors to the south are engraved with the image of a mountain with a gem-shaped indentation at its core (the symbol of Dumathoin). The edges of the indentation serve as handles that enable the doors to be pulled open.</p>

<p>The first time a creature passes between the quartz pillars to the north, a booming, disembodied voice says in Dwarvish, &ldquo;Neither secrets nor treasures shall ye find! Turn back!

Nave</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Monsters</strong>. Eight duergar plus their leader, a half-shield dwarf, half-duergar named Skella Ironeye, are scattered throughout the area. Two Cloaker flap above them, circling the nave at a height of 20 feet. The cloakers consider the duergar their allies.</p>
<p><strong>Quartz Pillars</strong>. Glowing quartz pillars stand around the temple perimeter, carved to look like natural columns. The glowing pillars have the appearance of buttresses, but only the four stone pillars in the middle of the nave support the roof.</p>
<p><strong>Dais</strong>. At the south end of the temple, stone steps climb 10 feet to a golden marble dais (<strong>area area 15b</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although her mother was a shield dwarf, Skella has the statistics of a duergar with 40 hit points. She has also attuned to a magic dagger that gives her <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 30 feet (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>When Skella and her duergar subordinates climbed to the top of the dais, the altar there released a clay golem that attacked them (see <strong>area area 15b</strong>). Four duergar were smashed to a pulp before Skella realized that their weapons were having no effect on the golem. She ordered her remaining forces to fall back, whereupon the golem withdrew to the altar once more.</p>
<p>Skella is prepared to let the adventurers take a crack at defeating the golem, so that she can find out what lies beyond the basalt doors. When the characters arrive, she tries to forge a truce with them, promising them safe passage through the Lost Level if they defeat the golem and depart the temple. Being lawful, she is inclined to uphold her end of the agreement as long as the characters don&rsquo;t cross her.</p>

Fastened to her belt in plain view is a small gold figurine of a female elf holding up a symbol of the sun (25 gp). This figurine is the key to opening the arch gate in <strong>area area 27</strong>.</p>
<p>Tucked in a sheath strapped to Skella&rsquo;s right boot is a <wc-fetch type=item>dagger of blindsight</wc-fetch>. The magic dagger was stolen from the hobgoblin warlord Azrok on level 3 and is the subject of a potential side quest (see &ldquo;<strong>area Legion of Azrok</strong>"). This rare magic item requires attunement. A creature attuned to it gains <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 30 feet. The dagger has a saw-toothed edge and a black pearl nested in its pommel.</p>
<p>Two other duergar carry treasures plundered from the other areas of this level in gray, soot-stained sacks. The sacks contain the other items stolen from <strong>area area 11c</strong>â€”an onyx smoking pipe (75 gp), a fist-sized diamond (1,000 gp), a red crystal tankard (250 gp), an elf warrior&rsquo;s golden gauntlet (250 gp), and a golden belt with an obsidian buckle and studs (250 gp).</p>

Dais</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Corpses</strong>. Four mutilated duergar corpses are sprawled on the steps of the dais.</p>
<p><strong>Altar and Statues</strong>. A clay altar is flanked by 10-foot-tall statues of dwarves outfitted in ceremonial purple-and-gold armor and eyeless helms. (The statues are impressive-looking but harmless.)</p>
<p><strong>Basalt Doors</strong>. At the back of the dais stands a set of double doors made of carved black basalt, flanked by two glowing quartz pillars. Above the double doors is a bas-relief carving of a mountain with a gem at its heart (the symbol of Dumathoin).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The altar is a block of clay 7 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet high. When any creature moves within 20 feet of it, an 8-foot-tall clay golem with dwarf-like proportions erupts from an extradimensional space inside the altar. The golem can exit or enter the altar as an action. The altar is impervious to damage.</p>
<p>The golem can&rsquo;t be reasoned with. It enters the altar again only if it perceives no threats on the dais. If it goes berserk, the golem abandons its role as guardian and leaves the dais in pursuit of fleeing creatures.</p>
<p>If the characters defeat the golem or lure it away, any duergar in the temple seize the chance to approach the black basalt doors and inspect them more closely.</p>
<h5 id=basalt-doors>
<a href=#basalt-doors class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Basalt Doors</h5><p>These matte black doors are impervious to damage and held shut by a power that neither magic nor force can overcome. The doors appear to absorb all light, but a close inspection reveals Dwarvish inscriptions carved into them that translate as follows: &ldquo;It is the will of the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain that only the hand of the king may open these doors. Let all who enter gaze upon the heart of Melairbode and know the true power of dwarvenkind.&rdquo; Any character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check knows that Melairbode is the name of the ancient dwarven realm beneath Mount Waterdeep, whose Underhalls were the foundations of Undermountain.</p>
<p>If the hand of a living or dead dwarf king is pressed against either door, both doors swing slowly inward, revealing <strong>area area 16</strong> beyond. (The characters can find such an appendage in King Melair&rsquo;s true tomb, <strong>area area 29f</strong>.) If the doors are touched by anything other than the hand of a dwarf king, the symbol of Dumathoin above the double doors casts a <em>Bigby&rsquo;s hand</em> spell.</p>
<p>The shimmering hand created by the spell has 80 hit points and a +6 bonus to initiative. (See the spell description for the hand&rsquo;s other statistics.) On each of its turns, this hand flies up to 60 feet and makes one clenched fist attack against a random creature on the dais. The spell has a duration of 1 minute. It can be triggered repeatedly, though a new hand can&rsquo;t come forth until an existing one is gone.</p>

Heart of the Mountain</h3><p>The Melairkyn dwarves carved this 20-foot-high room out of the rock at the point they believed was the heart of their subterranean realm. The features of this room are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Door Handles</strong>. The black basalt doors leading to the dais (<strong>area area 15b</strong>) have handles on this side and are easily pulled open from within.</p>
<p><strong>Mithral Veins</strong>. Thin veins of mithral spread across the hewn walls, looking like gleaming cracks in the stone.</p>
<p><strong>Tapestry</strong>. A huge tapestry depicting a dwarven kingdom under a mountain hangs from an iron rail and spans the south wall. The tapestry is so old that it begins to crumble if any attempt is made to handle or move it.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror</strong>. A tall oval mirror is mounted on the east wall. Carved into its stone frame are dozens of lidless eyes and the following phrase in Common: &ldquo;The gate cannot hide from those it cannot see.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While in this room, dwarf characters can sense the immense weight of the mountain gently pressing down on them and realize subconsciously that they can attune to this room as though it were a magic item. A <wc-fetch type=spell>legend lore</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals that this room sits at the heart of the mountain and that the Melairkyn dwarves came here to learn secrets and receive divine guidance.</p>
<p>While attuned to the room and inside it, a dwarf can cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>divination</wc-fetch> spell at will. Answers provided by the spell come from an unknown source (perhaps the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain, perhaps the mountain itself). Too many castings of the spell in a short amount of time can lead to false readings, as noted in the spell&rsquo;s description.</p>
<p>Creatures that finish a short or long rest in this chamber absorb some of the strength of the mountain around them and gain 10 temporary hit points, or 20 temporary hit points if the creature is a dwarf. Once a creature gains this benefit, it can&rsquo;t do so again until the next dawn, and then only after finishing a short or long rest.</p>

<li>Characters must be 11th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

<p><strong>Quartz Pillars</strong>. The room is brightly lit by four quartz pillars.</p>

The rules of this gate are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touching the arch with a nonmagical item made entirely of ferrous metal (such as an iron spike) reduces the item to powdered rust and opens the gate for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Characters must be 6th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

The hulk&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=sense>tremorsense</wc-fetch> allows it to detect other creatures approaching on foot. When the characters get close, it crashes through the wall north of the doorway, hoping to surprise them.</p>
<p>The dwarves kept alcoholic spirits here. The beverages are long evaporated, and the umber hulk has pulverized the stone shelves, vats, and bottles that remain. Nothing here is salvageable.</p>

<p>The arch is one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). Its rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the elf figurine taken from Skella in <strong>area area 15a</strong> is touched to the sun symbol, the gate opens for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Characters must be 8th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

False Tomb</h3><p>This chamber is dressed to fool treasure seekers into thinking they have found the tomb of the Melairkyn king. Its features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quartz Pillars</strong>. Six glowing quartz pillars fill the room with bright light.</p>
<p><strong>Detritus</strong>. Rusted helms, shields, armor fragments, and weapons cover the floor. This detritus makes the entire room difficult terrain. (The arms and armor were fashioned by orcs, goblinoids, drow, duergar, and other enemies of the dwarves. No dwarven items can be found among the wreckage.)</p>
<p><strong>Sarcophagus</strong>. A deep alcove in the north wall is mostly clear of metal wreckage and contains a shattered stone sarcophagus. Engraved in the back wall of the alcove is a Dwarvish inscription that reads, &ldquo;Our king is with the gods. Here lie his bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. A secret door in the south wall swings open into <strong>area area 29a</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dwarven bones are scattered around the smashed sarcophagus, but a character who studies the wreckage and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check can tell that the scene has been cleverly staged to fool tomb robbers.</p>

Second False Tomb</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Ceiling</strong>. This tomb has a 10-foot-high, vaulted ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Sarcophagus</strong>. A black marble sarcophagus flecked with gold stands close to the south wall, its lid carved in the likeness of a dwarf king.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal Panels</strong>. Ten glittering panels are set into the west, south, and east walls. Each panel is a 6-foot-tall, 3-foot-wide, 1-inch-thick rectangle of golden crystal, carved with the bas-relief image of a dwarf warrior clutching a battleaxe. (The panel in the middle of the south wall is set into a secret door that swings open into <strong>area area 29b</strong>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lid of the sarcophagus can be lifted by creatures with a combined Strength of 20 or more. Removing the lid triggers a <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell that admonishes interlopers in Dwarvish: &ldquo;You dishonor our beloved king! May his tomb become yours as well!&rdquo; After this warning, all ten battleaxes break free of their panels (whether on the walls or not; see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;) and attack the tomb&rsquo;s interlopers. Use the flying sword statistics for each crystal battleaxe.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus contains tatters of a black shroud, the dust and bones of a nameless dwarf, and the bones of a mole that was accidentally sealed in with the dwarf&rsquo;s remains.</p>

Gods and Demons</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Watching over this chamber are four 9-foot-tall stone statues of imperious dwarves.</p>
<p><strong>Tapestry</strong>. Hanging on the south wall between the statues of Moradin and Berronar is a thick tapestry depicting King Melair, his adamantine war pick in hand as he battles a purple worm. (The tapestry is too moldy and frayed to be worth anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Magic Wall</strong>. The wall behind the tapestry is a magical conjuration. It doesn&rsquo;t detect as such under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell, but it vanishes if targeted by a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 16). It also ceases to exist while contained in the area of an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> spell. It otherwise looks and feels solid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statues represent the dwarven deities Moradin (god of creation), Berronar Truesilver (god of hearth and home), Clangeddin Silverbeard (god of battle), and Marthammor Duin (god of exploration). A demon is trapped in each statue (see &ldquo;Trapped Demons&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>Each statue is a Large object with AC 15, 100 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Toppling a statue requires a successful DC 22 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A statue that topples or takes 10 or more damage cracks enough for the demon inside to erupt in a cloud of reeking black mist. It then coalesces into its true form in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>

Over the centuries of its confinement, the glabrezu has learned how to telepathically contact creatures in this room. Using its telepathy, it tries to trick an interloper into freeing it. Though the other three demons have telepathy, they are not powerful enough to use the ability while trapped in their statues.</p>
<p>The glabrezu makes telepathic contact with one character at random, congratulating that character on making it this far and claiming to have the knowledge and power to reveal the way to King Melair&rsquo;s true tomb. It promises (truthfully) to do so in exchange for its release from captivity. If the glabrezu is released, it casts <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the wall behind the tapestry, granting access to areas <strong>area 29e</strong> and <strong>area 29f</strong>, then lets the characters desecrate King Melair&rsquo;s tomb before it attacks them. If it needs allies, it knocks over more of the statues to free the other demons. These weaker demons obey the glabrezu for as long as it benefits them to do so.</p>
<p>If the first character it approaches refuses to help the glabrezu escape, it makes contact with each of the other party members in turn. If it realizes none of the characters can be swayed, it screams vile epithets and vows to destroy them whenever it is set free.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is undead and has 125 hit points.</li>
<li>It has vulnerability to radiant damage, resistance to necrotic damage, and immunity to poison damage and the <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> condition.</li>

<p>When a weight of 50 pounds or more is placed on the cover of the pit trap, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing any creature standing on it to fall in.

Arch Gate to Level 8</h4><p>This room is empty except for an arch embedded in the northeast wall. This arch is one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). The space inside the arch bears a bas-relief of a female dwarf standing with her eyes closed. A large keyhole is carved into the head of a stone hammer she clutches to her chest. The rules of this gate are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the stone key from <strong>area area 14a on level 2</strong> is inserted into the keyhole, the bas-relief and the key vanish as the gate opens for 1 minute. When the gate closes, the bas-relief reappears, and the key is ejected from its keyhole.</li>
<li>A character can open the gate without the stone key by using an action to pick the lock, requiring a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. On a failed check, the dwarf&rsquo;s eyes open and shoot forth beams of light. Each creature within 10 feet of the arch must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li>Characters must be 10th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 3 on level 8</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>

<p><strong>Open Pit</strong>. In front of the statue is a 10-foot-deep open pit whose bottom is set with spring-loaded iron jaws, around which are chunks of rock and dwarven bones.</p>

<p>A temple acolyte found this shrine but failed to notice the pit, which was hidden under a false stone floor. When the false floor broke apart underfoot, the dwarf fell into the snapping iron jaws below. The false floor was never replaced, nor was the acolyte&rsquo;s body removed.

A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals no magical auras around the staff fragments. Each of the staff&rsquo;s five pieces is worth 100 gp for the jade alone. The missing piece is the middle section of the staff, currently in the clutches of a bullywug (see <strong>area level 8, area 19c</strong>). Pieces one and two (the top two sections of the staff) can be restored to a single section with a <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch> cantrip, as can pieces four and five (the bottom two sections).</p>
<p>If the fifth piece is found, the entire staff can be restored with <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch> cantrips; each casting of the spell repairs one break in the staff. If the staff is made whole, it transforms from an object into an animated jade serpent that has the statistics of a giant poisonous snake, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The serpent is a construct that understands and obeys whoever was holding the staff when it transformed.</li>
<li>It has immunity to poison damage and the <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> condition. It doesn&rsquo;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
<li>When it drops to 0 hit points, roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll>. On a roll of 1, the snake turns to dust and is destroyed. On any other roll, it changes back into a staff and breaks into <wc-roll>1d4 + 1</wc-roll> pieces that must be magically mended before the staff can be used again.</li>

<p><strong>Bones</strong>. A dwarven skull and twelve rotted bones swirl gently around each other in midair in the middle of the room.</p>
<p><strong>Debris</strong>. On the floor beneath where the bones are circling lies a shattered stone coffer.</p>
<p><strong>Niche</strong>. Carved into the west wall is an empty niche. (The coffer once rested here.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A dwarf priest named Mornhyld Crystalmantle bound her spirit to Undermountain for eternity. Most of her bones turned to dust long ago. What&rsquo;s left of the dwarf floats above the shattered coffer, courtesy of Halaster&rsquo;s magic. Casting a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell on the bones (DC 16) ends the effect and causes the skeletal remains to clatter to the floor.</p>
<p>Mornhyld&rsquo;s disembodied spirit can sense when any humanoid moves within 5 feet of the bones, and it immediately tries to possess that creature. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or become possessed by Mornhyld. While possessed, the target is <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> and loses control of its body, though it retains its awareness. The possession lasts until the target&rsquo;s body drops to 0 hit points, the target leaves the room, Mornhyld&rsquo;s spirit ends the effect as a bonus action, or the spirit is forced out by an effect such as the <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel evil and good</wc-fetch> spell. The creature is immune to the spirit&rsquo;s possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</p>
<p>If Mornhyld&rsquo;s spirit fails to possess a creature, it can try to possess another creature on its next turn. The spirit has a +1 bonus to initiative.</p>
<p>Mornhyld&rsquo;s spirit requires a host body before it can communicate. While possessing a humanoid, it uses that host to share the following secrets, doing so in the course of a brief conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The heart of the mountain is sealed behind doors of black basalt that only a dwarf king can unlock. In the mountain&rsquo;s heart, you&rsquo;ll find your own greatness.&rdquo; (See <strong>area area 15</strong>.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;When you enter a room, speak the word &lsquo;xunderbrok&rsquo; for all to hear. You might be rewarded.&rdquo; (Characters who understand Dwarvish know that the word means &ldquo;secret trove.")</li>
<li>&ldquo;Demons invaded our temple, but we trapped them in statues on this level. Beware them.&rdquo; (See <strong>area area 29d</strong>.)</li>

The room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quartz Pillars</strong>. Glowing quartz pillars stand in the corners of the room.</p>
<p><strong>Duergar</strong>. Two duergar are inspecting a stone arch embedded in the center of the east wall.</p>
<p><strong>Instruments</strong>. Protruding from the south wall is an organ whose pipes are carved out of stalagmites. Its bench and keys are made of polished gold and black marble. Two large copper kettle drums stand against the west wall. Resting atop them is a shiny brass tuba.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The duergar have taken a break from looting to inspect the arch in the east wall. They turn <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> if they detect other creatures approaching, then move up behind the pillars to the north to take stock of the new arrivals. Then they sneak off to <strong>area area 15a</strong> to alert the duergar there. They avoid confrontation in this room.

<p>Any character who examines the room and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check realizes that some sort of magical conflagration caused the damage, and that it started in the middle of the room. There is nothing to indicate what triggered the devastation.</p>

<p><strong>Corpses</strong>. The corpses of two duergar (one male, one female) lie sprawled in the center of the room.</p>
<p><strong>Arch Gates</strong>. Two stone arches are embedded in the walls, one to the north and the other to the south.</p>
<p><strong>Stalkers</strong>. Halaster placed two Invisible Stalker here. They attack any creature that approaches within 10 feet of either gate or that emerges from a gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The male duergar was killed first by the invisible stalkers. His companion came looking for him minutes later and met the same fate. Both duergar wear dull gray scale armor. Their iron shields, war picks, and javelins lie nearby. They have no treasure.</p>

<li>The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature stands within 5 feet of the arch and either sings a D note or plays a D note on a musical instrument.</li>
