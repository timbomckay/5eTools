<p>Dweomercore is an academy of magic designed to test, trap, and confound its students. The level is designed for four 10th-level characters, and characters who defeat its monsters and villains should gain enough XP to reach 11th level.</p>

The arcanaloth keeps its true name secret and uses <wc-fetch type=spell>alter self</wc-fetch> spells to appear as Halaster.</p>
<p>The arcanaloth employs nycaloths and mezzoloths as guards, and it trades safe passage through Dweomercore for magic items or for assistance in dealing with an escaped devil (see &ldquo;<strong>area Bone Devil</strong>"). It also tries to tempt adventurers who are arcane spellcasters into joining its academyâ€”with free tuition!</p>

She strikes foul bargains, offering spells and secrets of magic in exchange for evil acts that allow her to claim souls.</p>
<p>The night hag wears a mummified kitten&rsquo;s head around her neck as a talisman, though it has no magical properties. It testifies to her fear of cats, for Wormriddle is <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch> while there&rsquo;s a feline creature within 30 feet of her that she can see or hear. The night hag also carries a lustrous black gem and a large black sackâ€”her <em>heartstone</em> and her <em>soul bag</em>, respectively (see the &ldquo;Hags&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual).</p>

Encounters with them can occur anywhere at any time, though they appear most often in their favorite haunts.</p>
<h4 id=spite-harrowdale>
<a href=#spite-harrowdale class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Spite Harrowdale</h4><p>Dweomercore&rsquo;s most apt pupil, Spite Harrowdale, is a centuries-old wizard (NE male Rashemi human archmage who speaks Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Giant). He appears to be a 12-year-old boy, thanks to imbibing <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Longevity</wc-fetch>. Spite hides the true measure of his magical talent by pretending to know only cantrips and 1st-level spells. This ruse has fooled the other students and most of his instructors, but not the arcanaloth, who is keeping a watchful eye on the wizard. Spite is the only student so far who has discerned that the headmaster is not in fact Halaster, but an arcanaloth disguised as him.</p>
<p>Spite has an oni companion that assumes the form of a female half-ogre named Dumara. The oni&rsquo;s real name is Kumar, and it has been in Spite&rsquo;s company most of its life. It treats Spite like an older brother, and it&rsquo;s the only being in whom Spite confides.</p>
<p>Spite wants to get his hands on a spellbook hidden in Halaster&rsquo;s private sanctuary (<strong>area area 45b</strong>), and he&rsquo;ll use any kind of distraction to get it. Spite cuts a deal with the adventurers: if they distract the arcanaloth and the night hag long enough for him to steal the spellbook, Spite will show them the stairs leading down to level 10 (see <strong>area area 44</strong>). He will also tell them an Undermountain secret, determined by drawing a random card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C). Spite upholds his end of the deal only as long as it&rsquo;s to his benefit, and he tries to pin the theft of the spellbook on the adventurers once they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>If the characters turn down Spite&rsquo;s deal, he teams up with Nylas Jowd and Skrianna Shadowdusk (see below) to destroy them.</p>
<h4 id=cephalossk-the-mind-flayer>
<a href=#cephalossk-the-mind-flayer class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Cephalossk the Mind Flayer</h4><p>Cephalossk is a solitary mind flayer arcanist (see the sidebar in the &ldquo;Mind Flayer&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual). It is a pariah among its own kind, has no allies at the academy, and isn&rsquo;t looking for friendship from anyone. It shadows adventurers and casts <wc-fetch type=spell>detect thoughts</wc-fetch> spells on them to glean their true intentions.</p>
<p>The mind flayer considers itself intellectually superior to everyone else, and it loathes Spite Harrowdale for being Halaster&rsquo;s favored pupil. Cephalossk tries to convince the characters to distract and kill Dumara (Spite&rsquo;s oni bodyguard) while it devours Spite&rsquo;s brain. In exchange for their help, Cephalossk promises to tell them &ldquo;three secrets that every Undermountain explorer should know.&rdquo; Once it has fed on Spite&rsquo;s brain, Cephalossk makes good on its promise and telepathically shares the following information with the characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mind flayer colony has taken over a level of Undermountain known as Seadeeps. (Cephalossk knows this because it has been in telepathic contact with the ulitharid on level 17.)</li>
<li>Githyanki have invaded Undermountain and are trying to exterminate the mind flayer colony in Seadeeps.</li>
<li>Halaster has commandeered a vessel that can travel between worlds through space and hidden it somewhere in Undermountain (see level 19).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters refuse to assist Cephalossk, the mind flayer attacks them.</p>

Each tube is 3 inches in diameter, and each canister is 9 inches long and just shy of 3 inches wide, with a screw-on copper lid. The tubes are labeled with their destinations.</p>
<p>Many of the level&rsquo;s inhabitants use these tubes to send scrolls, assignments, and missives to one another. Any object or creature able to fit in a tube (including characters in gaseous form) can be transported from one end to the other in a matter of seconds. If timing becomes important, assume that whatever a creature inserts into a tube on its turn arrives at the destination at the start of that creature&rsquo;s next turn.</p>

Nylas journeyed from Thay to study under Halaster and learn the deeper secrets of necromancy, and he has all the hallmarks of a Red Wizard of Thayâ€”namely, the red robes, the bald head, and the evil bent. He treats others as soon-to-be corpses and is more interested in their anatomy than what they say or do.</p>
<p>Nylas wants to turn the Horned Sisters (see below) into zombies because they have acted cruelly toward him. He asks the characters to kill them so he can raise their corpses with <wc-fetch type=spell>animate dead</wc-fetch> spells. If the characters refuse, Nylas and his will-o'-wisps attack them.</p>

She is one of the Shadowdusk family (see level 22) and is spoiling for a challenge. Rude, stuck-up, and privileged, Skrianna shows utter disdain for &ldquo;common rabble&rdquo; and takes sadistic pleasure in abusing and manipulating others with her magic. She is accompanied at all times by her shield guardian bodyguard (she wears its amulet), as well as a grell valet that carries her spellbook (which contains all the spells she has prepared).</p>
<p>Skrianna doesn&rsquo;t trust new arrivals and attacks them at the slightest provocation, trusting that her bodyguard and her valet will protect her if a fight breaks out.</p>

They served aboard pirate ships for a few years before ending up in Skullport, where they heard rumors of a secret academy for magic-users deep inside Undermountain. They fought tooth and nail to reach Dweomercore, but the place hasn&rsquo;t lived up to the hype. They have no friends at the academy, and they&rsquo;re unhappy with the quality of the instruction they&rsquo;ve received. Now they want to leave, but the headmaster has instructed them to remain while giving them assurances that things will change for the better. Wormriddle the night hag has been keeping an eye on the sisters, who take advantage of any distraction to flee back to Skullport. They will attempt to enlist the characters to cause such a distraction.</p>
<p>The sisters are tiefling Mage, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sisters are lawful evil.</li>
<li>Each sister has these racial traits: She has resistance to fire damage. She has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet. She speaks Common, Draconic, Infernal, and Undercommon.</li>
<li>Each sister carries a spellbook that contains all the spells she has prepared.</li>

He hopes to learn enough magic to one day conquer Skullport for his family. Like most drow, he is predictably treacherous. His silken words are pleasant enough, but any alliance forged with him is doomed to end badlyâ€”and most likely in bloodshed.</p>
<p>Elan extends the false hand of friendship to new arrivals while warning them to steer clear of the other students and the headmaster. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all insane,&rdquo; he says. He likes to hang around where the action is, so he can quietly observe where the characters keep their magic items and spellbooks (which he fully intends on claiming once they&rsquo;re dead).</p>

Left Hand of Manshoon</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Alarm</strong>. An <wc-fetch type=spell>alarm</wc-fetch> spell has been cast on the 20-foot-square area marked on map 9. It silently informs the headmaster in area 15 when visitors arrive.</p>
<p><strong>Ceiling Mosaics</strong>. This room has a 30-foot-high arched ceiling. Bright mosaics on the arched roof depict wizards engaged in dazzling spell duels.</p>
<p><strong>Undead Guardian</strong>. Floating in the middle of the room, 15 feet above the floor, is a man&rsquo;s withered left hand and forearm, severed at the elbow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Responding to the <wc-fetch type=spell>alarm</wc-fetch> spell, the arcanaloth makes its way toward area 1 to greet the new arrivals (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Meeting the Headmaster</strong>&rdquo; sidebar).</p>
<p>The limb belonged to a human archmage named Manshoonâ€”or, more precisely, to one of his clones. The clone challenged Halaster to a spell duel and lost more than just the contest. Halaster turned the limb into a guardian that attacks all intruders until the Mad Mage or a creature that looks like him waves it off. The limb has the statistics of an archmage, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a Tiny, unaligned undead with 63 (<wc-roll>18d4 + 18</wc-roll>) hit points and <wc-fetch type=spell>blight</wc-fetch> prepared instead of <wc-fetch type=spell>banishment</wc-fetch>.</li>
<li>It has a flying speed of 30 feet, and it can hover.</li>
<li>It has <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet and is blind beyond this radius. It can&rsquo;t speak or hear, and it can&rsquo;t be <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=condition>deafened</wc-fetch>.</li>

When in the company of visitors, the erudite arcanaloth tries to remain civil even while impersonating the Mad Mage. It describes the academy in glowing terms and sings the praises of its excellent students and their devotion to arcane magic. It claims to have a vested interest in all that happens inside Undermountain and bears no ill will toward adventurers who provide &ldquo;a much needed sanitary service&rdquo; by ridding the dungeon of pesky monsters. If the characters are just passing through on their way to the lower levels, the headmaster offers to take them to the top of the stairs leading down to level 10. For safe passage through Dweomercore, it requires one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A payment of one magic item per party member</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slaying the bone devil in <strong>area area 47</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters choose to deal with the bone devil rather than give up their magic items, the headmaster leads them south through <strong>area areas 2</strong>, <strong>area 3</strong>, <strong>area 6</strong>, <strong>area 38</strong>, <strong>area 39</strong>, and <strong>area 46</strong>. It waits for them in area <strong>area 46b</strong> while they slay the devil in <strong>area area 47</strong>, then escorts them to the top of the stairs leading down to level 10 as promised. After watching them disappear down the stairs, the arcanaloth returns to <strong>area area 15</strong>.</p>
<p>Visitors who decline the headmaster&rsquo;s offer are politely asked to return whence they came and never show their faces in Dweomercore again. Those who refuse to leave are attacked.</p>
<p>Any character who claims to be an arcane spellcaster in search of tutelage is invited to stay in Dweomercore and take the entrance exam. If the character accepts the offer, the headmaster uses a teleport spell to transport itself and the candidate to <strong>area area 11c</strong>, where it suggests the character remain until the entrance exam can be scheduled. (If the party includes multiple candidates, the arcanaloth keeps them together.) In truth, the arcanaloth expects the candidate to ignore its suggestion and explore the complex further. The entrance exam is actually about how the candidate deals with the other students. Any candidate who can hold their own against the other students is granted admittance, having passed the headmaster&rsquo;s &ldquo;exam&rdquo; in so doing.</p>
<p>A character admitted to Dweomercore is free to wander the halls and talk to other students, until such time as that character gets into trouble and is expelled or murdered.</p>

Trapped Hall</h3><p>The recessed wall of this corridor has engravings of eight wizards clutching staffs, each staff representing a different school of magic. This hall also has two hidden features:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a creature enters the trapped 10-foot-square space marked on map 9 for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the medusa statue in <strong>area area 3</strong> animates and shoots a magic arrow at the creature. (If the headmaster is accompanying characters through this hall, the arcanaloth uses a <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> cantrip to press the button and deactivate the trap.)</li>
<li>A stone button is concealed in the north wall, disguised to look like a section of the staff that represents conjuration. A character who searches the wall spots the button with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Pressing the button results in a loud clicking noise as the arrow trap deactivates for 1 minute.</li>

Medusa Junction</h3><p>The walls of this room rise vertically 10 feet, then angle inward to a 20-foot-high apex. In the middle of the room, standing atop a 1-foot-high cylindrical block of stone, is a statue of a scowling medusa with a longbow and an empty quiver. The statue gazes north.</p>
<p>When a creature sets off the trap in <strong>area area 2</strong>, a <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> arrow materializes in the medusa&rsquo;s grasp as the statue animates. It immediately draws back on the bow and shoots the arrow at the creature that triggered the trap (+6 to hit), dealing 6 (<wc-roll>1d8 + 2</wc-roll>) piercing damage plus 14 (<wc-roll>4d6</wc-roll>) poison damage on a hit.</p>
<p>The medusa statue is a Medium object with AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage. It weighs 1,200 pounds. A creature can use an action to try to knock the statue off its base, doing so with a successful DC 18 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. If it is toppled, the statue does not animate until returned to its former position. (If Wormriddle learns about the toppled statue, she and her flesh golems set it right before seeking to punish those responsible.)</p>

Fresh Water Fountain</h3><p><strong>Fountain</strong>. Fresh water from a natural spring pours out of the mouth of a bas-relief carved to look like Halaster&rsquo;s overjoyed visage, whereupon it spills into a semicircular stone basin enclosed by a 2-foot-high retaining wall before draining out through tiny holes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guards}. Flanking the fountain are two <strong>{@creature Mezzoloth||mezzoloths</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Braziers</strong>. Two unlit stone braziers shaped like clawed hands rise from the floor at the south end of the room.</p>

<p>The mezzoloths ensure that no one tampers with the academy&rsquo;s water supply or destroys the fountain. They otherwise pay visitors no mind.</p>

Portrait of a Mad Mage</h3><p>This room is empty except for an enormous red velvet curtain that covers the north wall. A pull-rope on one side of the curtain allows it to be drawn back. Behind the curtain hangs a large abstract painting that depicts Halaster surrounded by fields of bloody mouths and people feasting on each other. Worked into the background are various other bizarre figures from beyond the Material Plane. Halaster&rsquo;s face is chillingly calm despite the violent chaos around him, and his piercing gaze seems to follow anyone who views the portrait.</p>
<p>Any creature that beholds the painting must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer a random form of long-term madness, determined by rolling on the Long-Term Madness table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. On a failed save, a creature can be affected by the painting again, but not until its current madness ends.</p>

<p><strong>Desks</strong>. In the middle of the room stands a row of desks. Seated behind one of the desks is Spite Harrowdale (NE male Rashemi human archmage who speaks Abyssal, Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, and Primordial). His oni bodyguard, disguised as a half-ogre named Dumara, stands beside him.</p>
<p><strong>Bookshelves</strong>. Tall bookshelves packed with soft-covered notebooks line the northeast and southwest walls. The books are organized by topic.</p>
<p><strong>Pneumatic Tubes</strong>. A row of ten pneumatic tubes is fastened to the back wall. Beneath the tubes is a shelf of empty copper canisters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spite is holding a wand with a <wc-fetch type=spell>light</wc-fetch> cantrip cast on the end of it and reading a bone-dry biography of Ahghairon, the archwizard who founded Waterdeep. If the characters are being led through Dweomercore by the headmaster, Spite smiles at them as they pass by. Once they&rsquo;re gone, he and the oni cast <wc-fetch type=spell>invisibility</wc-fetch> on themselves and follow the characters, curious to learn their intentions in Dweomercore. Spite and Dumara confront the characters as soon as they can do so privately (see &ldquo;<strong>area Evil Students</strong>").</p>
<p>The notebooks stored here are small and thin enough that they can be curled up and stuffed in pneumatic tube canisters. The books cover subjects of interest to wizards, including spell component harvesting, ruminations on the Weave, biographies of famous wizards and liches, tips for creating realistic illusions, and essays written by previous students on a wide range of arcane topics. Any book in this collection that is removed from Dweomercore magically disappears and reappears back on its proper shelf.</p>

(If a room is vacant, its key is in the lock; otherwise, a room&rsquo;s key is in the possession of the room&rsquo;s resident.)</p>
<p><strong>Desk</strong>.

Where&rsquo;s Halaster?</h3><p>This room is empty except for an enormous red velvet curtain that covers the northwest wall. A pull-rope on one side of the curtain allows it to be drawn back. Hanging on the wall behind the curtain are fifteen paintings, each one 5 feet long and 3 feet tall, arranged in three rows of five.</p>
<p>Each painting depicts a graduating class of dour-faced Dweomercore wizards. Most of the older paintings show the students as skeletonsâ€”signifying which graduating students have died. Careful examination reveals that Halaster appears in every class picture except the center portrait in the middle row. Removing that painting from the wall triggers an elder rune hidden behind it (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>"). Determine the rune with a random draw from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B).</p>

<p><strong>Familiar</strong>. Elan&rsquo;s familiar, a black spider with blood-red markings, clings to the wall above the door and telepathically alerts the drow mage if it detects intruders in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine</strong>. A small shrine dedicated to the demon queen Lolth rests atop a nightstand by the bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After being alerted to the arrival of visitors by his spider familiar, Elan spends 3 rounds traveling from <strong>area area 13a</strong> to his dormitory. Elan greets strangers in a friendly manner (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elan Tanor&rsquo;thal</strong>").</p>
<p>The shrine almost resembles a lantern, designed to be easily transportable. Contained inside is a black basalt statuette of Lolth in her drow form, strung with cobwebs. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of enchantment magic around the statuette. Any creature that touches the statuette must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer a random form of short-term madness, determined by rolling on the Short-Term Madness table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. A creature that successfully saves against the madness effect can safely hold the statuette.</p>

<p><strong>Symbol</strong>. Inscribed on the floor and covered with a circular rug sewn with repeating eye-like patterns is a nearly <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>, 10-foot-diameter glyph that serves as the trigger for a <wc-fetch type=spell>symbol</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any creature that is not a fiend triggers the <wc-fetch type=spell>symbol</wc-fetch> spell when it steps on the circular rug or disturbs the rug in any way. Because the rug covers the spell&rsquo;s triggering glyph, the characters have little chance of spotting the glyph unless they use a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or magic that allows them to see through the rug.</p>
<p>When the glyph triggers, all creatures in this room and area 15a must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (<wc-roll>10d10</wc-roll>) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

Most of the books cover mundane subjects such as etiquette, oratory, and poetry. Twenty of the books are treatises on the Outer Planes and chronicles of historical events on various Material Plane worlds, including Toril, Oerth, Athas, and others; these tomes are worth 100 gp each to an interested buyer. A character who spends 1 hour searching can find one of these rare tomes.</p>
<p>The arcanaloth keeps its spellbook here. The book has leather covers with dreadful images branded into them. The script in the book is <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and can be read only by a creature who has <wc-fetch type=sense>truesight</wc-fetch> or by means of the <wc-fetch type=spell>see invisibility</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.

</blockquote>
<p>Nylas plans to ambush and kill Turbulence (see <strong>area area 17</strong>) when she enters the hall to drink from the cauldron. If the characters catch Nylas here, he tries to convince them to kill Turbulence for him and attacks them if they refuse.

Spellcasting Hall</h3><p>This room has a vaulted ceiling 30 feet high. It is lit by <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast on stone wall sconces shaped like fiendish claws. The walls, floor, and ceiling are scorched and pitted from spell damage.</p>
<p>If the characters are visiting the room for the first time, a black-robed female tiefling mage named Turbulence (see &ldquo;<strong>area The Horned Sisters</strong>") is engaged in a spell duel with three archmages, one of whom appears to be Halaster. Turbulence is losing badly and has only 3 hit points remaining. Before the archmages can finish her off, the tiefling shouts, &ldquo;I surrender!&rdquo; On their next turns, the archmages retreat into alcoves and become inanimate gray statues (see &ldquo;Statues&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>Turbulence tells the characters whatever they want to know about Dweomercore, with the intent of pitting them against Halaster. She mentions that the Mad Mage has a private sanctuary on this level (<strong>area area 45</strong>), hoping they&rsquo;ll try to rob it and create a big enough distraction for her and her sister Violence to escape.</p>

They are used for testing the spellcasting abilities of pupils. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around each one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>East Statue</strong>. This statue depicts a young Shou woman whose face is half ruined by acid. She clutches an orb in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>South Statue</strong>. This statue stands atop a stone dais and depicts Halaster Blackcloak in a robe covered with unblinking eyes. He clutches a staff.</p>
<p><strong>West Statue</strong>. This statue depicts a long-haired woman armed with a gnarled wand. She looks out from behind a smooth, featureless mask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statues are indestructible in their inanimate state. When a creature moves between the west and east statues, all three become flesh and attack all other creatures in the room. Roll initiative for each statue separately. While animated, the statues are Archmage, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The statues are unaligned constructs that speak only when casting spells that have verbal components. They can&rsquo;t leave the room.</li>
<li>They have the <wc-fetch type=spell>ice storm</wc-fetch> spell prepared instead of <wc-fetch type=spell>banishment</wc-fetch>, and the <wc-fetch type=spell>finger of death</wc-fetch> spell prepared instead of <wc-fetch type=spell>teleport</wc-fetch>.</li>
<li>If <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> or reduced to 0 hit points, a statue instantly teleports to its alcove, where it reverts to its inanimate form and regains all its hit points. It can&rsquo;t reanimate again until all three archmages have reverted to statues.</li>
<li>The statues return to their alcoves, revert to their inanimate forms, and regain all their hit points if, when their turn comes up, no other creatures remain in the room that aren&rsquo;t <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>. This also happens if a creature in the room speaks the words &ldquo;I surrender!&rdquo; in any language.</li>
<li>Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by an animated statue is stable and <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time the adventurers defeat a particular animated archmage statue, they receive XP for it as with any creature defeated in combat. Subsequent victories against that statue don&rsquo;t provide more XP, however.</p>

<p><strong>Trophy Case</strong>. Between the doors leading to area 20 stands an empty wooden trophy case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The apparition is a regional effect created by the Mad Mage (see &ldquo;<strong>area Halaster&rsquo;s Lair</strong>").

<p><strong>Benches</strong>. The northern half of the room contains raised stone benches for students.</p>
<p><strong>Dais</strong>. To the south, a large chalkboard is mounted above a 5-foot-high stone dais. Drawn on the chalkboard are three frog-like bipeds with wide, toothy smiles. They are arranged in a triangular formation; the top one is drawn in red chalk, the bottom left in blue, and the bottom right in green.</p>
<p><strong>Gurneys</strong>. Two stone gurneys are parked in the room. Strapped to one table is the corpse of a quaggoth, its chest burst open and entrails consumed. The other table, draped in a floor-length black sheet, has a slaad tadpole hidden under it (see &ldquo;Slaad Tadpole&rdquo; below).</p>

<p>Any character who studies the chalkboard drawings and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check recognizes them as a red, blue, and green slaad. Yellow chalk arrows point from the red slaad to the other two. Next to each slaad are words written in Abyssal. Any character who reads Abyssal can translate the words:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Parent&rdquo; is written next to the red slaad.</li>

<p>The cupboards contain nearly five hundred jars of ingredients used to brew common and uncommon magic potions, as well as other alchemical concoctions. Each jar is labeled in Abyssal. The ingredients are inert and not particularly valuable on their own.</p>

Wormriddle&rsquo;s Sanctum</h3><p>These chambers are claimed by Wormriddle the night hag (see &ldquo;<strong>area Wormriddle the Night Hag</strong>").

<p>The hag&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>plane shift</wc-fetch> spell doesn&rsquo;t work in Undermountain, but she can use her <em>heartstone</em> to escape to the Ethereal Plane if outmatched. The flesh golems in <strong>area area 23c</strong> form Wormriddle&rsquo;s first line of defense. If they&rsquo;re defeated, the hag seeks out the headmaster, who directs the hag to round up the students and form a posse to hunt down and destroy the interlopers.</p>

Smoke-Filled Hall</h4><p>This chamber is heavily obscured by smoke billowing out of two stone braziers. The night hag uses the smoke to deter students from entering her sanctum. The smoke blocks vision entirely, and creatures in the smoke are effectively <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch>. Each brazier bowl contains dozens of tiny holes through which the smoke seeps. Liquid poured into a brazier drains away quickly and does nothing to stop the billowing smoke.</p>
<p>Wormriddle fashioned tight-fitting iron lids for the braziers and keeps them in area 23b. If both braziers are properly covered, the smoke in the room begins to dissipate, making the area lightly obscured after 1 minute and clear after 5 minutes.</p>

Wormriddle&rsquo;s Den</h4><p>If Wormriddle the night hag is here and has been alerted to the presence of intruders, she assumes the form of a young halfling girl named Medley. In this form, she wears a black witch&rsquo;s hat and sweeps the floor with a small twig broom. The hag&rsquo;s den has these features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bones</strong>. Cat bones cover the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Lids</strong>. Leaning against the north wall are a pair of 25-pound, circular iron lids (covers for the braziers in <strong>area area 23a</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Bed</strong>. Mummified cats hang from a decrepit four-poster bed near the south wall. (Tucked under a moldy pillow is a jar filled with the night hag&rsquo;s dirty toenail clippings, which the hag uses to weave evil magic.)</p>
<p><strong>Dolls</strong>. Behind the bed, mounted to the wall, is a shelf lined with eight dolls. A ninth doll has fallen off the shelf and onto the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her halfling form, Wormriddle claims to be one of Dweomercore&rsquo;s most promising students and offers to take characters on a tour. If the characters accept, she leads them to <strong>area area 23c</strong> and orders her golems to attack. If the golems have already been defeated, the hag weeps over their loss and turns ethereal to escape the party, only to return once she rounds up the students and forms a posse. If the characters attack her here, the night hag turns ethereal and flees.</p>

The eight on the shelf represent Spite, Cephalossk, Nylas, Skrianna, the Horned Sisters, Elan, and Karstis. The doll on the floor represents Yarek, the student recently killed by the bone devil in <strong>area area 48</strong>. Each doll incorporates bits of the student&rsquo;s hair or some other sample from its body (foul-smelling slime in the case of Cephalossk the mind flayer).</p>
<p>Embedded in the stuffed chest of each doll is one of the night hag&rsquo;s toenail clippings, signifying and enabling her secret power over the individual represented by the doll. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain that the way to rob this power is by replacing the hag&rsquo;s nail clipping with a piece of the character&rsquo;s own body. Doing so enables the character to use the effigy to visit harm upon the student it represents.</p>
<p>For a doll to function, both it and the creature it represents must be in Undermountain. A character who has placed a piece of themselves in a particular doll can use an action to mutilate the doll in one of the following ways to gain a desired result:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the doll&rsquo;s eyes are pierced with pins or needles, the student it represents is <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch> until the pins or needles are removed, or until a <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic is cast on that student.</li>
<li>If the doll is stabbed through the back with a knife or similar sharp instrument, the student it represents is <wc-fetch type=condition>paralyzed</wc-fetch> until the instrument is removed, or until a <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic is cast on that student.</li>
<li>If the doll is set on fire or torn apart, it is destroyed, and the student it represents must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the student is <wc-fetch type=condition>stunned</wc-fetch> for 1 minute. On a failed save, the student instantly drops to 0 hit points and is dying.</li>

Flesh Golem Workshop</h4><p>If Wormriddle the night hag is here, she&rsquo;s in her natural form, searching the room for a misplaced wooden coffer (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stench</strong>. The room smells like rotting meat.</p>
<p><strong>Golems</strong>. Unless the characters already encountered and destroyed them elsewhere, four Flesh Golem lie under stained white sheets atop wooden trestle tables in the middle of the room.</p>
<p><strong>Work Area</strong>. A fifth table surrounded by patches of dried blood is covered with saws, needles, spools of black thread, and bits of decaying flesh. Next to this table is a wooden barrel that holds humanoid body parts in various stages of decay.</p>
<p><strong>Hanging Corpses</strong>. Four mostly intact human corpses are hanging from hooks mounted to the south wall. (A secret door hidden behind one hanging corpse pulls open to reveal a tunnel leading to <strong>area area 25</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Pneumatic Tubes</strong>. Attached to the north wall is a row of thirteen copper pneumatic tubes. Empty copper canisters rest on a shelf under the tubes.</p>

School Meals</h3><p>The real Halaster has bound two barbed devils to these chambers and tasks them with preparing meals for Dweomercore&rsquo;s students and faculty.</p>
<p>Characters who examine the outermost doors (each marked with an asterisk on the map) notice thin silver tracery and glyphs around the exterior door frames. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check reveals that the glyphs around each door prevent devils from passing through the doorway. Scratching away any of the glyphs breaks the magic on that door, enabling devils to pass through it normally.</p>

Kitchen</h4><p>The kitchen is tidy and filled with spicy aromas and the smell of charred food. It contains all the furnishings and accoutrements of a typical kitchen, such as food preparation tables, cupboards stuffed with pots and pans, and racks of utensils. Its more noteworthy features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kitchen Staff</strong>. Two Barbed Devil prepare meals here and attack anyone they don&rsquo;t recognize. Also present are three Living Unseen Servant (see appendix A) that deliver meals.</p>
<p><strong>Stove</strong>. The kitchen&rsquo;s centerpiece, a massive iron stove with a domed hood, is topped with bubbling cauldrons and sizzling skillets.</p>
<p><strong>Pneumatic Tubes</strong>. Thirteen copper pneumatic tubes are fastened to one wall, with a shelf of empty copper canisters below them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The devils perform their duties in a half-hearted manner, usually undercooking or overcooking the food. Despite their displeasure, they keep the kitchen clean and tidy, as befits their orderly nature. The living unseen servants have no function other than to deliver meals.</p>
<p>The stove is powered by magic from the Elemental Plane of Fire and puts out a lot of heat. Any creature that touches the stove or starts its turn in contact with it takes 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) fire damage.</p>

If she has not been encountered elsewhere, Violence the tiefling mage (see &ldquo;<strong>area The Horned Sisters</strong>") is here, cleaning dishes as punishment for threatening a guest lecturer.</p>
<p>Violence isn&rsquo;t permitted to leave until the headmaster releases her, and she&rsquo;s unwilling to sneak off and face greater punishment. If the characters approach her in a friendly manner, Violence recommends that they speak to her sister, who is in the Spellcasting Hall (<strong>area area 17</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Bookshelves</strong>. Carved into the walls are five-tiered bookshelves packed with old leather-bound tomes.</p>
<p><strong>Illusory Frescoes</strong>. At the north end of the east wall is a 20-foot wide, 8-foot-tall painted fresco. A similar fresco adorns the middle of the west wall. These walls and their frescoes are illusions that conceal passages to <strong>area areas 28</strong> and <strong>area 32</strong>. Hidden behind the illusory wall to the west are four altered helmed horrors (each marked with an H on map 9).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of the books stored here are valuable, and many are so old that they fall apart if opened. Most are textbooks about the eight schools of arcane magic, penned by sages and scholars of yore, and they contain handwritten margin notes and graffiti from previous owners.</p>
<p>The fresco on the east wall depicts a wizard&rsquo;s tower floating above a city being pulverized by meteor swarms. The fresco on the west wall depicts Halaster riding triumphantly on the back of a blue dracolich. The walls and their frescoes are illusions without substance. Creatures can pass right through them, and an illusory wall can be dispelled with a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 14).</p>

<p><strong>Servants</strong>. Six Living Unseen Servant (see appendix A) stand invisibly about the room.</p>
<p><strong>Dining Set</strong>. A 20-foot-long, 5-foot-wide stone table laid out with dinnerware has twelve tall wooden chairs around it.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong>. Suspended above the table are two lanterns with <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast on them.</p>
<p><strong>Tapestry</strong>. An old, threadbare tapestry spanning the north wall depicts seven wizardly figures standing in a row. (A passage leading to <strong>area area 31</strong> is concealed by this tapestry.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unseen servants' job is to serve meals and tidy up afterward. They bring food from the bone devils in the kitchen (<strong>area area 27a</strong>) whenever someone sits down at the table. These servants do not attack and are worth 0 XP.</p>
<p>The figures portrayed on the tapestry are Halaster&rsquo;s first seven apprentices: three robed women (Arcturia, Jhesiyra Kestellharp, and Marambra Nyghtsteel), three robed men (Nester, Rantantar, and Trobriand), and an armored male human (Muiral) in the middle. Each figure&rsquo;s name is stitched into the tapestry below it. Any character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check recognizes these figures as the Seven.</p>
<p>If it is set on fire, the burning tapestry produces toxic green smoke that coalesces into an efreeti and attacks all creatures in the room. The efreeti remains in the room thereafter, until set free by Halaster.</p>

Halaster&rsquo;s Secretary</h3><p>A nothic is chained to the floor of this otherwise empty room. The nothic&rsquo;s chain is short enough to prevent the creature from reaching the doors but long enough to let it attack anything that enters the room. The chain can be broken with a strike from a magic weapon or an adamantine weapon, or with a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>Strapped to the nothic&rsquo;s head is a crystal helmet-like contraption with leather straps, copper coils, and flashing glass diodes attached to it that emits buzzing noises. Halaster cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>geas</wc-fetch> spell on the nothic to prevent it from removing the helmet.</p>
<p>While the nothic wears its bizarre helmet, all <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spells that would normally be received by Halaster Blackcloak are instead received by the nothic (see &ldquo;<strong>area Sending Spells</strong>"). Any other creature that dons the helmet becomes the new recipient of these messages. Halaster gets an average of one <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spell message per hour. Most of the messages are from desperate, deranged mages inquiring about apprenticeships. Vulgar taunts from adventurers are also common.</p>

Illusion Classroom</h3><p>Powerful illusion magic has turned this unlit, 20-foot-high room into the courtyard of a Waterdavian villa lit by the warm midday sun. It has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Decor</strong>. White marble benches encircle a central fountain with a trident-wielding sahuagin statue as its centerpiece.</p>
<p><strong>Flora and Fauna</strong>. Ivy creeps up the walls, and birds flutter about as they perch on the trickling fountain&rsquo;s stony protrusions.</p>
<p><strong>Tiefling</strong>. Standing next to the fountain is a male tiefling wizard with long horns and golden robes. (This figure, like its surroundings, is illusory.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tiefling introduces itself as Professor Figment and invites new arrivals to sit on the benches and make themselves comfortable. It then begins to tell lengthy stories about famous illusionists and their art, in a rather exhaustive and encyclopedic manner. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 17) cast on Professor Figment ends the illusion. The first creature that tries to dispel the illusion of Professor Figment and fails is targeted by a <wc-fetch type=spell>phantasmal killer</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 22) as the tiefling instructor briefly and vividly transforms into the target&rsquo;s worst nightmare; then it calmly continues with &ldquo;Now, where was I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The illusory objects and wildlife seem real to the senses. The illusion of the villa, the fountain, the sunlight, and the wildlife can be ended with a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 19).

Rather than follow the prescribed method, he devised his own technique and botched the ritual spells. Consequently, his phylactery was shattered, and his body and mind have slowly crumbled away. The floating skull and hanging skeletal arms are all that remain of him; they move like they&rsquo;re attached to an <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> body.</p>
<p>Nester educates Dweomercore&rsquo;s pupils in the art of necromancy, but his knowledge has become fragmented, and his mind tends to wander. He assumes the adventurers are students sent to learn the darkest of the magical arts and begins telepathically lecturing them about zombies, often repeating himself. He attacks anyone who tries to leave the lecture before its conclusion.</p>
<p>Nester is an archmage, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nester is undead and chaotic evil.</li>
<li>He understands Auran, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Giant, and Terran, but can&rsquo;t speak. (He uses <wc-fetch type=spell>Rary&rsquo;s telepathic bond</wc-fetch> to communicate.)</li>

Each <wc-fetch type=item>professor orb</wc-fetch> takes the form of a smooth, solid, 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=item>professor orb</wc-fetch> is sentient and has the personality of a scholar. Its alignment is determined by rolling on the alignment table in the &ldquo;Sentient Magic Items&rdquo; section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. Regardless of its disposition, the orb has an Intelligence of 18, and Wisdom and Charisma scores determined by rolling <wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll> for each ability. The orb speaks, reads, and understands four languages, and can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can&rsquo;t initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=item>professor orb</wc-fetch> has extensive knowledge of four narrow academic subjects. When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).</p>
<p>In addition to the knowledge it possesses, a <wc-fetch type=item>professor orb</wc-fetch> can cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>Skrianna Shadowdusk</strong>. The first time the characters enter this hall, they encounter Skrianna Shadowdusk, a female human mage (see &ldquo;<strong>area Skrianna Shadowdusk</strong>"). She is leaving the study hall (<strong>area area 39</strong>) and heading to her quarters (<strong>area area 11b</strong>), or vice versa. A <wc-fetch type=spell>light</wc-fetch> cantrip cast on the top of her staff lights her path. Skrianna&rsquo;s shield guardian marches a few steps behind her.

</blockquote>
<p>If the characters are being escorted through this hall by the headmaster, Skrianna tries to plow through their ranks to make the point that they, not she, must stand aside. If this leads to violence, the headmaster quells the conflict as quickly as possible and tells Skrianna that she is confined to her quarters. Once she is out of sight of the headmaster and the characters, she takes her spellbook and returns to her quarters as commanded, but not before ordering her grell valet to shadow the party, spy on their activities, and report back to her.</p>
<p>If the characters have no escort, Skrianna asks them, &ldquo;Who in the Nine Hells are you?&rdquo; If it&rsquo;s clear that the characters don&rsquo;t belong in Dweomercore, Skrianna attacks them from a safe distance while the shield guardian and the grell accost her attackers at close range.</p>

Spectral Skull</h4><p>The single door leading to this room opens inward, swinging toward the east. The room has a flat ceiling 20 feet high and contains the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Two 11-foot-tall statues of elephant-headed men stand in the southern corners. The one closer to the southern exit is a stone golem. The other statue is inanimate and harmless.</p>
<p><strong>Dais</strong>. An arched double door carved with screaming devil faces stands closed at the back of a dais. Floating in front of the double door is a giant, ghostly human skull with a long beard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The devil-faced doors have nine hidden locks, each of which requires a separate <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell to open. Both doors also swing open when one or the other is touched with a silvered weapon, or if someone speaks Infernal while standing on the dais.</p>
<p>The ghostly skull is neither a creature nor an object, but a magical force. It has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=sense>truesight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet, but it can&rsquo;t perceive any creature warded by a <wc-fetch type=spell>nondetection</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. The skull can&rsquo;t move or be moved from its space, and it can&rsquo;t be damaged. Because it&rsquo;s without substance, other creatures can occupy its space. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 19) cast on the skull causes it to vanish for 1 minute. The skull also disappears while contained in an antimagic field. No other magic has any effect on it.</p>
<p>If the skull sees any creature other than the real Halaster in the room, it screams, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not me!&rdquo; When this happens, all creatures in the vicinity must roll initiative, including the stone golem. The skull acts on initiative count 30 and again on initiative count 15. On each of the skull&rsquo;s turns, all creatures in the room except the stone golem are telekinetically thrust straight up into the air, then cast down hard onto the floor. Each target takes 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage and ends the turn <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> in its space. (Although the telekinesis effect is magical, the damage it deals is not.) Only when there are no more creatures left to toss about does the ghostly skull cease its assault.</p>
<p>When the ghostly skull screams, the golem uses its first turn in combat to block the south exit, pushing the door closed and shoving smaller creatures out of the way automatically. By occupying the space north of the door, the golem prevents the door from being opened. The golem remains stationary and attacks creatures within its reach, returning to its original position only when no other creatures are left in the room.</p>

<p><strong>Chair</strong>. Behind the desk, attached to a thin iron chain and draped over one corner of a tall black crystal chair, is a fist-sized, gleaming black gemstoneâ€”the control gem for the death slaad on level 8 (a <wc-fetch type=spell>legend lore</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic confirms as much).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The desk has a single drawer, in which Halaster has placed one of his many spellbooks. This thin tome has a black leather cover with Halaster&rsquo;s rune burned into it. Any creature other than Halaster that opens the book triggers an elder rune that targets that individual (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>"). Draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B) to determine which rune appears.</p>

Devil on the Loose</h3><p>A conjurer named Yarek summoned a bone devil in <strong>area area 48</strong> and promised to set it free on the condition that it kill his nemesis, Skrianna Shadowdusk. The bone devil agreed. After Yarek released the devil, it immediately murdered him. To fulfill its agreement with the mage, the devil must now kill Skrianna. Wards placed on these chambers prevent the devil from leaving, however, and the greater wards placed on Undermountain by Halaster prevent it from getting away by plane shifting.</p>
<p>Before he died, Yarek used a <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spell to warn the headmaster about the escaped devil. If the arcanaloth persuades the characters to destroy the devil in exchange for safe passage through Dweomercore, it waits patiently for them in <strong>area area 46b</strong> while they confront the fiend in these chambers.</p>

Alas, Poor Yarek</h4><p>Characters who examine the doors to this room (each marked with an asterisk on map 9) notice thin silver tracery and glyphs around the exterior door frames. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check reveals that the glyphs around each door prevent devils from passing through the doorway. Scratching away any of the glyphs breaks the magic on that door, allowing devils to pass through it normally.</p>
<p>This room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tapestry</strong>. A blood-spattered tapestry hanging on the west wall depicts scores of demons and devils locked in battle. (A secret door hidden behind the tapestry opens into <strong>area area 47c</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Yarek</strong>. A dead male human (Yarek) in bloody robes is sprawled on the floor in front of the tapestry.</p>
<p><strong>Illusory Wall</strong>. A 20-foot-wide section of the north wall is illusory, concealing <strong>area area 47b</strong> beyond. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an illusory wall for what it truly is. It has no substance, and creatures and objects can pass right through it. The illusory wall is destroyed by a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 14).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yarek dragged himself across the floor before he finally expired. The characters can follow Yarek&rsquo;s bloody trail through the illusory wall into <strong>area area 47b</strong>, where the devil mortally wounded him. A character who examines the corpse and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain that the mage was stabbed several times by a piercing weapon (the devil&rsquo;s hooked polearm) and has a deep, <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> wound in his chest (caused by the bone devil&rsquo;s stinger).

Dealing with the Bone Devil</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Devil</strong>. Beyond the illusory wall waits a bone devil armed with a hooked polearm (see the &ldquo;Variant: Bone Devil Polearm&rdquo; sidebar in the &ldquo;Devils&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual).</p>
<p><strong>Statue</strong>. A raised stone alcove contains a chipped and worn statue of a female drow riding a giant lizard. The tip of the lizard&rsquo;s tail has broken off and is missing. (The statue is inanimate and nonmagical.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bone devil is reluctant to take on a well-armed band of adventurers, since the outcome is likely to conflict with its goals of survival and escape. If the characters are willing to free it from the confines of these rooms by scratching away the silver glyphs that ward the exits, the devil pursues a mutually beneficial arrangement while exploiting a badly worded agreement to its advantage. Once it escapes, it tries to hunt down and kill Skrianna Shadowdusk, thus fulfilling a promise made to its late summoner. If the characters slay the devil, it transforms into a pool of stinking ichor, leaving its hooked polearm behind.</p>

Dweomercore&rsquo;s Vault</h4><p>Stacked against the south wall are seven iron chests that hold Dweomercore&rsquo;s operating funds (used to pay guest instructors, purchase school supplies, and so forth). The chests are currently empty, and Halaster hasn&rsquo;t had the time or inclination to replenish them.</p>

Conjuration Classroom</h3><p>A large pentagram is inscribed on the floor of this 20-foot-high domed chamber. A character who studies the pentagram and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain its properties. The check is made with advantage if the character is a wizard whose arcane tradition is the School of Conjuration.</p>
<p>Any magically summoned fiend that appears inside the pentagram is trapped there until its summoner releases it, until the fiend takes damage from an outside source, or until another creature enters the circle. Damaging the pentagram renders it powerless in addition to releasing any creature trapped inside it.</p>

Arch Gate to Level 14</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Arch</strong>. A stone arch embedded in the middle of the southeast wall has the image of an open book carved into its keystone.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. A secret door opens into a dusty tunnel leading east.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arch is one of Halaster&rsquo;s gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). Its rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holding an open book while standing within 5 feet of the arch causes the gate to open for 1 minute. The book turns to dust as the gate opens, even if it is a spellbook.</li>
<li>Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 25 on level 14</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>

The loss of one or more students has little effect on the day-to-day affairs of Dweomercore, since the faculty has no emotional attachment to the pupils. Within a tenday, the headmaster replaces dead students with new arrivals and begins their orientation.</p>
<p>Slaying the arcanaloth forces Wormriddle to step up and assume the mantle of headmaster, backed by her flesh golem guards. If the night hag is also slain, all the remaining students promptly turn on each other. Elan Tanor&rsquo;thal joins forces with Cephalossk to challenge Spite Harrowdale, Nylas Jowd tries to kill the Horned Sisters one by one, and Skrianna Shadowdusk waits to see how these conflicts play out before going after the survivors. Any students who remain standing gather what valuables they can from their fallen peers and flee Dweomercore.</p>
