<p>Halaster makes his home in the lowest level of Undermountain, which is optimized for four characters of 17th level or higher. Characters who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 20th level.</p>

He is ready to grant the characters an audience, having kept an eye on their progress. True to the nature that earned him the moniker &ldquo;Mad Mage,&rdquo; Halaster&rsquo;s demeanor toward the characters can change on a whim. He might alternate between seeming furious, baffled, annoyed, amusedâ€”or simply bored, depending on what the characters have accomplished before reaching this level. See appendix A for more information on the Mad Mage.</p>
<p>If the characters and their actions support Halaster&rsquo;s current goal (see &ldquo;<strong>area Halaster&rsquo;s Goals</strong>"), the Mad Mage is not necessarily hostile. For example, if his primary goal is to find an apprentice, Halaster has kept an eye on any arcane spellcasters in the party. He might suggest that those characters prove their worth by surviving the Mad Wizard&rsquo;s Lair and &ldquo;freeing up&rdquo; an apprenticeship by eliminating Arcturia or Trobriand. If this is done, Halaster is willing to take on an appropriate character as a new apprentice. Halaster has no sentimental attachment toward his apprentices, and he often enjoys secretly tormenting them.</p>
<h3 id=arcturia>
<a href=#arcturia class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Arcturia</h3><p>Arcturia is a lich and a master of transmutation magic. She has altered her form dramatically over the years, now appearing more alive than undead. Gossamer wings sprout from her shoulders, and bone spurs jut from her forearms and elbows.</p>
<p>If the characters destroyed her phylactery on <strong>area level 14</strong>, Arcturia attacks them on sight. She has no beef with them otherwise.</p>

Characters who have passed through the upper levels might have encountered some of his creations.</p>
<p>Fed up with the frailty of the flesh, Trobriand has transferred his spirit into the body of a specially prepared iron golem. This merging of spirit and metal has done nothing to improve his sanity, however.</p>

No tunnels or staircases connect this dungeon complex to the upper levels of Undermountain. Characters arrive in <strong>area area 1</strong> after passing through a gate in Shadowdusk Hold (<strong>area area 35 on level 22</strong>).</p>

No Retreat</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Arch</strong>. The north wall is set with a stone arch, its keystone bearing Halaster&rsquo;s visage whose animated eyes follow any creature that approaches the arch. Carved into the wall above the keystone is a sigil.</p>
<p><strong>Statue</strong>. An alcove to the south contains a life-size, painted stone statue of Halaster perched atop a 4-foot-tall granite plinth like a vulture, squatting with arms outstretched and fingers curled like talons, as though ready to leap down and claw at anyone who stands before it (see &ldquo;<strong>area Halaster Statue</strong>&rdquo; below).</p>
<p><strong>Frescoes</strong>. Six 10-foot-square painted frescoes adorn the walls around the arch: two flanking the arch on the north wall, two side by side on the west wall, and two side by side on the east wall. Each fresco displays a magically animated image of Halaster performing one or more mundane activities: stretching and yawning, juggling rods, sweeping the floor with a broom, trying to escape from a straitjacket, doing handstands, and shadowboxing.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. Hidden behind the fresco that depicts Halaster stretching and yawning is a secret door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Targeting an animated fresco with a <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell has no effect other than to cause Halaster&rsquo;s image to silently mock the spell&rsquo;s caster. The images become motionless while in the area of an antimagic field.</p>

Both it and the face carved into the keystone are harmless.</p>
<p>Halaster can open the gate for 1 minute by touching the arch. The gate cannot otherwise be opened from this side. A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 35 on level 22</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the gate located there.</p>
<h4 id=halaster-statue>
<a href=#halaster-statue class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Halaster Statue</h4><p>Anytime a creature other than Halaster tries to cast a spell in this room, the statue&rsquo;s arms animate and perform the quick series of somatic gestures needed to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>counterspell</wc-fetch>. After casting its spell, the statue reverts to its inanimate state until triggered again. The counterspell attempt succeeds automatically.</p>
<p>The statue is a Large object with AC 17, 50 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage. The statue falls to pieces and loses its spellcasting ability if it is reduced to 0 hit points. Destroying the statue triggers a <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell; the mouth appears amid the shattered remains and says, &ldquo;Is this the end of Halaster Blackcloak? Ha! I think not.&rdquo;</p>

Reversed Library</h3><p>Everything in this room is upside down because gravity in the room is magically reversed. The room is furnished thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bookshelves</strong>. The walls are lined with upside-down bookshelves, fully stocked with upside-down history books from the many parts of the world Halaster has explored.</p>
<p><strong>Desk</strong>. In the middle of the 15-foot-high ceiling is an upside-down desk topped with a stack of tomes held between two golden, upside-down bookends shaped like bulettes bursting out of the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reverse gravity field can&rsquo;t be negated, though it is suppressed within an antimagic field. Unless anchored, held down, or affected by a <wc-fetch type=spell>fly</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic, any creature or object that enters this room falls up toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>The desk is empty except for the array of nine books held between the bulette-shaped bookends. Eight of the books contain essays pertaining to the eight schools of magic, one book dedicated to each school. The cover and the pages of the ninth book appear blank.</p>
<p>Placing the other books in alphabetical order by school of magic between the bookends causes Halaster&rsquo;s rune to appear on the cover of the ninth book and spells to appear on its pages. This tome is one of Halaster&rsquo;s spellbooks (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<h4 id=treasure>

Talking Heads</h3><p>This 10-foot-high room has wooden shelves covering the walls from floor to ceiling. Hundreds of wide-mouthed jars line the shelves, each containing a severed head floating in brine.</p>
<p>The heads in the jars are specimens that Halaster has collected throughout Undermountain: goblins, drow, kuo-toa, duergar, troglodytes, githyanki, mind flayers, and other creatures. Although detached from their bodies, the heads remain alive and sedate as a result of Halaster&rsquo;s magic. Tapping on a jar is enough to stir a head to consciousness. The heads speak only the languages they knew in life and have no recollection of how they ended up in their disembodied state. A character can prompt a head for information, which it&rsquo;s happy to provide. Each head shares one Undermountain secret determined by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C). A head can also confirm that Halaster spends a lot of time on this level of Undermountain.</p>
<p>Removing a head from a jar or removing a jar from this room ends the magic that animates the head, which immediately dies.</p>

Magical Repository</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Ceiling</strong>. This room has a 30-foot-high vaulted ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Four statues, each one carved to look like a 20-foot-high purple worm bursting up through the floor, fill the corners of the room. (These statues are harmless.)</p>
<p><strong>Dome</strong>. A deep, 20-foot-high alcove in the north wall contains four Invisible Stalker trapped inside an invisible, dome-shaped wall of force rising from the floor. (Any items that Halaster removed from the mine carts in <strong>area level 15, area 1</strong>, lie on the floor inside the dome. The dome appears to contain nothing else.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dotted circle on map 23 marks the edge of the dome, which was created by a <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of force</wc-fetch> spell made permanent by Halaster. The dome can&rsquo;t be dispelled by <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch>, but a <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch> spell destroys it, freeing the invisible stalkers within.</p>
<p>The invisible stalkers attack any creature other than Halaster that enters the dome using magic (such as a <wc-fetch type=spell>dimension door</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=spell>misty step</wc-fetch> spell).

Lightning Pillars</h4><p>This two-chambered hall has a 20-foot-high ceiling supported by ten copper-plated pillars of iron. The pillars generate arcs of magic lightning, as well as bolts that leap from one pillar to another. Creatures standing outside the hall are safe, as are creatures within the 20-foot-square space marked on map 23. A creature that ends its turn in any other space in the hall is struck by lightning from the nearest pillar and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>A character who uses an action to study the pillars and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check notices a pattern in the lightning discharges and gains advantage on saving throws made against the pillars. In addition, the character identifies the safe space in the middle of the hall.</p>

The shield is cast in the form of a serene, angelic visage wreathed in bronze feathers.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the otherwise ordinary shield, inside which is trapped a pit fiend named Kastzanedes. Any ability that detects the presence of fiends, such as a paladin&rsquo;s Divine Sense class feature, reveals the presence of such a creature bound within the shield.</p>
<p>If an <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell is cast on the shield, or if it is brought within 10 feet of its sister shield in <strong>area area 9b</strong>, the pit fiend is released. It appears within 5 feet of the shield&rsquo;s bearer or in the nearest unoccupied space. The freed pit fiend attacks any other creatures it can see, targeting celestials above all others.</p>
<p>While trapped in the shield, the pit fiend can communicate telepathically with the shield&rsquo;s wielder. It pretends to be a sentient magic item that is unwilling to disclose its secrets, trying to goad the characters into casting <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> on it. If that tactic doesn&rsquo;t work, the pit fiend tries to talk the shield&rsquo;s wielder into undertaking a quest to find its sister shield. The pit fiend suspects that the other shield is nearby, but does not know its location.</p>

Teleportation Pillars</h3><p>Eight black marble pillars form a circle in this 20-foot-high room. Carved into each pillar is a symbol representing one of the eight schools of magic (Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation).</p>
<p>The first time a character enters the circle of pillars, a <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell activates on the floor and speaks the following riddle in Common before vanishing:</p>
<p>A crown festooned my dwarven brow.</p>
<p>I rest beneath the mountain now.</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>The answer is &ldquo;Melair,&rdquo; the dwarf king who is buried on level 6. The characters can use divination magic to determine the correct answer if they can&rsquo;t work it out.</p>
<p>Speaking Melair&rsquo;s name aloud while standing in the room causes the symbols on the pillars to glow bright colors. The symbols continue to glow for 1 minute. During that time, any creature that enters the area inside the pillars or starts its turn there is teleported to a similar location in <strong>area area 8</strong>, along with anything it is wearing or carrying.</p>

A fist-sized yellow sapphire is embedded in each of the five easternmost pillars at a height of 10 feet, such that all five gemstones face inward. Each of the remaining three pillars, in the west side of the room, bears an empty indentation where a similar gem is meant to be placed. The three missing gems can be found in <strong>area area 17</strong>.</p>
<p>When all eight yellow sapphires are placed in their pillars, they glow brightly as the pillars' magic activates. Any creature that enters the area inside the pillars or starts its turn there is teleported to a similar location in <strong>area area 7</strong>, along with anything it is wearing or carrying.</p>
<p>The sapphires can be pried from their fixtures, but removing even one of them deactivates the pillars.</p>

Diabolical Shield</h4><p>Hanging on the west wall of this otherwise empty 15-foot-high room is a steel shield cast in the form of a scowling devil&rsquo;s face wreathed by bronze flames.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the otherwise ordinary shield, inside which is trapped a deva named Aryx. While trapped in the shield, Aryx can&rsquo;t communicate with anyone. Any ability that detects the presence of celestials, such as a paladin&rsquo;s Divine Sense class feature, reveals the presence of such a creature bound within the shield. If a <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel evil and good</wc-fetch> spell is cast on the shield, or if the shield comes within 10 feet of a fiend, the deva is released, appearing within 5 feet of the shield or in the nearest unoccupied space. Once freed, the deva uses its <wc-fetch type=spell>detect evil and good</wc-fetch> spell to determine if there are any evil creatures in its presence. If so, Aryx attacks them, targeting fiends above all others.</p>
<p>Aryx was sent by Tyr, the god of justice, to talk some sense into Fazrian, the fallen planetar on level 21. Before Aryx could approach Fazrian, however, Halaster trapped the deva in the shield. Aryx must complete its mission before it can return to Tyr&rsquo;s heavenly realm. If the characters claim to have killed Fazrian or helped the planetar achieve atonement, the deva uses a <wc-fetch type=spell>commune</wc-fetch> spell to verify as much. If the characters speak the truth, Aryx shows its gratitude by granting each party member a <em>blessing of health</em> (see &ldquo;Supernatural Gifts&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). If the characters have not yet dealt with the fallen planetar on level 21, Aryx offers to fight alongside the party until such time as it can leave this level and complete its mission, provided the characters aren&rsquo;t predominantly evil. If the characters help Aryx defeat Fazrian later on, the deva shows its gratitude by bestowing upon them the <em>blessing of health</em>.</p>

Zigzagging Gallery</h4><p>Characters who make a loud racket in this hall attract the seven Flameskull in <strong>area area 10b</strong>. The features of this hall are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chandeliers</strong>. Radiant crystal chandeliers levitate near the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Paintings</strong>. Paintings line the walls. They come in many sizes and have gilded frames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hall contains three chandeliers, their locations marked on map 23. Each chandelier magically sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. A chandelier can bear up to 150 pounds of additional weight before falling. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on a chandelier causes it to go dark and fall to the floor with a loud crash.</p>
<p>The paintings are stuck to the walls with <wc-fetch type=item>sovereign glue</wc-fetch> and require <wc-fetch type=item>universal solvent</wc-fetch> to remove without destroying them. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of illusion magic around each painting, of which there are hundreds. Half of them are portraits of Halaster, looking as demented as ever in his <wc-fetch type=item>robe of eyes</wc-fetch>. About a quarter of them are portraits of other wizards (former apprentices). The remainder are paintings of unknown people with the heads of small beasts (badgers, mice, rabbits, birds, fish, and so forth). The paintings' eyes (including the eyes on Halaster&rsquo;s robes) seem to follow visitors as they move through the hallâ€”a minor magical illusion.</p>

<p><strong>Decor</strong>. More paintings like the ones in <strong>area area 10a</strong> line the walls. A golden shield encrusted with gemstones hangs on the south wall among the paintings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Halaster made the flameskulls from the skulls of wizards who tried and failed to become his apprentices. They attack intruders on sight, bombarding them with <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> spells in the first round of combat. The flameskulls pursue intruders that flee, using their <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> spells to open doors if needed.</p>
<p>Hanging on a stone peg that juts from the wall, the gold-plated shield is etched with arcane runes. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of necromancy magic radiating from the shield. A character who examines the runes and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain that the runes give the shield the magical ability to trap creatures inside it.</p>
<p>Any creature that touches the shield must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become trapped inside it, along with everything the creature is wearing or carrying. The shield displays a faint image of the trapped creature in its reflective outer surface. The shield can trap only one creature at a time. Whenever it traps a new creature, the shield releases its current prisoner, which appears in an unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.</p>
<p>A creature trapped in the shield can do nothing except attempt a DC 18 Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the creature is released and appears in an unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible. On a failed save, the creature takes 31 (<wc-roll>7d8</wc-roll>) necrotic damage.

<p>The body of a frail man in dark robes lies atop a stone slab near the south wall. The man has long, wavy hair and a thick beard the color of iron, and he wears a metal ring on the index finger of his left hand.</p>
<p>Characters who have seen images of Trobriand know that the body lying on the slab is his. After Trobriand successfully transferred his spirit to an iron golem (see <strong>area area 13</strong>), his body was placed here by the scaladar servants that guard <strong>area area 11b</strong>. The body is in stasis but can be attacked normally. It is <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> and has AC 12 and 99 hit points. Without its spirit, the body is an empty vessel, and Trobriand is unaware of what&rsquo;s happening to it while his spirit resides elsewhere. Destroying this body prevents Trobriand&rsquo;s spirit from returning to it when the spirit is forced to vacate the golem in <strong>area area 13</strong>, effectively killing the Metal Mage.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The bas-relief depicts Torhild Flametongue, king of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Besilmer, fighting a mortal enemy atop the Stone Bridge, a monument that spans the River Dessarin to this day. With a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check, a character recalls the legendary battle and the king&rsquo;s fate (he was struck from the bridge and fell to his death).</p>
<p>If a creature uses a finger or a staff to trace Halaster&rsquo;s rune on the surface of either of the standing stones, a gate forms between them and lasts for 1 minute. A <wc-fetch type=spell>legend lore</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals the way to activate the gate, its destination, and the fact that it&rsquo;s one-way only. Any creature that steps through this gate appears, along with any objects it is wearing or carrying, atop the middle of the Stone Bridge.

<p>Deactivating or destroying one or more of the pillars, destroying the golem, or forcing the golem out of the room causes Trobriand&rsquo;s spirit to vacate the golem and attempt to reunite with his normal body, which is hidden in <strong>area area 11c</strong>. If the characters have not destroyed his body, Trobriand&rsquo;s spirit returns to it immediately, and he awakens in <strong>area area 11c</strong> as an archmage with the same spell list as in his golem form and the same spell slots remaining as he had when he left his golem body. His primary goal thereafter is to destroy the characters for meddling in his affairs.</p>
<p>If the golem in this room has not been destroyed when Trobriand&rsquo;s spirit leaves it, the golem becomes an ordinary iron golem under the Metal Mage&rsquo;s command and attacks intruders on sight.</p>
<p>If the characters have already destroyed Trobriand&rsquo;s body in <strong>area area 11c</strong>, and then they deactivate or destroy at least one of the pillars in this room, Trobriand&rsquo;s spirit is forced to leave the golem but has nowhere to go, effectively killing him.</p>

<p>Rabbithead retreated here to escape Arcturia&rsquo;s presence and latches onto the adventurers, hoping they&rsquo;ll protect him from her wrath.

<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. Arranged throughout the hall are four stuffed chairs, four padded footstools, two divans, and two large coffee tables. (These furnishings are twelve Mimic in disguise. Arcturia considers them her most trusted friends. If the lich comes under attack or takes umbrage with visitors, the mimics are quick to reveal their true forms and fight alongside her.)</p>
<p><strong>Animal-Headed People</strong>. Standing between eight pillars are six humanoids that have the heads of beasts. Three wear servants' uniforms and carry feather dusters, and three wear heavy armor and carry swords.</p>

<p>Unable to abide normalcy and consistency, Arcturia fixates on transforming herself, her surroundings, and other creatures. Her moods are ever-changing as well.</p>
<p>If the characters destroyed her phylactery on level 14, Arcturia knows what they did and attacks them at once. Otherwise, she has no grievance with the adventurers and is happy to let them go on their way, neither helping or hindering their efforts.</p>

They have the following traits in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are unaligned.</li>
<li>They can&rsquo;t speak and know no languages.</li>

<p>The three humanoids wearing armor are Champion (see appendix A) with the heads of a dingo, an iguana, and a stork. If Arcturia becomes embroiled in a battle, two of them fight on her side.

<p>The three servants are unarmed Commoner with the heads of an aardvark, a moth, and a shrew. Whenever Arcturia snaps her fingers and points to a spot in the room, these servants begin dusting that location and don&rsquo;t stop until she snaps her fingers again. They otherwise avoid combat.</p>

It twists and undulates continuously, making it tricky to negotiate. Any creature that enters the corridor or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage as it is knocked about. If the creature is standing, walking, or running on the floor, the ceiling, or a wall when it fails this saving throw, it tumbles 20 feet down the tunnel before landing <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>.

<p><strong>Scintillating Pillar</strong>. A pillar at the center of the 20-foot-high room has deep notches cut into it, which pulse with a shifting rainbow of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behind most of the double doors are blank stone walls. Only the southern set of doors holds a path forward: pulling open these doors reveals <strong>area area 22</strong> beyond. Creatures that pass through the doorway get no sense that they&rsquo;re leaving Undermountain and entering Halaster&rsquo;s extradimensional tower.</p>
<p>Whenever a double door in this area is openedâ€”except the one to the south (see above)â€”the pillar emits colored rays from its myriad notches, duplicating the effect of a <wc-fetch type=spell>prismatic spray</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 22) that targets all creatures within 60 feet of the pillar.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Spelljamming Helm</strong>. In the middle of the room is a gilded wooden throne with a cushioned seat and backrest covered in black velvet sewn with silver stars.

<li>When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an envelope of fresh air around the ship while it is in the void of space (but not underwater). This envelope extends out from the edges of the hull in all directions for a distance equal in length to the vessel&rsquo;s beam, so that creatures aboard and near the ship can breathe normally in space. The temperature within the air envelope is 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an artificial gravity field while the ship is in the void of space, so that creatures can walk on the ship&rsquo;s decks as they normally would.

<p><strong>Ultroloths</strong>. Four Ultroloth (each marked with a U on map 23) lurk in alcoves along the north and south walls of this 30-foot-high room.</p>
<p><strong>Glass-Covered Acid Pit</strong>. The floor is a 6-inch-thick sheet of transparent glass, below which is a 30-foot-deep pit containing a 20-foot-deep pool of yellow acid. Visible through the churning, translucent acid are three 1-foot-diameter pitted iron wheels affixed to the pit floor in a triangular formation.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. A secret door in the east wall is locked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ultroloths spend most of their time using <wc-fetch type=spell>clairvoyance</wc-fetch> spells to scry on <strong>area area 20</strong>, but they emerge from their alcoves to attack anyone other than Halaster who enters this room. Their purpose here is to guard <strong>area area 21b</strong>. The acid pit doesn&rsquo;t concern the ultroloths, since they have immunity to acid damage.</p>
<p>Each 10-foot-square section of glass floor has AC 13, a damage threshold of 10, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying three or more 10-foot-square sections causes the remainder of the glass floor to shatter, dropping all creatures standing on it into the acid. Any creature that enters the acid or starts its turn in it takes 33 (<wc-roll>6d10</wc-roll>) acid damage.</p>
<p>A character can use an action to try to turn one of the iron wheels at the bottom of the acid pit, doing so with a successful DC 16 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A wheel can also be turned by a character using a <wc-fetch type=spell>telekinesis</wc-fetch> spell or similarly powerful magic. Turning all three wheels unlocks the secret door to <strong>area area 21b</strong>.</p>
<p>The secret door is above the acid and held shut by three internal sliding bolt locks, each of which is attached to one of the submerged iron wheels in the acid pit. In lieu of turning those wheels, characters need three separate <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spells to open the door (one per lock). The door can&rsquo;t be forced open otherwise. Once all three bolts are slid back, the door pushes open easily.</p>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>legend lore</wc-fetch> spell reveals that the shield was crafted for Nimoar, a legendary human warlord who died in 936 DR. After his death, the shield disappeared from Nimoar&rsquo;s Hold (a fortress that stood where Castle Waterdeep stands today), only to find its way here.</p>

Creatures that head north through the doorway get no sense that they&rsquo;re leaving Halaster&rsquo;s extradimensional tower and returning to Undermountain.</p>
<p>This room, which has several other doors leading away from it, contains the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Statue</strong>. Standing atop a raised stone dais in the middle of the room, facing the double door, is a life-size statue of Halaster, his arms raised before him and his face bearing an awkward smile.</p>
<p><strong>Rat</strong>. Gnawing on a piece of celery at the foot of the statue is an ordinary, harmless rat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he is not <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>, Halaster can touch the statue to teleport himself and anything he is wearing or carrying to a space within 5 feet of the statue in <strong>area area 28</strong> or the statue in <strong>area area 33</strong> (no action required).</p>

Gnome with No Name</h3><p>A 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide bronze-framed mirror leans against the far wall in this otherwise empty room. A creature that gazes into the mirror sees its reflection take the form of a female gnome in leather armor. She speaks Common and Gnomish, and is surprised to see the characters. Halaster trapped her in the mirror so long ago that she has lost track of time. The gnome has forgotten her name, after not interacting with other creatures for centuries. She longs to be free and asks the characters to help her.</p>
<p>The mirror is a Medium object with AC 11, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Breaking it or casting a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 19) on the mirror frees the gnome. However, without the mirror&rsquo;s magic to sustain her life, she instantly ages and dies, leaving nothing but dust, bones, and scraps of leather armor behind.</p>

Potion Brewery</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Cauldron</strong>. Fire erupts from a hole in the middle of the floor. Floating 1 foot above the fire is a hefty iron cauldron big enough for a person to hide in. A plume of black smoke rises from inside the cauldron.</p>
<p><strong>Paraphernalia</strong>. Behind the cauldron rests a wooden table cluttered with brewing equipment. The floor around the table is strewn with shattered glass and empty flasks. Tucked under the table is a wooden crate with Halaster&rsquo;s personal rune burned into its sides.</p>
<p><strong>Demilich</strong>. Floating behind the table is a demilich that looks like a human skull with a jagged crack that extends above and below one eye socket.</p>
<p><strong>Shelves and Ladder</strong>. The walls are lined with 10-foot-tall, wooden shelves packed with jars of pickled newts, frogs' eyes, and other common ingredients used in the brewing of potions. A wooden ladder on rollers is attached to a rail mounted above the shelves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This demilich is all that remains of Branta Myntion, a wizard who fell in with a bad crowd. Her hunger for magic set her on an evil path as she hunted down and killed other wizards to acquire their spellbooks. Before old age could claim her, Branta transformed herself into a lich. In this form, she came to Undermountain to plunder its magic. Halaster captured and enslaved her, promising to free her if she helped him brew potions. Tragically, that promise went unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Deprived of the ability to feed souls into her phylactery, which lies hidden in a dungeon far from Waterdeep, Branta&rsquo;s skeletal form deteriorated. Now, over a century later, only her skull remains. Years of captivity have driven the demilich insane, and it attacks anyone other than Halaster.</p>
<p>Although powerful wards prevent the demilich from leaving Halaster&rsquo;s tower, the tower is not considered its lair. Consequently, the demilich doesn&rsquo;t gain lair actions, nor does the tower exhibit the demilich&rsquo;s lair traits.</p>

<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around one of the bottles. Uncorking this bottle causes an elder rune to appear in the air above it (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>"). The rune targets the creature that opened the bottle. If the bottle was opened with a <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic, the rune targets the caster of the spell, provided the caster is within 60 feet of the opened bottle.

The spirit can do nothing other than animate and discharge the wand, which currently has 7 charges.</p>
<p>The animated wand has the statistics of a animated object (tiny) (see the <wc-fetch type=spell>animate objects</wc-fetch> spell description in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook). As an action, the animated wand can expend 1 of its charges and target a random creature with one of its randomly determined effects. Any such effect that would target the wand&rsquo;s user targets the wand instead. If reduced to 0 hit points, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel evil and good</wc-fetch> spell cast on the wand rids it of Rantantar&rsquo;s evil spirit, whereupon the wand clatters to the floor and becomes an inanimate <wc-fetch type=item>wand of wonder</wc-fetch>. An <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> spell suppresses the wand&rsquo;s magic but doesn&rsquo;t oust the spirit lodged inside it.</p>
<p>If the animated wand is grabbed while Rantantar&rsquo;s spirit is lodged inside it, a contest of wills ensues. The creature grabbing the wand must immediately make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is forced to release the wand. On a successful save, the wand becomes inanimate until the creature lets go of it. If a spellcaster holds the wand long enough to become attuned to it, that act banishes Rantantar&rsquo;s evil spirit from the wand forever.</p>

Apprentice Portraits</h3><p>Seven tall, framed portraits hang on the walls of this room. Embedded in the wall beneath each portrait is a small bronze plaque bearing a name. A character who examines the portraits and plaques can, with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check, confirm that these are paintings of Halaster&rsquo;s original seven apprentices, showing them as they were before they descended into Undermountain and were overcome by madness.</p>
<p>Each apprentice is shown wearing a <wc-fetch type=item>horned ring</wc-fetch> on one finger; these rings are identical and resemble the <wc-fetch type=item>horned ring</wc-fetch> worn by Halaster. The other features of each portrait are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Rantantar</strong> is a fat, frowning man scarred by fire. He wears ornate purple robes and grasps what looks like a <wc-fetch type=item>wand of wonder</wc-fetch> in his burned right hand.</p>
<p><strong>Nester</strong> is a handsome, slender man with thinning hair and a penetrating stare. He wears a plain black robe and many rings on his steepled fingers. Tattooed on his forehead is a tiny black rune. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check confirms that the rune represents the School of Necromancy.</p>
<p><strong>Trobriand the Metal Mage</strong> is a stoic, bearded man with black hair, black robes, and tinker&rsquo;s goggles. Perched on his shoulder is a tiny iron scorpion.</p>
<p><strong>Muiral the Misshapen</strong> is an ugly, powerfully built man with messy brown hair and a cruel sneer. He wears battered plate armor and has a steel helm with a scorpion motif tucked under his right arm. Clutched in his left hand is a longsword that drips blood.</p>
<p><strong>Arcturia</strong> has straw-like hair, bony features, blue-tinged skin, and an exasperated expression. She wears a wide-brimmed conical hat and a robe of butterflies. She holds up a finger, above which floats a tiny, glowing sigil. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check confirms that the sigil represents the School of Transmutation.</p>
<p><strong>Marambra Nyghtsteel</strong> is a striking woman with long auburn hair and an empty, distant gaze. She wears a black robe and holds a staff topped with a rune. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check confirms that the rune represents the School of Evocation.</p>
<p><strong>Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong> is a young, plain-looking woman dressed in yellow and blue robes. Her face betrays the subtlest hint of a smile. Her portrait has been slashed in half.</p>
<p>The first character who steps within 5 feet of the torn portrait of Jhesiyra Kestellharp hears a woman&rsquo;s voice whisper in their head: &ldquo;So close&mldr;&rdquo; If the portrait is repaired using a <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch> cantrip or similar magic, the image appears to come alive momentarily. Within the portrait, Jhesiyra removes the ring from her finger, causing the actual ring to tumble out of the painting onto the floor, from where it can be claimed. This <wc-fetch type=item>horned ring</wc-fetch> is a very rare magic item that allows an attuned wearer to ignore Undermountain&rsquo;s magical restrictions (see &ldquo;<strong>area Alterations to Magic</strong>").</p>

Scrying Room</h3><p>Hanging on the wall are what appear to be realistic paintings of cityscapes in gilded wooden frames. In truth, these &ldquo;paintings&rdquo; are magical scrying sensors that are fixed on the following locations in Waterdeep:</p>
<ul>
<li>The city&rsquo;s north gate, as seen from inside the city</li>
<li>The city&rsquo;s south gate, as seen from inside the city</li>
<li>The Swordmaiden, one of the walking statues of Waterdeep, in the North Ward</li>
<li>Heroes' Garden, a park in the Sea Ward</li>
<li>The exterior of the House of Wonder (temple of Mystra) in the Sea Ward</li>
<li>The exterior of the Font of Knowledge (temple of Oghma) in the Castle Ward</li>
<li>The exterior of Ahghairon&rsquo;s Tower in the Castle Ward</li>
<li>The exterior of Blackstaff Tower in the Castle Ward</li>
<li>The Market in the Castle Ward</li>
<li>The interior of the Yawning Portal&rsquo;s taproom and the entrance to Undermountain</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters acquainted with Waterdeep can easily recognize the locations being scried upon, since they are all prominent landmarks. Breaking a scrying device&rsquo;s frame or removing it from the wall destroys its magic.</p>

Art Studio</h3><p>Eight Living Unseen Servant (see appendix A) are painting four new portraits of Halaster and carving a statue of him in this room. Characters who enter the room see the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Painters</strong>. Brushes held by invisible hands are dabbing paint onto rectangles of canvas propped up on four wooden easels. At the same time, floating hammers and chisels are nibbling away at a large block of stone.</p>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>. Posing next to the stone block is a silent, illusory image of Halaster Blackcloak in a seductive pose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The illusion of Halaster has no substance and changes its pose every minute. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell cast on the illusion (DC 16) ends it.</p>
<p>The unseen servants ignore visitors, but they attack if their work is interrupted or if the illusion of Halaster is dispelled.</p>

Jhesiyra&rsquo;s Warning</h3><p>This room is furnished identically to <strong>area area 27</strong> (except for the presence of Rantantar&rsquo;s wand), perhaps causing characters to think they have reentered that room somehow.</p>
<p>As one or more characters cross this room and head toward the door to <strong>area area 33</strong>, Jhesiyra (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>") sends each of them the following telepathic warning in a language they know: &ldquo;The Mad Mage waits for you beyond the next door. Prepare yourselves!&rdquo;</p>

Mad Mage Showdown</h3><p>Halaster Blackcloak (see appendix A) awaits the characters in this room, which has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Raised Alcove</strong>. Steps ascend to a raised alcove that contains a purple marble throne surrounded by stacks of aged books. Carved into the wall behind the throne is Halaster&rsquo;s personal rune, and beneath the rune is a locked iron chest. (Halaster sits in the throne and is <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> when the characters enter.)</p>
<p><strong>Statue</strong>. On the opposite side of the room from the throne is a life-size stone statue of a nude Halaster wearing a cowboy hat and riding a donkey.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Circle</strong>. Inscribed on the floor in the middle of the room is a 40-foot-diameter circle of glowing runes. Halaster uses it to summon an empyrean who owes him a favor. (The circle serves no other purpose.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he is seated in the throne, Halaster remains <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> even while attacking or casting spells. When he sees one or more characters enter the room, he waves an <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> hand and causes the circle of runes on the floor to summon Nalkara (see &ldquo;<strong>area Nalkara the Empyrean</strong>&rdquo; below). He then uses the power of the throne to throw his voice so that he doesn&rsquo;t betray his location when he speaks to the empyrean.</p>
<p>Halaster orders Nalkara to slay the characters, regardless of his feelings toward them. If the characters pass the test by defeating the empyrean, Halaster again uses the throne to throw his voice and congratulates them. His next actions depend on his current goal (see &ldquo;<strong>area Halaster&rsquo;s Goals</strong>"):</p>
<ul>
<li>If the characters took any actions to further Halaster&rsquo;s current goal, he greets them warmly, thanks them for their help, returns any magic items they sacrificed to reach this level (see <strong>area area 35 on level 22</strong>), and allows them to leave his tower by way of the standing gate in <strong>area area 36</strong> (which he activates for them). The characters gain no XP for &ldquo;defeating&rdquo; Halaster in this fashion. If they refuse to leave, Halaster becomes annoyed and attacks them.</li>
<li>If the characters took any actions to hinder Halaster&rsquo;s current goal, the Mad Mage expresses his displeasure and attacks them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Five minutes after Halaster dies, the demiplane containing his tower collapses, scattering its contents across the Astral Plane (see &ldquo;<strong>area Conclusion</strong>").</p>

<p>Most of the books piled around the throne are worthless, rambling texts on the nature of magic and the multiverse. Among them are nine leather-bound spellbooks bearing Halaster&rsquo;s personal rune. Collectively, these spellbooks contain every spell on the wizard&rsquo;s spell list in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook. Individually, each book holds the spells of a specific level, 1st through 9th. Add spells from other sources you see fit.</p>
<p>Hidden in the cut-out pages of a leather-bound novel titled <em>Longsaddle Sunset</em> is a revolver loaded with six bullets (see &ldquo;Firearms&rdquo; in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide).</p>
<p>The iron chest behind the throne has an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell cast on it that Halaster alone can ignore. A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic opens the chest, as does a successful DC 25 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools. The chest contains a gold-plated herald&rsquo;s trumpet (250 gp); a coral beer stein painted with scenes of underwater life (500 gp); a cloak made of giant eagle feathers (750 gp); a delicate, multicolored, blown-glass lily trimmed with gold (1,250 gp); and a rolled-up painting of the Battle of Emridy Meadows, a conflict that transpired on a distant world called Oerth (2,500 gp).</p>

Flying Saucer</h3><p>This room contains one of Halaster&rsquo;s magical creations: a 20-foot-diameter flying saucer made of gleaming metal with its three landing struts extended. Surmounting the saucer is a hinged metal dome that is opaque from the outside and transparent from the inside. The entrance to the cockpit is 10 feet off the floor when the saucer is landed.</p>
<p>The saucer is a Huge object with AC 19, 200 hit points, a flying speed of 60 feet, the ability to hover, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is not airtight. Provided it has 50 or more hit points remaining, the saucer can be repaired as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each casting of the <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch> cantrip restores 1 hit point to the damaged saucer.</li>
<li>A character who has tinker&rsquo;s tools, proficiency in the <wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> skill, and 10 gp worth of replacement parts can spend 1 hour making repairs; at the end of the hour, the saucer regains <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> hit points.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the saucer. A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic opens the dome, as does a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools.</p>
<p>The dome covers a cockpit that contains a padded leather seat and a slanted metal console. Embedded in the console is an ornate metal joystick (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below) and three metal buttons labeled &ldquo;Hover,&rdquo; &ldquo;Land,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teleport.&rdquo; The rest of the saucer&rsquo;s interior is taken up by arcane machinery.</p>
<p>Pressing the &ldquo;Hover&rdquo; button causes the landing gear to retract and the saucer to levitate 10 feet in the air. When the saucer is airborne, the joystick can be used to fly the saucer in any direction the pilot desires.</p>
<p>Pressing the &ldquo;Land&rdquo; button causes the landing gear to extend and the saucer to sink at a rate of 10 feet per round until it lands on a surface that can bear its 2-ton weight. The joystick locks in place and is immovable while the saucer is landed.</p>
<p>Pressing the &ldquo;Teleport&rdquo; button teleports the saucer and its pilot, along with anything the pilot is wearing or carrying, to a lonely hilltop in the Forlorn Hills east of Waterdeep. The ship can&rsquo;t teleport again for 24 hours, and pressing the button again has no effect until this power recharges.</p>

The rod&rsquo;s normal magical properties are suppressed while it is attached to the flying saucer&rsquo;s console. The rod can be torn from the console by force with a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A character can also use <wc-fetch type=item>Thieves' Tools</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=item>Tinker&rsquo;s Tools</wc-fetch> to detach the rod from the console or reattach it, which requires 1 minute and no ability check. Without the rod in place, the flying saucer does not function.</p>

Exercise Room</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Golems</strong>. Two Flesh Golem are working out in this room. One golem is doing shoulder shrugs with two 100-pound iron kettlebells. The other switches back and forth between jumping jacks and shadowboxing.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Equipment</strong>. Padded leather mats are strewn upon the floor amid kettlebells and stacks of iron plates of various weights. Against the far wall rests a padded workout bench and an iron barbell bearing 400 pounds of weight. Behind the bench, hanging on the wall, is a set of boxing gloves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a character uses any of the room&rsquo;s equipment, the nearest golem stops its workout and stands ready to assist. The golems attack only if damage causes them to go berserk.</p>
<p>If a character dons the boxing gloves, one golem moves to the middle of the room, raises its fists, and trades blows with anyone who tries to box with it. It takes no damage from an adversary&rsquo;s gloved fists.</p>

Gate to Triboar</h3><p>This room contains a pair of 15-foot-tall standing stones. Lashed to each stone with 50 feet of hempen rope is an inanimate scarecrow, like the ones found in farmers' fields. Perched atop the northernmost standing stone is an ordinary crow (use the raven statistics). The crow caws at anyone who enters the room and bonds with a random character.</p>
<p>If a creature uses a finger or a staff to trace Halaster&rsquo;s rune on the surface of either of the standing stones, a gate forms between them and lasts for 1 minute. A <wc-fetch type=spell>legend lore</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals the way to activate the gate, its destination, and the fact that it&rsquo;s one-way only. Any creature that steps through this gate appears, along with any objects it is wearing or carrying, in a small cornfield behind a farmhouse on the outskirts of Triboar, a town far north of Waterdeep. (More information on Triboar can be found in Storm King&rsquo;s Thunder.)</p>

As the tower is torn asunder, its contents are blasted into the far corners of the Astral Plane. Characters who are holding onto one another or are tethered together end up in the same place on the Astral Plane until they find a means of escape or until a githyanki-crewed astral warship stumbles upon them. See chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide for more information on the Astral Plane and its perils.</p>
<p>Halaster&rsquo;s death also deactivates all gates in Undermountain. These gates reactivate when the Mad Mage re-forms <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> days later in a random dungeon location.</p>
<p>During Halaster&rsquo;s absence, Jhesiyra (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>") tries to seize control of Undermountain. Does she succeed? That&rsquo;s up to you. If she is successful, Jhesiyra takes her place as the new master of the dungeon, and Halaster does not return. Whether Jhesiyra remains disembodied or assumes a corporeal form when she usurps Halaster&rsquo;s control over Undermountain is also for you to decide, but one thing she won&rsquo;t do is reactivate Halaster&rsquo;s gates. She doesn&rsquo;t trust them and would prefer to create her own gates in due time. If Arcturia and Trobriand are still around, Jhesiyra plots to destroy them before they turn against her, and she might even draft adventurers to help her.</p>
<p>Existing in a disembodied state for so long has done little to preserve Jhesiyra&rsquo;s sanity, and it remains an open question whether Undermountain becomes a safer place with her in charge. In all likelihood, the dungeon will remain a perilous location, as Jhesiyra&rsquo;s fear that Halaster might someday return prompts her to ward the dungeon against that eventuality.</p>
<p>If Jhesiyra is unable to seize control of Undermountain, she continues to lurk in the dungeon as a disembodied entity, waiting for another opportunity to emerge. Unaware of Jhesiyra&rsquo;s attempt to dethrone him, Halaster re-forms in Undermountain as he has done many times before. He doesn&rsquo;t take being killed personally, but it inspires him to toughen Undermountain&rsquo;s defenses so that the next group of adventurers can&rsquo;t thwart him so easily. Much of his time in the coming months is spent creating a new demiplane and a new tower to replace the ones that were destroyed after he died.</p>
