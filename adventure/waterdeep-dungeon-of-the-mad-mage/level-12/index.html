The minotaurs hold sway over a maze of tunnels riddled with magical effects and traps, while the drow occupy the caves around an elegant fortress called Spiderwatch Keepâ€”a staging ground for House Freth&rsquo;s goal of conquering all of Undermountain.</p>
<p>Hostilities between the drow and the minotaurs have recently abated, in the wake of devastating losses on both sides. Drivvin Freth, a drow archmage, hopes to use this respite to his house&rsquo;s advantage by summoning a goristro demon that will force the minotaurs to submit to House Freth&rsquo;s control.</p>

Leading the effort is Erelal Freth, a drow priestess of Lolth. Her older brother Drivvin works at her side.</p>
<p>Erelal has communed with Lolth and believes that the key to securing the Troglodyte Warrens begins with the capitulation of the minotaurs on the Maze Level. Once the minotaurs are subservient to House Freth, the drow will use them to clear out and secure the warrens. To this end, Drivvin is devising a ritual to summon and control a goristro demon. By passing the goristro off as Baphomet, the demon lord of minotaurs, he hopes to win the minotaurs' obedience. But Drivvin has recently realized that his arcane knowledge is not sufficient to allow him to perfect the ritualâ€”and he&rsquo;s afraid of admitting his inadequacy to his sister.</p>
<p>The nature of the characters' prior association with House Auvryndar might affect how members of House Freth view them. If the characters collaborated with House Auvryndar and this fact becomes known to the leaders of House Freth, all future encounters with members of House Freth are likely to be hostile.</p>

Tendra Nightblade and Maleen Shadowdusk have been feted and flattered by Erelal Freth since they arrived. The drow priestess recognizes the potential benefit of an alliance, although she is also trying to ascertain whether Shadowdusk Hold has made similar overtures to House Auvryndar.</p>
<p>What Erelal doesn&rsquo;t realize is that House Shadowdusk has no interest in an alliance, and Tendra and Maleen have come to the Maze Level on a secret mission. Beholden to Halaster Blackcloak, the Shadowdusks have been ordered to convince Drivvin Freth to accept an apprenticeship under the Mad Mage. They have secretly informed him of Halaster&rsquo;s interest and of Halaster&rsquo;s offer to help him perfect the ritual that will bind a goristro to House Freth&rsquo;s service. They now wait for Drivvin&rsquo;s decision, while doing everything they can to ensure that he makes the right choice.</p>

They spend most of their time fighting the drow. Their leader is a priest of Baphomet named Maku, a devout follower of the Horned King who has tried to summon the demon lord on numerous occasions. The minotaur priest believes that his ritual will be successful if he can amass a large enough pile of mutilated corpses for the demon lord to feast on.</p>

All minotaurs on the Maze Level seek to emulate him through their blood lust and savagery. He appears as a great, black-furred minotaur with iron horns, burning red fire in his eyes, and a massive bloodstained glaive. Fervent human cultists of Baphomet are sometimes transformed into minotaurs as a reward for their devotion and sacrifice.</p>

<p>A 2-foot-thick layer of fog covers the floor in many of the Maze Level&rsquo;s tunnels and caves; the area within the fog is heavily obscured. The fog can be cleared away by a <wc-fetch type=spell>gust of wind</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. Fog that is cleared away returns in 1 minute.</p>
<p>The stench of death pervades the entire level, growing stronger as the characters get closer to area 8a.</p>

<p>An <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> will-o'-wisp dwells here, the dark essence of a female drow priestess named Z&rsquo;reska, who was butchered by minotaurs. As the characters move through the cave, the will-o'-wisp flies into the tunnel that leads northwest out of this area and illuminates itself. It whispers, &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; in Elvish, trying to stay at least 50 feet ahead of characters who do so. It attempts to lure creatures into <strong>area area 7</strong> and provoke a battle with the minotaurs. If the characters refuse to follow the will-o'-wisp, it turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and trails them instead, waiting until one or more characters are near death before attacking them in an attempt to finish them off.</p>

The mirror&rsquo;s frame is carved with vines that twist through eleven actual humanoid skulls mounted to the frame. Carved into the bottom of the frame are the following words in Celestial: &ldquo;The dead know the secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mirror is one of Halaster&rsquo;s gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). Its rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaking the proper command word while standing in front of the mirror opens the gate for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Characters must be 11th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 11e on level 10</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> on one of the skulls forces it to reveal the gate&rsquo;s command word (&ldquo;Axallian&rdquo;), which Halaster changes every few days. The skulls are otherwise hostile and refuse to answer questions put to them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The minotaurs are stationed throughout the cavern, guarding against a drow attack. They are famished, having been forced to sacrifice their food for Maku&rsquo;s ritual (see <strong>area area 8a</strong>). They spring out when they see or hear any creatures in this area, charging intruders and ignoring any attempts to parley. The minotaurs fight to the death and loudly devour their kills if they are victorious.

Keep Calm and Carrion</h4><p>The stench of death that permeates the dungeon is strongest here. As the characters approach this 50-foot-high cave, they hear minotaurs chanting and stomping. This area contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Minotaurs</strong>. The fog swirls through this cavern, agitated by the dancing of eleven chanting Minotaur.</p>
<p><strong>Offal Pile</strong>. Low stone barriers constrain a massive pile of rotting, dismembered body parts.</p>
<p><strong>Altar</strong>. Behind the offal pile stands a crude altar made of minotaur fur stretched over a frame of sinew-lashed minotaur bones. Two poles thrust out of the altar, each with a minotaur skull atop it.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. The secret door in the west wall is an 8-foot-square section of stone that pivots on a central axis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minotaurs are led by Maku, who has 117 hit points, wears a shawl made of drow entrails, and clutches a brass horn (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). The minotaur shaman treats all intruders as enemies to be carved up and added to his pile of dismembered bodies. His first action in combat is to blow his brass horn while the other minotaurs try to hack intruders to pieces.</p>
<p>Baphomet does not answer prayers, nor does the demon lord have any interest in Maku&rsquo;s tribe. As such, the minotaur shaman&rsquo;s ritual has no chance of working. But the sacrifices performed in this area have saturated the cave with evil power, such that any humanoid that makes a weapon attack in this area must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be cursed with blood lust. While cursed in this way, the creature is hostile toward all other creatures it can see and must use its action each turn to attack the creature closest to it. (If multiple targets are equally close, the target is determined randomly.) <wc-fetch type=spell>Greater restoration</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch>, or similar magic ends the blood lust on a creature. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw against this effect is immune to it for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>The altar is made out of two minotaurs that were killed and devoured in a cannibalistic ritual. Any creature that touches the altar experiences a ghastly vision of being torn apart and eaten by minotaurs.</p>

<p>A single character can search through the pile of body parts in 1 hour, while multiple characters working together can reduce the search time proportionally. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell can further expedite a specific search for magic items. The search yields a spider silk pouch containing 50 gp, two obsidian scarabs engraved with the insignia of House Freth (25 gp each), a jeweled anklet (750 gp), and one of a pair of <wc-fetch type=item>gloves of missile snaring</wc-fetch> worn on the severed limb of its previous drow owner.

All four are crouched down in the fog.</p>
<p>Llorelve and Vorljas spring up at the first sounds of creatures approaching this area, and they attack anyone they don&rsquo;t recognize. Any humanoids they don&rsquo;t know are assumed to be allied with House Auvryndar.</p>

The cave contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fog</strong>. The floor here is covered by a 2-foot-thick layer of fog that obscures mounds of bat guano. (If the fog is cleared away, drow, quaggoth, and giant lizard tracks can be seen in the guano. The tracks go in all directions, but most lead west toward the drow fortress.)</p>
<p><strong>Bat Alarm</strong>. Hundreds of Bat cling to the 30-foot-high domed ceiling. The drow use the bats as an alarm of sorts, knowing that the creatures become agitated and expect to be fed whenever humanoids enter the cave.</p>
<p><strong>Web Cables</strong>. The tunnels leading to <strong>area areas 12a</strong> and <strong>area 12b</strong> rise up out of the fog and are strung with web cables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drow release crickets into this area to feed the bats. Expecting to be fed, the bats start to shriek and flap about the cave when the characters arrive, alerting the drow guards in <strong>area areas 12a</strong>, <strong>area 12b</strong>, and <strong>area 18a</strong>.</p>

One such tunnel slopes down gently to <strong>area area 11</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Undead</strong>. Six Minotaur Skeleton stand in the middle of the cave, ready to attack any creature that isn&rsquo;t a drow.</p>
<p><strong>Drow</strong>. Four male Drow Elite Warrior hide in the dead-end tunnels to the south. Any character who has a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 20 or higher spots these guards.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Stones</strong>. The northern part of the cave contains two large standing stones, each of which has an inanimate minotaur skeleton embedded in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a battle erupts here, the drow in <strong>area area 12b</strong> use signal horns to sound the alarm before joining the fight. They are quickly joined by reinforcements from <strong>area areas 12c</strong> and <strong>area 12d</strong>.</p>
<p>These drow are well trained, and their loyalty to House Freth is beyond question. Their leader, Tanimar Freth, is the second of Erelal&rsquo;s three sons. He lost his right eye in a sword fight against a House Auvryndar rival; his empty eye socket and scar are plain for all to see. One consequence of his injury is that Tanimar has been relegated to guard duty. He fights alongside his younger brother, Xaphtal Freth. The other two drow are named Hexab Do&rsquo;ett and Moltar Barrek&rsquo;zorn.</p>
<p>If the battle turns against them, the drow use <wc-fetch type=spell>darkness</wc-fetch> spells to cover their retreat to the fortress (area 18). They know the tunnels well enough to navigate them blindly. Xaphtal seizes any opportunity to dispose of his older brother, provided the risk to himself is minimal. The other drow are not surprised by Xaphtal&rsquo;s treacheryâ€”Tanimar least of all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards</strong>. Four male drow are on guard here.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Spider</strong>. A giant iron spider stands motionless in the middle of the cave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drow (named Freb, Rylzzt, Urlimar, and Vanalfein) all carry signal horns that sound an alarm loud enough to be heard in <strong>area areas 10</strong> through <strong>area 19</strong>. They raise the alarm at the first sign of intruders, bringing reinforcements from <strong>area areas 12a</strong>, <strong>area 12c</strong>, and <strong>area 12d</strong>.</p>
<p>The iron spider is a Large unaligned construct that stands 7 feet tall. It has AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Its ability scores are as follows: Strength 18, Dexterity 10, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. Its climbing and walking speeds are 30 feet, and it can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. It has <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet and is blind beyond this radius.</p>
<p>As an action, the iron spider can shoot out a 6-inch-thick web cable up to 50 feet long, attaching the far end of the cable to a solid surface up to 50 feet away from it. As a bonus action, it can detach the other end of the cable from itself and attach it to a solid surface within 10 feet of it. Once it creates 200 feet of web cable, the spider can&rsquo;t produce any more cable until the next dawn. The iron spider exists solely to produce web cables. It has no attacks and no instinct for self-preservation.</p>
<p>Like a scaladar, the iron spider has a control ring (possessed by Drivvin Freth). The iron spider obeys the commands of whoever wears its control ring. The spider is <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> in the area of an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> spell.

Giant Lizard Pen</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Monsters</strong>. Ten docile Giant Lizard are tethered to iron spikes pounded into the cave floor. Five drow, one female and four males, watch over the lizards.</p>
<p><strong>Fungi</strong>. The 20-foot-high walls are covered with ripplebark (see &ldquo;<strong>area Fungi</strong>"), which the drow feed to the giant lizards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leader of this group is a female drow named Talabsyn Freth, the youngest of Erelal&rsquo;s seven daughters. The others are unfaithful male subordinates named Beleth, Cazimir, Ryldgar, and Zakth. At the first sign of trouble, Talabsyn untethers the nearest giant lizard and tries to escape on its back, fleeing to her family&rsquo;s fortress by the safest route while the males cover her escape. If her escape routes are cut off, Talabsyn surrenders and orders the males to do the same, hoping her captors try to ransom her. She betrays any of the male drow in a heartbeat to save herselfâ€”and the males do the same to her.</p>
<p>Drow scouts use the giant lizards as mounts. Each comes equipped with a saddle, reins, stirrups, and saddlebags containing 30 days of rations (dry moss and mushrooms). The giant lizards have the Spider Climb trait (see the &ldquo;Variant: Giant Lizard Traits&rdquo; sidebar in appendix A of the Monster Manual), which allows them to climb over the web cables and exit this area.</p>

Roundabout</h3><p>A bore wormâ€”a metal construct similar in size and shape to a purple wormâ€”hollowed out this donut-shaped chamber as part of excavating the passage that leads down to level 13. Characters who descend to level 13 encounter the worm (see &ldquo;<strong>area Bore Worm</strong>").</p>
<p>Once an hour, the bore worm makes its way up the tunnel from level 13 and circles this area clockwise before returning below. The worm doesn&rsquo;t fill the entire tunnel, so smaller creatures can try to slip past it. When the worm enters a smaller creature&rsquo;s space for the first time on a turn, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature avoids being crushed between the worm and the tunnel wall. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage.</p>

Dead End?</h3><p>This 15-foot-high cave extends beneath <strong>area area 15</strong>. It contains the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Web Cables</strong>. Web cables crisscross the tunnel that leads into this area.</p>
<p><strong>Rock Formation</strong>. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide rock formation shaped like a huge clawed hand thrusts up from the floor in the west end of the cave. (A secret door is built into the ceiling directly above the claw.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claw is a natural rock formation and shows no sign of having been sculpted. Creatures can easily climb up onto it. Lying on the floor next to the claw, in plain sight, is a stubby iron key with a head shaped like a tiny bulbous nose. This key unlocks the iron doors of Zox Clammersham&rsquo;s palace (see <strong>area area 7 on level 13</strong>).</p>
<p>The secret door in the ceiling can be reached by anyone who stands atop the rock formation. The door is an 8-foot-square, 1-foot-thick slab of stone that pivots on a central axis. Pushing or pulling it open from below requires a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. The secret door remains open until it is manually closed again.</p>

Crickets</h3><p>The characters hear the incessant chirping of crickets as they approach this 20-foot-high cavern. The area has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Web Cables</strong>. Both tunnels leading to the cavern are strung with web cables.</p>
<p><strong>Crates</strong>. Dispersed throughout the cavern are ten large zurkhwood crates with mesh screens covering their open tops.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. A secret door is set into the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each crate contains hundreds of harmless, chirping cave crickets, feeding from a 1-foot-deep bed of bat guano mixed with maggot-ridden offal. The cave crickets are used by the drow to feed the bats in <strong>area area 11</strong>.</p>
<p>The secret door in the floor is an 8-foot-square, 1-foot-thick slab of stone that pivots on a central axis. Opening it requires a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. Applying 150 pounds of weight to either side of the door also causes it to swing open. Any creature that accidentally opens the door by standing on it can avoid a fall by making a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that falls through the open door drops 10 feet and lands on the claw-shaped rock formation in <strong>area area 14</strong>, taking 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage.</p>

Demons' Ledge</h3><p>Two ramps lead up to a 40-foot-high ledge that mostly encircles the walls of an immense, dark cavern. The ledge nearly surrounds the drow fortress. There are no gaps in the stone where the walls of the ledge meet the walls of the fortress.</p>
<p>Five Vrock are perched on the ledge, one each at locations <strong>area 17a</strong> through <strong>area 17e</strong>. These demons were summoned by Drivvin Freth, and they obey only his commands. The vrocks use their <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> to scan the cavern for intruders.</p>
<p>When a vrock sees something suspicious, it emits a loud screech that can be heard throughout areas 10 through 19, alerting all creatures in those locations. The demons then eagerly join any battle that erupts.</p>

Drow Fortress</h3><p>House Freth built its dark fortress in a 100-foot-high cavern, the roof of which is dotted with stalactites. Outside the fortress walls, the cavern floor is hidden under a 2-foot-thick layer of fog. The fog is absent inside the walls and around Spiderwatch Keep, the great edifice at the heart of the fortress (<strong>area area 19</strong>).</p>
<p>There are no light sources in or around the fortress. Anyone approaching with light draws the attention of the drow in the guard towers and the vrocks in <strong>area area 17</strong>.</p>
<p>The north end of the fortress grounds is where the drow cultivate food using the labor of prisoners and thralls. The spacious area southeast of the keep is used for military drills, weapon practice, and assembling before expeditions.</p>

The tops of the walls are tapered and lined with 5-foot-tall stone spikes spaced 10 feet apart. The spikes have sticky webs strung between them like barbed wire to hinder creatures attempting to cross over. For the effects of sticky webs, see &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. Each tower has a flat roof encircled by crenellated battlements. If an alarm is raised, the residents of the fortress mobilize quickly. Twenty drow emerge from the barracks in <strong>area areas 18e</strong> and <strong>area 18f</strong>, joining Rilna Freth (from <strong>area area 19c</strong>) and four drow elite warriors (from <strong>area area 19a</strong>). These drow take up defensive positions in the courtyard, spreading out to dilute the effect of area attacks. Against unusually strong foes, Rilna releases the prisoners in <strong>area areas 18g</strong> and <strong>area 18h</strong>, forcing them to fight for House Freth. But the moment the fight turns against the drow, the prisoners turn against their captors. In addition to the drow in the courtyard, invaders must contend with the drow in the guard towers, who can target creatures both inside and outside the courtyard. Each of the guard towers (<strong>area areas 18a</strong> through <strong>area 18d</strong>) is utilitarian and unfurnished. A tower has the following features and defenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The tower&rsquo;s stone doors are reinforced and barred from the inside. Siege weapons are needed to break them down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrow slits on the first and second floors provide three-quarters cover to those standing behind them. The rooftop battlements provide variable cover, depending on the angle of attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iron ladders and trapdoors connect each level of a tower, and the trapdoor in the roof can be bolted shut from below. Breaking through a bolted trapdoor requires a successful DC 27 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each tower contains eight male drow (four on each of the first and second floors) who fire light crossbows through the arrow slits. This attack is the same as the drow&rsquo;s hand crossbow attack, except it has a range of 80/320 feet and deals 6 (<wc-roll>1d8 + 2</wc-roll>) piercing damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A male drow mage stands watch on the rooftop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characters who have House Freth escorts or who wear clever drow disguises can approach the fortress openly. The mage atop the gate tower (<strong>area area 18a</strong>) demands to know who they are and why they have come, granting entry only if their answers raise no suspicions. As the visitors make their way through the tower, the drow mage summons a quasit and instructs it to notify Rilna Freth of the new arrivals. The quasit assumes bat form and flies to <strong>area area 19c</strong> to deliver the news. Rilna decides what to do with any visitors and leads those who seek an audience with her sister, Erelal, to <strong>area area 19k</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

A male drow mage named Llaxdorl Freth (Erelal&rsquo;s cousin) stands watch on the roof, and eight male drow are on guard inside.</p>
<p>Characters brought to the fortress as prisoners are stripped of their weapons and spellcasting implements as they pass through the tower. They are then detained in the courtyard until Rilna Freth (see <strong>area area 19c</strong>) decides their fate. Prisoners with no obvious value to the drow are sent to the slave pens (<strong>area areas 18g</strong> and <strong>area 18h</strong>). Everyone else is brought to Erelal Freth in area 19k for further questioning.</p>

Garden Slave Pen</h4><p>The foul stench of troglodytes is obvious to any characters who approach this 40-foot-square enclosure, which has 20-foot-high walls of smooth stone, an iron-barred gate, and a 5-foot-thick roof of sticky webs with five Giant Spider atop it. The pen currently holds five adult Troglodyte and four troglodyte children (Small noncombatants), as well as a minotaur chained to the ground. The minotaur&rsquo;s horns have been sawed off, and prolonged exposure to the troglodytes' stench has rendered the minotaur immune to its effects.</p>
<p>The spiders attack anyone who tries to tear through the webs or free the slaves trapped in the pen.</p>
<p>Any creature that enters the webs or starts its turn in them is <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch>. A <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> creature can use its action to try to pull itself out of the webs, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) or Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check. Each 10-foot-square section of webs has AC 10, 10 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.</p>
<p>The pen&rsquo;s sturdy iron gate is held shut with an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell that only drow (including drow characters) can ignore. Forcing it open requires a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

The minotaur is too violent to be enslaved, so the drow are starving it until it either capitulates or grows so weak that the troglodytes can kill and devour it. The minotaur is <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> but can butt foes with its head instead of making gore attacks, dealing 11 (<wc-roll>2d6 + 4</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

The contents of the pen are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Goblins</strong>. Twelve armed but weary-looking Goblin are gnawing on bones and resting on straw pallets.</p>
<p><strong>Refuse</strong>. The pen is littered with the skulls and bones of deep gnomes and goblins, as well as a few drow who angered Erelal Freth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drow use these goblin slaves as laborers. Each goblin suffers from two levels of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>. The goblins cower and beg for their lives when faced with possible harm. Despite their pitiable appearance, they can&rsquo;t be trusted and will do anything to survive, including betraying and eating their liberators.</p>

Edible moss is grown in the east garden, while the other two gardens contain rows of barrelstalks and bluecaps (see &ldquo;<strong>area Fungi</strong>").</p>
<p>Tending each garden are two adult Troglodyte and three troglodyte children (Small noncombatants) that work under the watchful gaze of a male drow overseer.

Spiderwatch Keep</h3><p>Fashioned from seamless black stone with veins of silver running through it, this windowless edifice bears a striking resemblance to a crouching spider. From here, Erelal Freth oversees all House Freth ventures in Undermountain, with her brother Drivvin as her advisor.</p>
<p>The central oval of the keep (<strong>area areas 19e</strong> through <strong>area 19k</strong>) has 15-foot-high walls and a 30-foot-high domed roof. The attached outer structures (<strong>area areas 19a</strong> through <strong>area 19d</strong>) have 10-foot-high walls and 20-foot-high domed roofs.</p>
<p>All outer doors are held shut with <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spells that only drow wearing the obsidian insignia scarabs of House Freth can ignore. A successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check is needed to force open such a door. The inner doors have no locks.</p>
<p>When an alarm sounds outside, the occupants of the keep prepare for battle but remain where they are. They cannot be surprised, and any ability checks to convince residents that intruding characters are not a threat are made with disadvantage. This state of battle readiness is maintained until Rilna Freth tells occupants of the fortress that it is secure.</p>

This area has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hole</strong>. A 2-foot-diameter hole is cut through the roof. The hole, 20 feet above the floor, allows quasits in bat form to deliver messages to Rilna from the gate tower (<strong>area area 18a</strong>). A Small creature can slip through the hole easily, and a Medium creature can do so with a successful DC 17 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

<p><strong>Hammock</strong>. A spider silk hammock hangs to the west.</p>
<p><strong>Chest</strong>. A padlocked iron chest to the east has a lid embossed with tiny spiders.</p>

<p>Maleen and Tendra have come from Shadowdusk Hold (level 22) on the orders of Halaster Blackcloak. Under the guise of seeking an alliance between Shadowdusk Hold and House Freth, they have extended an offer to Drivvin Freth to become the Mad Mage&rsquo;s newest apprentice. Drivvin has told the two that he needs time to make his decision, and now the emissaries have grown anxious waiting for his answer.</p>
<p>Both emissaries show evidence of their (false) interest in currying favor with House Freth by coming to its defense if Spiderwatch Keep is attacked, but they flee the fortress if Erelal and Drivvin both fall in battle.</p>

Erelal&rsquo;s Sanctum</h4><p>Erelal uses this area to engage in numerous dark pleasures. The room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prisoners</strong>. Two male drow hang suspended from manacled iron chains anchored to the curved outer wall. Two other sets of manacles hang empty.</p>
<p><strong>Cradle</strong>. Against the south wall, between the two doors, is an ornate cradle carved with spiders and fitted with a protective web-like canopy.</p>
<p><strong>Table</strong>. On a small table next to the cradle sits a small black casket. The table has a lower shelf with a ring of iron keys resting on it. (The keys unlock the manacles in this room.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both prisoners have been strung up to face the wall, their bare backs covered in blood from the cuts inflicted by Erelal Freth&rsquo;s scourge.</p>
<p>One of the prisoners is Hatchrin Alet&rsquo;taz, consort of Erelal Freth and the father of her unborn eleventh child. He is unarmed and unarmored, and has 3 hit points remaining. Erelal is torturing him because she received a report that someone close to her was planning to poison her child after its birth, then found a vial of poison on his person. (The false report and the planting of the poison are both the work of Drivvin Freth, who wants to get Hatchrin out of his sister&rsquo;s life.) Hatchrin promises any service to characters who can help him regain Erelal&rsquo;s trust and thus enable him to see the birth of his child.</p>
<p>The other drow prisoner is a House Auvryndar spy named Varrn Telenna. He is unarmed and unarmored, and has 6 hit points remaining. Erelal has finished interrogating him, and Varrn is beyond caring whether he lives or dies. If he is set free, Varrn thanks the characters, praises Lolth for sparing his life, and plots his escape.</p>

<p>The black casket is a false offering of fealty brought by the Shadowdusk emissaries. It is set with mother-of-pearl and emblazoned with a painted gold emblem of the Shadowdusk family: a lit torch with three trailing embers, turned upside down.

Mother and Brother</h4><p>As the characters approach any of the doors to this area, they hear a female voice shouting in Elvish, followed by a male voice&rsquo;s muted responses. Erelal Freth is chastising her brother Drivvin for his repeated failures to bring the minotaurs of the southern caves under drow control. The western door has an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell cast on it that only drow wearing the obsidian scarab insignia of House Freth can ignore. The room&rsquo;s occupants and contents are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Drow</strong>. Erelal Freth, a pregnant drow priestess of Lolth, reclines on a cushioned crystal divan of web-like design in the middle of the room. Two male drow are attending Erelal while Drivvin Freth, a drow archmage, paces angrily around the room.</p>
<p><strong>Cabinet</strong>. A glass-fronted cabinet against the north wall contains a crystal decanter of mushroom wine and several varnished zurkhwood goblets.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine</strong>. Against the east wall stands an impressive silver shrine to Lolth (see &ldquo;Shrine of Lolth&rdquo; below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erelal wears a flowing black and silver gown instead of armor, giving her AC 12, but is still armed with her scourge. The male drow with her are Chaszantar and Ulgreth, two sycophants vying to become her new consort. They both wear spider silk togas instead of armor, giving them AC 12.</p>
<p>Erelal is a mere thirty days away from giving birth to her eleventh child, but she refuses to let her pregnancy interfere with her work: the destruction of House Auvryndar and the conquest of Undermountain. A string of military defeats has left Erelal in no mood to entertain visitors, and her brother has yet to make good on his promise to enslave the minotaurs of the Maze Level. Visitors who have business or grievances with Erelal are dealt with as quickly as possible. Those who come to her with frivolous affairs are scolded, threatened, and sent away with a stern warning not to trouble her again.</p>
<p>If she is threatened, Erelal tries to summon a yochlol demon to defend her. If the shrine of Lolth in this chamber is intact, the demon summoning has a 90 percent chance of success. Erelal then hinders her enemies with a <wc-fetch type=spell>darkness</wc-fetch> spell before taking the safest exit. Giant spiders that she summons with the <wc-fetch type=spell>conjure animals</wc-fetch> spell use their <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> to target enemies that are engulfed in magical darkness. If her defeat is inevitable and escape proves impossible, Erelal makes whatever concessions she must to save herself and her unborn child.</p>
<p>Erelal&rsquo;s older brother is clad in a long gray robe with black, web-like tracery. Drivvin has convinced his sister that he has the power to enslave the minotaurs, which would enable House Freth to defeat the forces of House Auvryndar and secure its power in Undermountain. But, having realized that he can&rsquo;t summon a goristro demon alone, the archmage understands that accepting Halaster&rsquo;s offer and his promise of assistance is the only way his plan will succeed. Drivvin knows that if he leaves his sister to become Halaster&rsquo;s apprenticeâ€”even though that act is ultimately for her own gainâ€”he will be cast out from his family. Drivvin is looking for the right time to break the news to his sister, whose recent defeats at the hands of House Auvryndar have made her despondent.</p>
<p>Drivvin is a drow archmage, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is neutral evil.</li>
<li>He has these racial traits: He speaks Abyssal, Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Goblin, and Undercommon. He has advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>, and magic can&rsquo;t put him to sleep. He has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 120 feet. He can innately cast <wc-fetch type=spell>dancing lights</wc-fetch> at will, and can cast <wc-fetch type=spell>darkness</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>faerie fire</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=spell>levitate</wc-fetch> (self only) each once per day. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li>He has cast <wc-fetch type=spell>mind blank</wc-fetch> on himself.</li>
<li>Once per day as an action, Drivvin can summon a demon that has a challenge rating of 6 or lower. The summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of him, acts as his ally, and can&rsquo;t summon other demons. The summoned demon remains until Drivvin dismisses it as an action or until the demon is reduced to 0 hit points.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a fight breaks out here, Drivvin uses his first action in combat to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>time stop</wc-fetch>. He uses the extra time granted by the spell to summon a barlgura and cast <wc-fetch type=spell>fire shield</wc-fetch> on himself, as well as <wc-fetch type=spell>mage armor</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>stoneskin</wc-fetch> if he hasn&rsquo;t done so already. Drivvin fights to the finish to defend his sister.</p>

The silver cage is fused to the wall and can&rsquo;t be detached from it. Inside the cage is a 3-foot-tall obsidian statue of Lolth in her drow form. The statue is smeared with sacrificial blood, and a blood-caked obsidian dagger rests at the statue&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Any creature that removes the statue from the shrine immediately contracts a disease called slimy doom. The disease lasts for 7 days or until cured with a <wc-fetch type=spell>lesser restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. A creature afflicted with slimy doom begins to bleed uncontrollably, and has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is <wc-fetch type=condition>stunned</wc-fetch> until the end of its next turn.</p>

<p>The statue of Lolth weighs 250 pounds and is worth 2,500 gp as an art object. The obsidian dagger at the shrine is worth 250 gp.</p>
<p>The delicate crystal decanter in the wine cabinet is worth 250 gp, but it shatters easily.</p>
<p>Drivvin wears an iron ring that serves as the control ring for the iron spider in <strong>area area 12b</strong>.</p>

The summoning ritual takes 30 days to prepare, and it is performed by Drivvin and Halaster in the courtyard of the drow fortress.</p>
<p>When the demon appears, Halaster traps it in a 5,000 gp ruby and gives the gemstone to Drivvin. Under the cloak of an <wc-fetch type=spell>invisibility</wc-fetch> spell, Drivvin takes the gem to <strong>area area 8a</strong> and breaks it, releasing the goristro there. Mistaking the demon for an emissary of Baphomet, the minotaurs watch as it devours the carrion in <strong>area area 8a</strong>. When it has no more carrion to feed on, it begins devouring whatever it can kill. Once its hunger is satisfied, the demon sends its new minotaur lackeys to kill everything on level 11 and bring it more food to eat. The goristro considers any drow wearing the insignia of House Freth to be its ally, and orders its minotaurs to go forth and slay all other creatures.</p>
<p>If Erelal Freth survives, she gives birth to her eighth daughter, Amalica, and continues to wage war against House Auvryndar and its allies. Amalica&rsquo;s birth is viewed as a sign of Lolth&rsquo;s favor, renewing House Freth&rsquo;s resolve and turning the tide in its favor. Several houses formerly allied with House Auvryndar switch sides and send emissaries to Erelal with gifts for her blessed newborn.</p>
<p>If Erelal and Drivvin perish, House Freth&rsquo;s allies abandon the house out of fear that Lolth has forsaken them. Without these allies, House Freth becomes too weak to defend itself against even its minotaur neighbors. The survivors hole up in the fortress while envoys are dispatched to the Underdark to secure reinforcements. Those reinforcements won&rsquo;t arrive in time if Vlonwelv Auvryndar (see level 10) has her way.</p>
