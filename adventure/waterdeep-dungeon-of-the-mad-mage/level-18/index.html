<p>Vanrakdoom is designed for four 15th-level characters, and those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance halfway to 16th level. The level is named after Vanrak Moonstar, a Waterdavian noble who turned to the worship of Shar (god of darkness and loss), descended into Undermountain, and became a death knight. To grasp what&rsquo;s happening on this level and why, one needs to know the fate that befell Lord Moonstar.</p>

Vanrak was but a pale shadow of his former self when he returned. A few tendays later, his father, Lord Andvarran Moonstar, the family patriarch, died of a strange wasting disease that could not be cured by healing magic.</p>
<p>Upon assuming leadership of House Moonstar, Vanrak publicly broke with the temple of Selûne (god of the moon), which he blamed for his father&rsquo;s untimely death. Consumed with bitterness, the Dark Ranger, as Vanrak came to be known, secretly embraced Selûne&rsquo;s sister: Shar, the Lady of Loss.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Howling Moon (1130 DR), House Moonstar was in open schism. Family members who still venerated Selûne aligned themselves with Lord Vanrak&rsquo;s sister, Lady Alathene, and Selûne&rsquo;s priesthood. Meanwhile, Lord Vanrak and his followers extended their dark influence over much of the city&rsquo;s harbor with the aid of a small army of mercenaries bolstered by followers of Shar.</p>
<p>Lady Alathene appeared in open court and asked the Lords of Waterdeep to strip her brother of his title and banish him from the city. She also presented evidence of her brother&rsquo;s numerous crimes, including slavery, arson, theft, and murder. The Lords ordered the immediate capture of the Dark Ranger, but by the time the City Watch had breached the gates of his villa, Vanrak and his followers had already fled through a secret portal into Undermountain. He and his followers remained there until, in the Year of the Dark Mask (1171 DR), they conquered the level of Undermountain that came to be known as Vanrakdoom.</p>
<p>Operating from his new base, Vanrak extended his influence throughout much of Undermountain and even periodically dispatched elite strike teams to battle followers of Selûne in the city above. He achieved his most dramatic success in the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when his followers infiltrated the High House of Stars through its cellars, slaughtered most of the inhabitants before they could raise an alarm, engulfed the temple in black fire, and burned it to the ground. The invaders also acquired enough treasure from the temple vaults to fund Lord Vanrak&rsquo;s personal quest for immortality. Within a few years, the Dark Ranger had transformed himself into a death knight.</p>
<p>The Lords of Waterdeep didn&rsquo;t make things easy for Vanrak Moonstar in the years that followed. They hired waves of adventurers to descend into Undermountain to bring Vanrak and his followers to justice. Although none of these adventurers succeeded, they winnowed down Vanrak&rsquo;s army to the point where he could no longer threaten the city.</p>
<p>Halaster Blackcloak compounded Vanrak&rsquo;s woes by urging other Undermountain dwellers to invade Vanrakdoom from time to time. In a desperate move, the few remaining priests of Shar performed rituals to harness the despair of Vanrak&rsquo;s shadow dragon mount, Umbraxakar, and use him to transport Vanrakdoom into the Shadowfell. In the end, Halaster&rsquo;s magical hold over Undermountain proved too strong to overcome, yet a small section of Vanrakdoom crossed over into the Plane of Shadow and became ensconced there.</p>
<p>Confronted by failure, Vanrak came to believe that Shar had deceived him and had orchestrated his downfall solely to spite her nemesis, Selûne. Vanrak had lost his family, his title, and most of his army, and he was in danger of losing hold over his domain. In the Year of Silent Shadows (1436 DR), he renounced his faith in Shar and begged Selûne&rsquo;s forgiveness for the destruction of her temple and its followers. In a desperate act of redemption, the death knight destroyed his undead form using a <wc-fetch type=item>sun blade</wc-fetch>. A vampire cleric of Shar named Keresta Delvingstone has ruled Vanrakdoom ever since.</p>
<p>With the shadow of Vanrak faded from memory, House Moonstar has prospered. The Waterdavian family is currently overseen by the once shrewd but now senile Lady Wylynd Moonstar, a venerable human noblewoman who, by last estimate, is well over a century old. Although she has no children of her own, Wylynd is surrounded by distant relatives, including a savvy half-drow grandnephew named Helion Moonstar, whom she has chosen to be her heir. The family&rsquo;s business interests lie in cartography and exploration, and Wylynd has been known to fund expeditions to Undermountain from time to time for reasons she prefers to keep to herself.</p>

Hoping to make a better life for herself, she became an adventurer and sought fame and fortune in Undermountain. Keresta met her end in the lair of a vampire and became avampire spawn under its command.</p>
<p>After Vanrak destroyed the vampire and conquered its lair, he took Keresta under his wing. Consumed by darkness and loss, Keresta was drawn to Shar like a moth to a flame and rose to become a vampire cleric of the evil god. She now leads Shar&rsquo;s debased cult in Vanrakdoom and intends to send the group on a mission to destroy the Spires of the Morning, the temple of Lathander (god of birth and renewal) in Waterdeep. She also has her sights set on destroying the House of the Moon—Waterdeep&rsquo;s temple of Selûne, whom she blames for the destruction of Vanrak Moonstar.</p>
<p>Keresta is a vampire, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keresta summons Giant Centipede instead of wolves.</li>
<li>She gains the Spellcasting feature described below.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fog creeps into areas of dim light or darkness. It vanishes when light is brought to bear on it but reappears when the light passes. A permanent fog hangs in some areas regardless of light, as noted in the descriptions of those areas.</li>
<li>Rats and bats are plentiful. In areas where they are not specifically mentioned, droppings and guano betray their presence, and they can be heard constantly scuttling and shrieking in the distant darkness.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Keresta is destroyed, the fog disperses, and the rats and bats gradually die off until only a scattered few remain.</p>

Fond of assuming human form, Glyster was Vanrak Moonstar&rsquo;s friend and companion, remaining by the noble&rsquo;s side even after Vanrak&rsquo;s fall from grace. Glyster tried to turn Vanrak away from the worship of Shar, to no avail, and the dragon sank into despair. In this forlorn state, he allowed Shar&rsquo;s priests to transform him into a shadow dragon to better serve Vanrak in the battles to come. Thereafter, Glyster became known as Umbraxakar (&ldquo;shadowborn&rdquo; in Draconic).</p>
<p>The death knight and the shadow dragon fought side by side for many years, expanding their domain and then defending it against adventurers and other invaders. By this time, Umbraxakar had stopped caring about anything except his friendship with Vanrak. The friendship finally ended when Vanrak destroyed himself with a <wc-fetch type=item>sun blade</wc-fetch>, leaving Umbraxakar and the remnants of Shar&rsquo;s wicked cult to fend for themselves.</p>

These visions, byproducts of Umbraxakar&rsquo;s despair, provide clues that can help free the dragon from his dark curse. A character does not experience such visions within an antimagic field or while under the protection of a <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel evil and good</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>Characters also encounter magical projections of Umbraxakar. These shadowy images take the form of harmless, dragon-shaped clouds of black fog. A projection that is targeted by a <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell or touched by an antimagic field is destroyed instantly. It otherwise cannot be harmed.</p>

Living cultists also find their way here from time to time, guided through Undermountain by the dark grace of Shar herself. Keresta turns the most promising acolytes into vampire spawn. Those deemed unworthy of Shar&rsquo;s blessing nourish Keresta and her spawn with their blood, after which Umbraxakar devours the exsanguinated corpses.</p>
<p>Cultists are neutral evil humans who wear dusty gray robes over their armor. These robes bear the symbol of Shar: a black circle bordered in dark purple.</p>

In these areas, bright light is reduced to dim light, and dim light to darkness. In addition, all color has been drained from these areas, and a deathly stench hangs in the air. The walls are severely cracked, the floor tiles are buckled and broken in numerous places, and the ceilings have begun to sag as though they won&rsquo;t remain in place much longer.</p>
<p>Areas within the Shadowfell are no longer part of Undermountain and therefore aren&rsquo;t subject to its magical restrictions (see &ldquo;<strong>area Alterations to Magic</strong>").</p>
<p>The shadow dragon&rsquo;s despair can cause other areas of Vanrakdoom to slide in and out of the Shadowfell at irregular intervals—sometimes for a few seconds or minutes, sometimes for hours. Any such shift happens at your discretion and lasts as long as you want. When an area slides into the Shadowfell, all colors and lights within the area become muted as described above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Purple Flames</strong>. The walls are lined with rusty iron sconces, each holding a torch coated in black wax that burns with a purple flame.</p>
<p><strong>Cult Ritual</strong>. Six human Cultist of Shar kneel on rough woven mats in the center of this area, chanting in low tones. A human cult fanatic engulfed in a swarm of rats stands quietly in their midst.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kneeling cultists are named Caradoc, Feldar, Hong, Khafra, Serenade, and Xandeval. They are chanting the following verse over and over in Common: &ldquo;Darkness quench the sun. Darkness swallow the moon. We are nothing but the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keresta Delvingstone is using the swarm of rats to test the cult fanatic, whose name is Jian. To pass the test, Jian must allow the rats to crawl over his body without fear or protest, or else they will devour him. Only by passing this test can Jian qualify to become one of Keresta&rsquo;s vampire spawn.</p>
<p>The arrival of intruders prompts the cultists to take up arms and attack. Jian, however, does nothing while the rats swarm over him. If he takes damage, Jian panics and is swiftly devoured by the rats. If the swarm loses more than half its hit points, it scatters and flees.</p>

Shadow Vigil</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Double Door</strong>. Carved into the double door to the north are two figures: a skeletal warrior clutching the bladeless hilt of a sword on the left door, and a handsome young man with dragon wings on the right door. Above the double door is a 3-foot-diameter disk painted black with a purple metal rim (the symbol of Shar).</p>
<p><strong>Cultists and Rats</strong>. Twelve human Cultist of Shar are chanting outside the doors. Crawling around their feet are four Swarm of Rats.</p>
<p><strong>Purple Flames</strong>. Mounted on the back walls of four wide alcoves are rusty iron sconces, each holding a torch coated in black wax that burns with a purple flame. The walls of the alcoves are cracked and pitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rats attack creatures not dressed as cultists of Shar. The cultists are chanting to help focus the power of the ritual taking place in area 10, and they try to kill anyone they believe is not a Shar worshiper. They chant the following verse over and over in Common: &ldquo;Darkness quench the sun. Darkness swallow the moon. Darkness claim this dungeon and all that dwell within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that the ritual in area 10 must not be disturbed, the cultists do everything they can to prevent the doors to that area from being opened. If characters enter through the double door, the cultists assume the ritual has already been interrupted and attack immediately.</p>

Ritual Chamber</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Purple Flames</strong>. Black wax candles set in niches along the walls of this 20-foot-high room burn with a purple flame, filling the room with dim light.</p>
<p><strong>Cult Ritual</strong>. Six Cult Fanatic are chanting in unison. Each one stands next to a black stone pillar and is focused on a roiling fog cloud, 8 feet in diameter, that floats at the center of the room 10 feet above the floor. Lines of black energy run between the pillars and the cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cult fanatics are named Abberoch, Belora, Liana, Shanzo, Torfiana, and Uzalyn. They are performing a ritual designed to anchor one of Umbraxakar&rsquo;s memories to this room, which will enable the shadow dragon to pull more of Vanrakdoom into the Shadowfell. They chant the following verse over and over in Common: &ldquo;Darkness quench the sun. Darkness swallow the moon. Darkness claim this dungeon and all that dwell within.&rdquo; If attacked, they continue to chant while also defending themselves.</p>
<p>Killing a cult fanatic deactivates one of the pillars, destroying the line of energy emanating from it and weakening the ritual. When all six lines of energy are destroyed, the fog cloud vanishes.</p>
<p>As long as at least one column is active, characters see a faint image in the cloud of an adult bronze dragon surrounded by figures in black robes wearing the holy symbol of Shar and reading from scrolls. As the great creature writhes in pain, its bronze scales begin to darken.</p>
<p>The lines of black energy between the pillars and the cloud are 10 feet above the floor and easily avoided. Any creature that comes into contact with one takes 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) necrotic damage from it.</p>

<p>This room contains all the supplies and tools needed to create black wax candles and torches, including flasks of oil, ceramic crucibles, and wooden candle molds. The supplies and tools rest on wooden tables spaced haphazardly about the room.</p>

Slumped in a stone throne, he says, &ldquo;Is this to be the legacy of Vanrak Moonstar? A shadow king damned to rule these moonless halls, fending off assassins, mad wizards, and ghosts of the ancient dead? Is this all that Shar has to offer?

<p><strong>Fountains</strong>. Alcoves to the west and east contain stone fountains, each carved to look like a perched bronze dragon spouting water into an ornate stone basin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fountains are fed by an underground spring and flow with clean, cool water. The living inhabitants of Vanrakdoom depend on this water for their survival.</p>
<p>A fountain&rsquo;s 4-foot-tall dragon sculpture can be broken off with a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check and used to activate the arch gate in this room. Each sculpture is a Small object that weighs 500 pounds.</p>

<ul>
<li>The gate opens for 1 minute when a real or illusory dragon touches the arch. An artistic rendering of a dragon, such as a dragon-shaped figurine or a drawing of a dragon, also opens the gate.</li>
<li>Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

A hollow voice (that of Lord Vanrak Moonstar) issues a terrible command: &ldquo;Umbraxakar, give these fools the death they deserve!&rdquo; A cone of necrotic energy erupts from the character as the shadow dragon engulfs the nearest prisoner, a male dwarf stripped of gear, with its breath weapon.

Shadow&rsquo;s Edge</h3><p>Two tunnels converge on a 20-foot-high chamber that contains the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Two 12-foot-tall obsidian statues stand atop 5-foot-high blocks of stone in alcoves, facing one another. Each statue depicts a faceless robed woman holding a silver thread taut between her outstretched hands.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow Curtain</strong>. A thin, translucent curtain of shadow stretches between the statues, rippling like black cloth in a light breeze.</p>
<p><strong>Locked Double Door</strong>. Beyond the shadowy curtain is a 12-foot-tall arched double door with an ornate carving of a bronze dragon above it, its wings forming the door frame. Draconic letters are carved into the floor in front of the double door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around each strand of silver thread. The threads can be cut only by a magic sword. Cutting a thread causes it to disappear but also causes an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>") to momentarily appear between the statue&rsquo;s hands. This elder rune specifically targets the creature that cut the thread. To determine which rune appears, draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B). The shadow curtain disappears when both silver threads are cut.</p>
<p>The rippling curtain of shadow that stretches between the two statues extends from floor to ceiling and radiates a strong aura of necromantic magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell. The statues are flush with the walls behind them, so circumventing the curtain is not possible.</p>
<p>Any creature that moves through the curtain must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The greater danger of the curtain is less obvious: if the double door is forced open, six Wraith emerge from the curtain and attack, pursuing creatures that flee. A wraith that has nothing to attack on its turn enters the shadow curtain and vanishes. The wraiths don&rsquo;t appear once the curtain disappears.</p>

A silver rod with a key-shaped end, which can be found in <strong>area areas 10</strong> and <strong>area 13b</strong>, fits into this keyhole perfectly. Using a light source to cast the shadow of a rod-key onto the doors causes them to swing open, allowing access to <strong>area area 19</strong>. It is this shadow, not the key itself, that unlocks the doors. Unless they are held open, the doors close and lock on their own after being open for 1 minute. The doors are not locked from the other side and can be opened from <strong>area area 19</strong> without a rod-key.</p>
<p>The locked doors can also be opened with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic, or forced open with a successful DC 28 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

Hall of Death</h3><p>Characters entering this hall for the first time feel as though they&rsquo;ve crossed a planar threshold of some kind, but a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check is needed to confirm that this part of the dungeon resides in the Shadowfell. All color has been drained from this hall, which greets visitors with the stench of death (see &ldquo;<strong>area Into the Shadowfell</strong>"). The hall&rsquo;s other features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ceiling</strong>. The ceiling is arched and 30 feet high.</p>
<p><strong>Skulls and Bones</strong>. Old skulls and bones (the remains of dead adventurers and monsters) have been swept into alcoves along the hall&rsquo;s southern stretch.</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>. Any character who opens a door leading west or east experiences one of the shadow dragon&rsquo;s visions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the bones are disturbed, a giant spectral mouth with fangs appears, floating 10 feet in front of the double door to the south. It recites the following verse in Common before disappearing:</p>
<p>Welcome to Umbraxakar&rsquo;s lair.</p>
<p>A dragon held in the grip of despair</p>
<p>Conjures memories of his departed friend:</p>
<p>Upon sunlight&rsquo;s blade, he met his end.</p>

The brawl ends when the man is knocked to the floor, stumbles to his feet, draws the bronzed hilt of a <wc-fetch type=item>sun blade</wc-fetch> that suddenly burns with radiance, and says, &ldquo;Remember this? Your gift to me? Challenge me again, and I&rsquo;ll carve out that big heart of yours and eat it!&rdquo; The viewer&rsquo;s perspective changes as the character transforms into a bronze dragon and says in Common, &ldquo;Vanrak! I am your friend. Listen to me. She&rsquo;s using the pain of your father&rsquo;s death to lead you down the darkest of all paths. For the love of Selûne, do not follow her!&rdquo; With that, the vision ends.</p>

Pantry</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Mold</strong>. Black mold clings to the walls, and the air is heavy with the scent of rot.</p>
<p><strong>Prisoner</strong>. A human adventurer named Portia Dzuth is chained up to the north. Her armor and equipment lie in a heap to the south.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Portia Dzuth hails from Rashemen. She is the sole survivor of an adventuring party hired by Lady Wylynd Moonstar of Waterdeep to find Umbraxakar the shadow dragon and transform him back into Glyster the bronze dragon, friend of House Moonstar. Portia thinks Umbraxakar&rsquo;s curse can be undone by ridding the dragon of its despair, but she has no idea how to accomplish this. She and her companions were captured less than a month ago, but Portia has lost track of time and believes she has been imprisoned in Vanrakdoom for much longer. Thevampire spawn feed on Portia whenever blood is in short supply, and she has the bite marks to prove it. After each feeding, Keresta charms Portia to keep her calm and under control.</p>
<p>A character can free Portia from her shackles using the key in <strong>area area 25a</strong>, or by picking the lock with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A character can also free Portia by snapping her chains with a successful DC 30 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>Portia sank into madness and despair after she was forced to watch Umbraxakar devour the corpses of her slain companions one by one. She stays close to her rescuers, serving as a loyal follower until she is safely out of Undermountain or until Keresta asks her to betray them. While fighting on the party&rsquo;s side, Portia claims an equal share of all XP gained. She is a champion (see appendix A), with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Portia is lawful neutral and speaks Common.</li>
<li>She is magically <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> by Keresta and regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect wears off in 12 hours unless Keresta charms her again.</li>
<li>She suffers from Shadowfell despair manifesting as unshakable dread. Until the despair ends, she has disadvantage on all saving throws and gains the following flaw: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that I&rsquo;m going to die in Vanrakdoom.&rdquo; She can attempt to end her despair each time she finishes a long rest, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. A <wc-fetch type=spell>calm emotions</wc-fetch> spell also ends her despair, as does any spell or other magical effect that removes a curse.</li>
</ul>

Vampire Boss</h3><p>If the characters haven&rsquo;t already encountered and defeated Keresta Delvingstone, she&rsquo;s here when they arrive (see &ldquo;<strong>area Keresta Delvingstone</strong>"). The vampire is not alone. The room&rsquo;s features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ceiling</strong>. The 30-foot-high ceiling is supported by two thick stone columns that have rusty iron torch brackets mounted to them.</p>
<p><strong>Vampires in the Fog</strong>. The floor is heavily obscured by a 2-foot-deep blanket of fog. Nine vampire spawn crawl under the fog and try to remain hidden until Keresta commands them to attack.</p>
<p><strong>Keresta Delvingstone</strong>. Keresta looks like a pale woman with a large dragon tattoo imprinted on her pale skin. She stands in the middle of the room, studying a large piece of parchment spread across a wooden table in front of her. Looming behind her is Thagor, an 18-foot-tall abominable yeti that serves as her protector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The haughty Keresta welcomes the characters to their doom and promises them a swift death. If asked about Lord Vanrak Moonstar or Umbraxakar, Keresta laughs and says that Shar&rsquo;s darkness consumes all things in the end.</p>
<p>If reduced to 0 hit points, Keresta turns to mist and retreats to her resting place in <strong>area area 31</strong> (via <strong>area area 30</strong>). In mist form, she can pass through the cracks under doors and blend in with the fog to become effectively <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>The abominable yeti and thevampire spawn fight to the death to protect Keresta, as does Portia Dzuth (see <strong>area area 25b</strong>) if she is present and still <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> by Keresta. The squad ofvampire spawn is composed of adventurers and cultists who have been turned into undead by Keresta. Their names are Aryk, Bartho, Callia, Gaston, Hector, Ilsuban, Nath, Rhylzar, and Rose.</p>
<p>The parchment on the table is a map of Waterdeep, drained of color like everything else in this part of Vanrakdoom. A quill pen and several ink pots rest nearby. Two daggers stuck in the map mark the Spires of the Morning (the temple of Lathander in the Castle Ward) and the House of the Moon (the temple of Selûne in the Sea Ward). Written around them are the names of various clerics and paladins of Lathander and Selûne whom Keresta plans to assassinate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shadows</strong>. The 40-foot-high vaulted ceiling is buttressed by eight stone columns, around which gather eleven Shadow and four Shadow Assassin (see appendix A) under Umbraxakar&rsquo;s command. (These undead act immediately after the dragon in the initiative count.)</p>
<p><strong>Dragon&rsquo;s Dais</strong>. To the south, stone steps climb 10 feet to a dais, where Umbraxakar is perched.</p>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. A double door at the back of the dais is flanked by two 20-foot-tall, black marble statues, one depicting Shar as a cloaked woman wielding a dagger in each hand and the other showing Halaster Blackcloak clutching a staff.

<ul>
<li>Umbraxakar is neutral evil.</li>
<li>He has resistance to necrotic damage. While in dim light or darkness, he has resistance to all damage that isn&rsquo;t force, psychic, or radiant, and he can take the <wc-fetch type=action>Hide</wc-fetch> action as a bonus action.</li>
<li>His <wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch> skill modifier is +10.</li>
<li>While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li>His Lightning Breath becomes Shadow Breath, dealing necrotic damage instead of lightning damage. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts immediately after Umbraxakar in the initiative count. The shadow is under Umbraxakar&rsquo;s control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Umbraxakar and the shadows under his command try to destroy intruders as quickly as possible, enabling the shadow dragon to revel in their misery rather than his own.</p>

As the dragon ages and becomes more powerful, his despair causes Vanrakdoom to sink deeper into the Shadowfell. Halaster has made no effort to prevent this from happening because it intrigues him to see part of Undermountain pulled away in such a manner. He&rsquo;s happy to let adventurers kill the dragon and return Umbraxakar&rsquo;s shadowy domain to Undermountain where it belongs.</p>
<p>Characters can try to turn Umbraxakar back into a bronze dragon by ending his despair and breaking Shar&rsquo;s hold over him. To accomplish this, they must present the shadow dragon with items he cherishes and succeed on three separate ability checks to lift his spirits (see below). If they fail more than one such check, they won&rsquo;t have enough gifts left to turn the shadow dragon back into a bronze dragon.</p>
<p>As an action, a character can give Umbraxakar a gift that holds emotional significance for the dragon. Four such items can be found in Vanrakdoom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vanrak&rsquo;s polished coral ring in <strong>area area 5</strong> (a symbol of friendship)</li>
<li>Vanrak&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=item>sun blade</wc-fetch> in <strong>area area 8</strong> (a symbol of light)</li>
<li>Vanrak&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=item>mithral armor</wc-fetch> in <strong>area area 15</strong> (a symbol of preservation and resilience)</li>
<li>The gold horn in <strong>area area 17</strong> (a symbol of guilt)</li>
</ul>
<p>While gifting one of these items, the character must speak sympathetic words to the dragon and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check. Other characters can&rsquo;t help on this check; it is made with advantage, however, if the character claims to be an emissary of House Moonstar or refers to the dragon by his true name, Glyster. If the character tries to deceive the dragon in any way, replace the <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch> check with a DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check. On a failed check, the dragon is not swayed by the characters' words but still keeps the gift.</p>
<p>With each successful check, the dragon becomes visibly more conflicted as moonlight magically flickers across his scales, making them appear more solid and less translucent. A character who sees this magical moonlight can sense, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check, that it&rsquo;s of divine origin. (The moonlight is a blessing from Selûne, though there&rsquo;s no way for the characters to confirm this.)</p>
<p>Three successful checks are needed to rid the dragon of his despair, whereupon he dismisses any remaining undead under his command, causing them to vanish and never return. His spirits lifted by the characters' gifts and words, Umbraxakar changes back into an adult bronze dragon, returns the characters' gifts, and insists on being called Glyster henceforth. He offers to help the characters clear out the rest of Vanrakdoom as well as to explore deeper levels of Undermountain in the hope of finding a gate that he can use to escape from Undermountain. Glyster would like to take his collected treasures with him (see <strong>area area 33</strong>) and offers the characters a few choice items if they help him transport the hoard.</p>
<p>Glyster is an archetypal bronze dragon who likes to assume a variety of humanoid and beast forms. For roleplaying guidance, see the &ldquo;Bronze Dragon&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual.</p>

The light-dimming effect of the Shadowfell is also lifted, and natural colors are restored, but the stench of death lingers (see &ldquo;<strong>area Into the Shadowfell</strong>"). The fog encountered throughout Vanrakdoom is not a byproduct of Umbraxakar&rsquo;s despair and remains until Keresta is destroyed.</p>

<h5 id=north-statue>
<a href=#north-statue class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>North Statue</h5><p>This painted wooden statue, 8 feet tall, depicts Keresta Delvingstone with her claws outstretched and her fangs bared. Around its neck, the statue wears a large ruby pendant on a gold chain (750 gp), and draped over its shoulders is a <wc-fetch type=item>cloak of the bat</wc-fetch>. Piled around the base are 13,700 sp.</p>
<h5 id=south-statue>
<a href=#south-statue class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>South Statue</h5><p>This wooden statue, 10 feet tall, depicts Umbraxakar in humanoid form, appearing as a muscular man with charcoal-colored skin, bronze-colored eyes, and dragon wings. Piled around the statue are 9,300 gp.</p>
<h5 id=west-statue>
<a href=#west-statue class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>West Statue</h5><p>This stone statue stands 9 feet tall and is painted jet black. It depicts Shar as a cloaked woman with a dagger in each hand. A character who searches the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check discovers that one of its daggers is a lever that opens a compartment at the base of the statue. The compartment contains a rolled-up painting of Shar (250 gp) and a vial containing 2 doses of <wc-fetch type=item>midnight tears</wc-fetch> (see &ldquo;Poisons&rdquo; in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Piled around the statue&rsquo;s base are 22,150 ep.</p>
<h2 id=aftermath>
<a href=#aftermath class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Aftermath</h2><p>Destroying Keresta Delvingstone puts one last nail in the coffin of the cult of Shar. Any remaining cultists andvampire spawn disperse like rats fleeing a sinking ship. Several months later, the characters (if they&rsquo;re still alive) receive the deed to a run-down estate in Waterdeep worth 15,000 gp along with an official property transfer notice signed by a magistrate and authorized by the Lords of Waterdeep.</p>
<p>Accompanying the deed is a brief letter written in human blood that thanks the characters for destroying Keresta Delvingstone, whom the letter&rsquo;s writer describes as a &ldquo;thorn in my side for more than a century.&rdquo; The letter is signed with the initials &ldquo;A.M.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several Masked Lords of Waterdeep use every resource at their disposal to discourage and thwart investigations into the letter writer&rsquo;s identity. With enough luck and patience, however, characters might come to learn that &ldquo;A.M.&rdquo; stands for Artor Morlin, the Baron of Blood, a powerful vampire who dwells in a dungeon complex under Waterdeep and can&rsquo;t abide other vampires preying on his city. The baron&rsquo;s presence is one of Waterdeep&rsquo;s most closely guarded secrets.</p>
<p>Freeing Umbraxakar from his curse completes a quest (see &ldquo;<strong>area Save the Dragon</strong>") and earns the characters the friendship of a powerful bronze dragon eager to leave Undermountain and return to his coastal lair, helping the characters as he goes.</p>
<p>Halaster doesn&rsquo;t mourn the loss of the shadow dragon or the cult of Shar. He simply cordons off large sections of Vanrakdoom until he can restock them with new monsters and traps.</p>
