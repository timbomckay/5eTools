<p>The Sargauth Level is designed for four 7th-level characters, and characters who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 8th level. This level of Undermountain is connected to the subterranean settlement of Skullport by way of tunnels, as well as the River Sargauth itself (see &ldquo;Skullport&rdquo;). More ancient than Skullport is the town of Stromkuhldur, whose ruins lie half-buried in the heart of the Sargauth Level. Goblinoids and drow vie for control of these ruins, which were previously inhabited by the Netherese and the Melairkyn dwarves.</p>

Since then, many factions have fought over this outpost. Currently the drow of House Auvryndar and the goblinoids of the Legion of Azrok are teetering on the brink of a war that Halaster and the Xanathar Guild both seek to foment.</p>

Under T&rsquo;rissa&rsquo;s command, the drow have begun secret experiments using humanoids as incubators for giant spider eggs.</p>

Such a curse would ordinarily have spelled his doom in hobgoblin society, but Azrok&rsquo;s mother was a sorcerer, and she refused to allow her son&rsquo;s misfortune to dictate his destiny. She crafted a <wc-fetch type=item>dagger of blindsight</wc-fetch>, which young Azrok used to defend himself and perceive his surroundings. The dagger allowed Azrok to become the powerful soldier and leader he was fated to be, and he was quickly promoted up through the ranks until none stood above him. Other goblinoids believed he was blessed by Maglubiyet, the great god of war. Azrok wisely hid the true source of his &ldquo;godsight&rdquo; to perpetuate the myth.</p>
<p>Age granted Azrok wisdom and the desire to carve out a domain of his own. He led his forces to Stromkuhldur, and they rid the place of grimlocks and troglodytes that dwelled there. He sired an heir, ensuring that his legacy would last beyond his lifetime. His son, Azrokkog, chafed at his father&rsquo;s sedentary nature and left to wage wars of his own, eventually returning to Undermountain with a new name—Doomcrown—and a new purpose (see &ldquo;Level 14: Arcturiadoom&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Legion of Azrok, which has lived in Stromkuhldur for three decades, is in turmoil. Azrok was recently forced to give up a portion of his domain to encroaching drow, and did so with nary a fight. This has sent shock waves through his legion. What caused this strange lack of courage in their great warlord? Has age finally taken its toll?</p>
<p>In reality, a band of duergar thieves posing as merchants recently stole Azrok&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=item>dagger of blindsight</wc-fetch> and fled using their invisibility. News of the theft reached the drow of House Auvryndar and spurred them to take over the eastern section of Stromkuhldur. Lurkana, Azrok&rsquo;s wife and strongest captain, tried to cover up her husband&rsquo;s blindness, but her efforts were undone by a mind flayer acting as Skullport&rsquo;s ambassador. This mind flayer secretly implanted intellect devourers in the skulls of several goblins in Azrok&rsquo;s court, and these goblins are spreading the truth of Azrok&rsquo;s blindness throughout Stromkuhldur to further besmirch his reputation and demoralize his troops.</p>
<p>The hobgoblins under Azrok remain loyal to him, but many of the goblins and bugbears have fled to Skullport to join the Xanathar Guild. Compounding Azrok&rsquo;s and Lurkana&rsquo;s woes is the likelihood that House Auvryndar is planning another attack to seize more territory. Fears of a Xanathar Guild offensive emerging from Skullport also play in the back of Azrok&rsquo;s mind. Meanwhile, Lurkana searches for aid in finding the duergar thieves who stole the <wc-fetch type=item>dagger of blindsight</wc-fetch> and returning it to her.</p>

After Azrok guarantees their safety in his settlement, Lurkana takes them aside and offers a reward for the safe return of her husband&rsquo;s magic dagger. She emphasizes that without the dagger, the invading drow and the Xanathar Guild might conquer Stromkuhldur and become immensely more powerful. She reminds the adventurers that the Legion of Azrok has never once threatened Waterdeep—but the drow or the guild might leap at the chance to do just that.</p>
<p>Lurkana knows that the thieves who stole the dagger are duergar of Clan Ironeye, and she thinks they might be hiding in Skullport. (Characters who make discreet inquiries in Skullport can learn that a large contingent of duergar from Clan Ironeye resupplied in Skullport and drank ale at a local tavern called the Black Tankard before heading deeper into Undermountain. The tavern&rsquo;s tight-lipped duergar proprietor, Droon Stonedark, denies everything. The characters can catch up to the duergar of Clan Ironeye on level 6.)</p>
<p>If the characters accept her quest, Lurkana suggests they search Skullport first and points them in the right direction (beyond <strong>area area 23</strong>). She also suggests that they speak with Skullport&rsquo;s ambassador to Stromkuhldur (the mind flayer in <strong>area area 21g</strong>) to see if it knows anything. She cautions them not to harm the ambassador in any way, so as not to fray relations any further.</p>
<p><strong>Reward:</strong> In exchange for the dagger, Lurkana is prepared to pay 1,000 gp delivered in a locked chest along with the key. If the characters demand more, she is willing to increase the payment to 1,500 gp and throw in two bugbears and five goblins as bodyguards and scouts. Unknown to Lurkana, two of the goblins have intellect devourers in their skulls and act as secret spies for Xanathar. The bugbears and other goblins serve the adventurers well, but being evil and greedy, they become increasingly difficult to control over time.</p>

Catacombs</h3><p>These catacombs are part of a temple complex formerly dedicated to the dwarven god Dumathoin, patron of mining and exploration and the protector of the dwarven dead. The catacombs have the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Carvings</strong>. The smooth-carved walls bear engraved imagery of mountains marbled with veins of glittering minerals, and the marble floor is caked in dust.</p>
<p><strong>Tombs</strong>. Shelf-like niches carved into the walls are stacked three high. Each of these open tombs contains the dust-covered bones of a long-dead dwarf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dwarves laid to rest here were all worshipers of Dumathoin. Characters who search each shelf also find fragments of metal armor so old that they turn to dust at the lightest touch, as well as tiny stone beads with holes bored through them. A character who inspects the beads and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check recalls that ancient dwarves braided the beards of their dead using these stone beads.</p>

<p>Web-covered areas count as difficult terrain, but they&rsquo;re not strong enough to restrain anyone. A character can use an action to burn a 5-foot cube of web with a torch or to cast a spell that deals fire damage, which clears all the webs in the spell&rsquo;s area.</p>

<p>The drow feed wandering goblins to the phase spiders.

Temple of Dumathoin</h3><p>This ancient temple of Dumathoin has been converted into a vile hatchery for giant spiders by T&rsquo;rissa Auvryndar and her followers. It contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dais</strong>. T&rsquo;rissa Auvryndar, a drow priestess of Lolth, stands atop a raised dais at the back of the hall, presiding over a group of four drow (two females named Ardulace and Dhessril, and two males named Izzatlab and Yriltorn) and three Giant Spider. If the characters didn&rsquo;t encounter the drow mage in <strong>area area 5a</strong>, he is present as well.</p>
<p><strong>Spiders</strong>. Scores of tarantula-sized baby giant Spider creep and crawl throughout the room. (Unless they&rsquo;re destroyed, most of them will mature into full-size giant spiders in a matter of weeks.)</p>
<p><strong>Web Cocoons</strong>. Stone pillars hold up the 30-foot-high arched ceiling, which is concealed by a thick canopy of spiderwebs. Strung between the pillars and bas-relief carvings of towering dwarves protruding from the walls are humanoid corpses cocooned in spider silk.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrifice</strong>. The back wall of the temple is carved with a towering bas-relief of a mountain. Lashed to the mountain with sticky webs is a struggling and gagged male drow with sacks of spider eggs clinging to his body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>T&rsquo;rissa is as malevolent as the demonic god she worships and refuses to speak to non-drow, let alone negotiate with them. T&rsquo;rissa stabilizes dying characters so that they can be implanted with spider eggs (see &ldquo;Spider Eggs&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The male drow lashed to the wall is named Krenrak. He was T&rsquo;rissa&rsquo;s consort until she grew bored with him. If set free, he fights against T&rsquo;rissa and the other drow—but baby spiders burst from his chest 2 rounds after his release, killing him.</p>
<p>T&rsquo;rissa carries a ring of iron keys that unlock the cells in <strong>area area 5d</strong>, as well as a separate iron key to <strong>area area 20d</strong>.</p>

Narizmar actually spread rumors of the affair himself, so that Sylkress would torture him and thereby see his value. In short, the two are enjoying themselves at each other&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>If he must, Narizmar can free himself from the leather straps with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Sleight of Hand</wc-fetch>) check. Once free, he tries to arm himself. He obeys Sylkress above all others and would willingly sacrifice his life to save hers.</p>
<p>Sylkress defends herself, but if she is reduced to half her hit points or fewer, she calls for mercy and supplies characters with the following information in exchange for her freedom:</p>
<ul>
<li>The drow invasion of the Sargauth Level is just a precursor to a full-scale attack on Skullport.</li>
<li>Sylkress&rsquo;s older sister, T&rsquo;rissa, is breeding giant spiders to bolster the drow forces on this level (see <strong>area area 6</strong>). T&rsquo;rissa believes her experimental new incubation method will create larger and more formidable spiders.</li>
<li>Sylkress&rsquo;s twin sister, Melith, has taken a small force down to the Twisted Caverns (level 4) to establish a presence on that level.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Drow</strong>. A large, rotating platform with leather straps takes up most of the room. Pellanonia is strapped to the platform while Ghirith lashes her with a scourge.</p>
<p><strong>Gear</strong>. Lying on a chair in the northeast corner are Pellanonia&rsquo;s armor and weapons.</p>

<p>Pellanonia and Ghirith are lovers. If she must, Pellanonia can slip free of her bonds with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Sleight of Hand</wc-fetch>) check. Once free, she tries to arm herself. As a daughter of House Auvryndar, she uses her status in the house as a shield, claiming that she&rsquo;s worth more alive than dead. If captured or cornered, she is willing to divulge the following information in exchange for her freedom:</p>
<ul>
<li>House Auvryndar&rsquo;s main stronghold in Undermountain is in Muiral&rsquo;s Gauntlet (level 10) and is under the direct command of her mother, Vlonwelv.</li>
<li>Her oldest sister, T&rsquo;rissa, has orders from their mother to secure the Sargauth Level as a prelude to a full-scale attack on Skullport.</li>
<li>Another of her older sisters, Melith, has gained a foothold in the Twisted Caverns (level 4) and is waging a campaign of violence against the kuo-toa on that level.</li>

Sea Hag Coven</h4><p>This 30-foot-high natural cave smells like brine and seaweed. It is home to a coven of three Sea Hag in league with Halaster Blackcloak. Each hag has a giant crab pet that follows her around and obeys her commands. The cave&rsquo;s other features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Noise</strong>. The sound of splashing geysers (see <strong>area area 10d</strong>) echoes throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Pools</strong>. The uneven floor has many shallow pits filled with dirty water. The hags use these pits as baths and hide in them if they see lights approaching or hear unfamiliar footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>Decor</strong>. A vast variety of shells are embedded in the slick, algae-coated walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters previously met with Anderian Dusk, the lantern merchant of Skullport, the sea hags are already acquainted with them thanks to the <em>hag eye</em> pendant that Dusk wears. In this case, they address the characters in familiar tones and ask them if they took time to sample some of Skullport&rsquo;s local ales. Otherwise, they politely introduce themselves as Coral Black, Gurgle Brine, and Caldra Cuttlefingers.</p>
<p>While all three hags are alive, they gain the Shared Spellcasting trait, as described in the &ldquo;Hag Covens&rdquo; sidebar in the &ldquo;Hags&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual. The hags aren&rsquo;t spoiling for a fight with non-drow, because Halaster has tasked them solely with ridding the Sargauth Level of the dark elves. The hags keep their affiliation with Halaster a secret and pretend to be harmless shell collectors with no enemies to speak of. They use adventurers to do their dirty work, promising not only safe passage through their caves but also information meant to turn them against the drow. Throughout the conversation, they supply the following observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;A drow priestess has defiled an ancient dwarven temple on the other side of the river, turning it into a profane breeding pit for spider abominations.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The drow are kidnapping folk from the city above. Those not fed to the spiders are sacrificed to the vile demon goddess worshiped by the drow.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The drow have already infiltrated Skullport and found its defenses lacking. An invasion is imminent. The capture of Skullport will give the drow a firm base from which to strike into the heart of Undermountain. What&rsquo;s next? Waterdeep?&rdquo;</li>

<p><strong>Cauldron</strong>. In the middle of this 20-foot-high cave, the floor bulges and forms a 5-foot-diameter stone cauldron.</p>
<p><strong>Decor</strong>. Ship rigging and tattered sails hang from the ceiling like web strands and torn curtains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stone cauldron, created by Halaster, is filled to the brim with murky water and has five rusty iron keys at the bottom. (These keys unlock the shackles in <strong>area area 10g</strong>.) The cauldron has AC 17, 60 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the cauldron cracks and is destroyed. The sea hags use the cauldron as a focus for their <wc-fetch type=spell>scrying</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>The first time a creature other than a sea hag disturbs the water or damages the cauldron, an elder rune materializes above it (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>"). Draw from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B) to determine which rune appears. The elder rune targets a random creature within 60 feet of it.</p>
<p>Any creature that drinks a pint or more of water from the cauldron must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> for 1 hour per pint consumed.</p>

Larder</h4><p>The sea hags shackle their food here. Old chains bolted to the walls end in five sets of rusty shackles, the keys to which are hidden inside the cauldron in <strong>area area 10e</strong>. A character with thieves' tools can pick each lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.</p>
<p>Two prisoners are chained here when the characters arrive: an unarmed goblin named Lerk and a 13-year-old boy named Delvin Stormshore (CG male Illuskan human commoner with no weapons).</p>
<p>The hags caught Delvin after he and a friend &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; a rowboat and used it to explore the sea caves near Skullport. When the sea hags attacked, Delvin&rsquo;s friend leaped out of the boat and managed to swim away, but Delvin wasn&rsquo;t so lucky. He&rsquo;s so cold and scared that he stammers when he tries to talk.</p>
<p>For its own amusement, the wicked goblin has been tormenting Delvin by threatening to eat him before the hags return. Since the boy can&rsquo;t see in the dark, he mistakes the bullying goblin for his jailer, not another prisoner. If rescued, Delvin insists that the characters call him &ldquo;Del&rdquo; and gladly offers to carry their gear for them.</p>
<p>Like most goblins, Lerk is a cowardly bully. He&rsquo;s very hungry and begs characters for food and freedom.</p>

Hags' Hoard</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Ceiling</strong>. This cave has a jagged, 30-foot-high ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Wreckage</strong>. A 20-foot-high mountain of rotted-out rowboats fills the back 40 feet of this damp cave. Jutting like needles from the mound are shattered, barnacle-covered spars that were once masts. At the top of the mountain of junk is a crow&rsquo;s nest that contains the sea hags' treasure (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p><strong>Wall Decor</strong>. Hanging from iron spikes pounded into the walls are dozens of captain&rsquo;s wheels plundered from sunken ships and festooned with skulls.</p>
<p><strong>Figurehead</strong>. Leaning against the south wall is a ship&rsquo;s figurehead carved in the form of a wailing banshee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rowboat wreckage is difficult terrain, and sections of it are <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> to collapse. Any creature that ends its turn on the wreckage must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>The waterlogged figurehead stands 8 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around it. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the figurehead renders it nonmagical. Unless its magic is dispelled, the banshee figurehead lets out a tremendous wail if any creature other than a sea hag approaches within 10 feet of the crow&rsquo;s nest. The banshee&rsquo;s wail echoes throughout the cavern and can be heard as far away as <strong>area area 10c</strong>. If the hags survive, they gather reinforcements from <strong>area areas 10a</strong> and <strong>area 10b</strong> and rush to defend their precious treasure.</p>

<p><strong>Statues</strong>. The main cave has a 40-foot-high ceiling filled with the <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> victims of a medusa that once lived here.

The Ghost of three human pirates named Algarr Grimtide, Liddie &ldquo;Slurtongue&rdquo; Peddlekant, and Fishbone Jim move in and out of the rocks, searching for buried treasure. They attack creatures they perceive as competitors and ignore any others.</p>
<p>The ghosts can&rsquo;t rest until they find hidden treasure. The characters can get the ghosts' attention by offering to lead them to a hidden hoard (such as the one in <strong>area area 9b</strong>) or to a location near the river where the characters have buried treasure themselves. The ghosts can follow the party or possess characters but can&rsquo;t stray more than 100 feet from the River Sargauth. Once they find what they&rsquo;re looking for, they cackle and dance about madly, then vanish forever. Characters who lay the ghosts to rest in this way should receive XP as if they had defeated them in combat.</p>

Ferryman&rsquo;s Rest</h4><p>This 20-foot-high cave abuts the River Sargauth and has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Door</strong>. An ornate stone door embedded in the northwest wall is flanked by bas-reliefs of helmed dwarves, their faces chipped away by vandals. An inscription carved into the door&rsquo;s molding has also been damaged, rendering it indecipherable.</p>
<p><strong>Ferry</strong>. A black gondola, its hull carved with leering eyes, is moored at the river&rsquo;s edge and ferried by a black-robed tiefling skeleton clutching a 10-foot pole, which it uses to guide the boat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gondola and the skeletal ferryman are all creations of Halaster. The gondola, which can hold up to seven Medium creatures and their gear, is a Large object with AC 11, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>
<p>The tiefling skeleton understands Common and Infernal, but can&rsquo;t speak. It plies the River Sargauth in whichever direction its riders want to go. When the characters reach their destination, the tiefling extends a bony hand, expecting a payment of one coin per passenger. If it doesn&rsquo;t receive the proper payment, both it and the boat fade away. Characters who destroy the skeleton or use an effect that turns undead against it can commandeer the gondola—but without its proper pilot, the ship is attacked whenever it enters a section of the river marked with a wavy arrow. Roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll> and consult the following table to determine the nature of the attackers:</p>

Hall of Stone</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Big Xorn</strong>. An unusually large xorn, 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide, sleeps soundly in the middle of the room. While asleep, the creature remains standing, its mouth and eyes closed, its arms hanging limply with knuckles scraping the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Stone Cubes</strong>. Twenty cubes of solid granite measuring 8 feet on a side are arranged about the chamber. One cube near the west wall, marked with an X on map 3, is fake (see &ldquo;Fake Cube&rdquo; below).</p>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Four unfinished statues situated around the room have piles of chipped stone around their bases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until it escaped captivity and hid here, the xorn was one of Halaster&rsquo;s prized pets, raised on a steady diet of magic gemstones to dramatically increase its size. It comes and goes by phasing through the walls, and it enjoys the quiet solitude that this chamber provides. A successful DC 16 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check allows a creature to cross the room quietly without waking the xorn, but the check is made with disadvantage if the creature is carrying coins or gemstones, since the xorn can detect such treasures by scent even while it is asleep. The discovery of intruders in its lair provokes its anger, causing it to attack.</p>
<p>The xorn has a challenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP) and the following changes to its statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The xorn is Large and has 103 (<wc-roll>9d10 + 54</wc-roll>) hit points.</li>
<li>Its Strength is 20 (+5), and its melee weapon attacks have a +8 bonus to hit. Its claw attacks have a reach of 10 feet and deal 9 (<wc-roll>1d8 + 5</wc-roll>) slashing damage on a hit, and its bite attack deals 22 (<wc-roll>5d6 + 5</wc-roll>) piercing damage on a hit.</li>
</ul>

A dwarf within 10 feet of the cube can tell at a glance what it&rsquo;s made of, as can a character who taps the cube with a hammer or a similar tool. Any creature weighing more than 50 pounds that stands on the cube falls into it as the plaster gives way underfoot.</p>
<p>The cube contains a chipped alabaster throne of elven design, sturdy in construction yet elegant in form. It is intricately carved to resemble bundled branches and twigs, with a tiny songbird perched on one end of its back. There used to be five carved songbirds perched atop the throne, but four have been broken off and lost.</p>
<p>The throne was carved by the elves of Illefarn, an ancient kingdom of the North. It disappeared from its capital (located where Waterdeep stands today) shortly before the kingdom&rsquo;s destruction 2,500 years ago. The Melairkyn dwarves found it in damaged condition and planned to return it to the elves as a gift after repairing it. Dwarven adventurers later found it and hid it in hopes of returning when they had a means of getting it out of the dungeon, but they didn&rsquo;t make it back. Finding the throne and informing Volo of its whereabouts completes a quest (see &ldquo;<strong>area Throne of the Coronal</strong>").</p>
<p>As one of the oldest surviving relics of Illefarn, the throne is priceless. It has two minor magical properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A creature sitting in the throne can&rsquo;t tell a lie.</li>
<li>The throne is surprisingly light for its size, weighing only 500 pounds.</li>

Any character who can see the gas spores can discern their true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>Nerozar has the statistics of a beholder zombie, but its Disintegration Ray is replaced with the following:</p>

It is <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> by the ray&rsquo;s telekinetic grip until the start of the zombie&rsquo;s next turn or until the zombie is <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>.If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn&rsquo;t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The zombie can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or container.</p>
<p>Nerozar uses its Telekinetic Ray to direct the gas spores on collision courses with intruders. The gas spores' poison has no effect on the beholder zombie.</p>
<p>Nerozar challenged Xanathar for lordship of Skullport and lost. Skullport&rsquo;s mind flayer ambassador (see <strong>area area 21g</strong>) brought Nerozar&rsquo;s animated corpse with it to Stromkuhldur, but Azrok wouldn&rsquo;t allow the beholder zombie to remain in the settlement, so the mind flayer left it here, where it sprouted the gas spores.</p>

Otyugh Lair</h4><p>This 10-foot-high side cavern is piled high with refuse and rotting corpses, under which hides an otyugh. The otyugh is a friend to the goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears of Azrok&rsquo;s Hold (<strong>area area 21</strong>), who supply it with plenty of carrion. It won&rsquo;t ordinarily attack goblinoids or anyone escorted by them. It will, however, attack any creature that dares to root through its garbage pile.</p>
<p>The corpses in the garbage pile are the remains of drow, quaggoths, bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins that were killed in skirmishes between the Legion of Azrok and House Auvryndar. The bodies have been stripped of all armor, weapons, and valuables, and some are missing chunks of flesh—a feast for the otyugh.</p>

Drow Town</h3><p>An ancient earthquake collapsed sections of Stromkuhldur, dividing the town into smaller caverns. After driving the Legion of Azrok out of this eastern cavern, the drow of House Auvryndar assumed control of it. The cavern has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ruins</strong>. The 30-foot-high cavern is a deathly quiet maze of crumbling stone buildings, many of which have partially collapsed. The buildings' walls are 10 feet high, and their roofs have mostly caved in.</p>
<p><strong>Webs and Spiders</strong>. Webs are strung between the buildings, but they&rsquo;re not thick enough to inhibit movement. Nine Giant Spider roam the alleys between the buildings in search of prey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The giant spiders creep about in groups of three. Additional forces stationed here include a male drow elite warrior named Ranaghax Auvryndar, twelve male drow, three grimlocks, and three quaggoths. If an alarm is raised, these forces gather with the giant spiders to seek out and destroy intruders.</p>
<p>Buildings not keyed on the map are assumed to be empty rooms. The rest are described below.</p>

<p><strong>Odor</strong>. The smell of meat stew wafts from this building.</p>
<p><strong>Servants and Guards</strong>. Inside, a manacled bugbear and three Goblin shackled together by the ankles are preparing meals under the watchful eye of three male drow guards named Raelphar, Rizryn, and Xebyl.</p>
<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. Stone counters are spread throughout the room. A large cauldron is hung above a fire in the southwest corner.</p>

<p>Raelphar carries a key to the bugbear&rsquo;s manacles, and Rizryn has a ring of keys that unlock the goblins' shackles. Without these keys, a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools opens each lock.</p>
<p>If released from captivity, the goblinoids arm themselves with improvised weapons and flee to <strong>area area 17a</strong> by way of the south tunnel. The bugbear&rsquo;s name is Blarg. The goblins' names are Globby, Bootlick, and Earstabber.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stuffed Heads</strong>. Mounted to the walls are the stuffed heads of several bugbears, hobgoblins, and goblins.</p>
<p><strong>Chest</strong>. A locked chest of dark wood, carved in the likeness of a spider with eyes of red crystal, rests in the western alcove. (The key to the chest is hidden in the mouth of a mounted goblin head nearby.)</p>
<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. A bed with a canopy of spiderwebs fills the eastern alcove. Other furnishings include a dresser and a vanity that has an empty frame where the mirror should be.</p>

The lock is old and can be picked by using thieves' tools and making a successful DC 12 Dexterity check.</p>
<p>The building is full of cobwebs, and a 3-foot-tall oval mirror hangs on the western wall. Eerily realistic spiders are carved into its stone frame, almost appearing to twitch and crawl. When a creature approaches within 5 feet of its reflection in the mirror, the reflection disappears and is replaced with the shadowy face of a giant spider obscured by smoke.</p>
<p>The creature in the mirror is a projection of a yochlol demon in the service of T&rsquo;rissa&rsquo;s mother, Vlonwelv. If the figure standing before the mirror is T&rsquo;rissa or someone who looks exactly like her, the spider offers a warm greeting in Elvish with its clicking mandibles and demands to know why efforts have been started to conquer the Twisted Caverns (level 4) when Stromkuhldur and Skullport have yet to be taken.</p>
<p>If a creature that is clearly not T&rsquo;rissa stands before it, or if the yochlol realizes it has been fooled, the demon assumes its true waxy form, stares back with its one glaring red eye, and screams in Abyssal, &ldquo;I know who you are!&rdquo; The mirror then falls and shatters on the floor.</p>

<p><strong>Stone Basin</strong>. A large, empty basin is carved into the floor at the northern end of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vein of turquoise runs from the top right corner of the east wall to the bottom left, heading down toward the empty basin. The trout carvings appear to be swimming upstream, away from the basin. Close examination of these carvings reveals that the fish can be rotated. The first time all the fish are turned so that they appear to be swimming downstream, a hidden valve in the basin opens and fills the container with 50 gallons of fresh water. Swimming in the water is a tiny emerald fish.</p>

Drow Barracks</h4><p>Twelve bedrolls are spread out on the floor of this room. Six off-duty male drow and a male drow elite warrior relax here, but they quickly snatch up their weapons at the first sign of trouble. The drow are named Alybbrin, Chasmas, Jarkorl, K&rsquo;yordred, Szorth, and Xebrek. The drow elite warrior, Ranaghax Auvryndar, is regaling the other drow with a reenactment of a one-on-one battle he had with a hobgoblin captain of the Legion of Azrok, which ended with the captain catching Ranaghax&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> blade in the neck. His telling of the tale is loud enough to be heard by characters listening at the door.</p>
<p>Ranaghax, T&rsquo;rissa&rsquo;s older brother, is subordinate to her and all other female drow in his house. He knows his place and eagerly awaits the opportunity to claim the rest of Stromkuhldur when T&rsquo;rissa finally gives the order to do so.</p>

Azrok&rsquo;s Hold</h3><p>The largest unburied section of Stromkuhldur is held by the Legion of Azrok and is called Azrok&rsquo;s Hold. As rumors of Azrok&rsquo;s blindness spread quietly through the settlement, fears mount of an impending attack from the drow in Stromkuhldur or from Skullport. A shroud of gloom and anxiety hangs over the normally raucous settlement, which has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ruins</strong>. The 30-foot-high cavern is a maze of single-story stone buildings, many of which have partially collapsed. Most of the buildings have 10-foot-high walls and no roofs.</p>
<p><strong>Streets</strong>. The narrow &ldquo;streets&rdquo; between the buildings are strewn with trash and filth. Harmless rats scurry around every corner.</p>
<p><strong>Banners</strong>. Hanging from several structures are tattered yellow banners bearing Azrok&rsquo;s sigil, a bloody handprint inside a hollow red triangle.</p>
<p><strong>Patrols</strong>. Four bands of hobgoblins patrol Azrok&rsquo;s Hold. Each patrol consists of three Hobgoblin and a hobgoblin captain, who interrogates visitors and demands to see their identification papers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visitors entering Azrok&rsquo;s Hold are greeted by two Bugbear. Drow are attacked on sight. Others may enter and move through Azrok&rsquo;s Hold, provided they have the proper identification papers. Visitors without papers are escorted by the bugbears to <strong>area area 21c</strong> for processing.</p>
<p>Once each party member has papers, the bugbears take the characters to see Azrok in <strong>area area 21n</strong>. This meeting is not optional, since tribute must be paid to the hobgoblin warlord in return for his hospitality. Afterward, characters can move freely about Azrok&rsquo;s Hold, coming and going as they please. (Visitors need to register again only if they lose their papers.) If the characters wander the streets on their own, use the Random Encounters in Azrok&rsquo;s Hold table as needed.</p>

<p>Combat behind closed doors probably doesn&rsquo;t raise an alarm, but any loud disturbance in the streets is likely to put the entire settlement on alert. As it happens, the Legion of Azrok&rsquo;s military has been winnowed down by recent altercations with the drow. The current defenders of Azrok&rsquo;s Hold include eight bugbears, thirty-two goblins, twenty hobgoblins, four hobgoblin captains (including Lurkana), Azrok the hobgoblin warlord, and two worgs. These forces don&rsquo;t include goblinoids in league with the Xanathar Guild or other visitors, nor do they include noncombatants such as children.</p>
<p>Buildings not keyed on the map are assumed to be empty rooms. The rest are described below.</p>

Gouged into the door frame is the word &ldquo;Krek&rdquo; (a Goblin word meaning &ldquo;this for that&rdquo; or &ldquo;trade&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The walls of the shop on the other side of the door have caved in, and the space that remains is filled with piles of junk and well-worn adventuring gear. The shop&rsquo;s proprietor is an oni disguised as an old hobgoblin named Kinrob. If a character is looking to procure an item on the Adventuring Gear table or the Tools table in chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook, there&rsquo;s a 25 percent chance that Kinrob has the item in question and will trade it for one or more items of equal or greater value.</p>
<p>Kinrob&rsquo;s true nature is a well-known &ldquo;secret&rdquo; in the Legion of Azrok, and fear of the oni has rendered the surrounding neighborhood a ghost town. Azrok placates the oni by giving it newborn goblins to feed on. The first time the characters visit Kinrob, a bugbear enters to deliver a goblin child in a basket, then skulks away. Kinrob puts the meal aside until its business with the characters is concluded, then politely shows them the door.</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong>. A hobgoblin wearing cracked half-moon spectacles sits behind a stone lectern and greets all those who enter, directing each new arrival to one of the available goblin clerks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visitors are required to carry identification papers at all times in Azrok&rsquo;s Hold. The goblins behind the desks interview visitors, draw crude pictures of them, and fill out papers with their names, races, ages, heights, eye color, skills, and home cities. The same information is also entered in a large ledger. Inquiries about other visitors are met with silent stares, because the goblins have instructions not to reveal any of the information.</p>
<p>Once all the characters are registered and have identification papers, the hobgoblin behind the lectern rings a bell, and two Bugbear appear to escort the visitors to <strong>area area 21n</strong>, where they are expected to pay deference to Warlord Azrok.</p>

Xanathar&rsquo;s Ambassador</h4><p>A mind flayer named Ulquess resides here, serving as the ambassador from Skullport. Ulquess has been implanting intellect devourers in the skulls of goblinoids, turning them into spies loyal to Xanathar. If its plot is discovered, the mind flayer has no choice but to telepathically summon its thralls from <strong>area area 21f</strong> to kill anyone who knows its secret. (It hides the bodies in <strong>area area 22</strong>.)</p>
<p>The room&rsquo;s centerpiece consists of two elegant chairs made of petrified wood arranged atop a circular rug. On a slender table between the chairs is a makeshift, three-tiered Dragonchess set assembled from myriad pieces of other sets. The mind flayer conducts business here while seated casually in one of the chairs.</p>
<p>If the characters are meeting with the ambassador at Lurkana&rsquo;s urging (see &ldquo;<strong>area Side Quest: Retrieve Azrok&rsquo;s Dagger</strong>"), the mind flayer politely discourages them from visiting Skullport, claiming that it&rsquo;s not safe for adventurers. It also tells them an Undermountain secret, hoping they&rsquo;ll be lured away by the mystery. Draw a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C).</p>

Preeta Kreepa</h4><p>Dug out of a mostly collapsed section of Stromkuhldur is a stone hovel in a cave lit by <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast in several old cauldrons lying among the rubble.</p>
<p>The door to the hovel is ajar, and harmless rats scurry in and out in a constant stream. Inside the hovel, feeding bits of juicy moss to the rats, is a mage named Preeta Kreepa. She served as an assistant to Arcturia, one of Halaster&rsquo;s apprentices, until Arcturia transformed her into a monstrous horror. Preeta looks like an old woman with two beholder eyestalks sprouting from her eye sockets. Her mouth, twice as large as it should be, is filled with sharp, pointed teeth. She wears the flayed, slippery, translucent skin of a kuo-toa as a cloak.</p>
<p>For years, the Legion of Azrok left Preeta alone. Now the growing hostilities with the drow have prompted Azrok to call on her for help. Preeta understands the threat posed by the drow and is using <wc-fetch type=spell>animate dead</wc-fetch> spells to raise drow corpses, creating forces that Azrok can call upon to bolster his defenses. She keeps these undead warriors locked in <strong>area area 21q</strong>.</p>
<p>Preeta is a mage, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Preeta is chaotic neutral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 120 feet, and she speaks Common, Dwarvish, Goblin, and Undercommon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a bonus action or a reaction, she can shoot one of the following eye rays at one target she can see within 120 feet of her:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fear Ray.</b> The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch> for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Paralyzing Ray.</b> The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>paralyzed</wc-fetch> for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters promise not to harm her, Preeta shares two Undermountain secrets with them. Determine each secret by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C).</p>

Azrok&rsquo;s Hall</h4><p>Two Hobgoblin stand guard outside this building, one in front of each door. They allow registered visitors to enter after checking their identification papers.</p>
<p>This structure once housed a dwarven smithy, and the decor suggests as much. Its contents are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Azrok and Lurkana</strong>. In the northeast part of the room, Azrok the hobgoblin warlord sits on a throne of bleached skulls, with one foot resting on an iron anvil and one hand on the pommel of his greatsword. He wears a helm that covers most of his face and darkens his eyes. Whispering in his ear is his wife Lurkana, a formidable hobgoblin captain.</p>
<p><strong>Goblinoids</strong>. Attending the warlord are two Bugbear, four Hobgoblin, and six Goblin. One of the bugbears has an intellect devourer hidden in its skull and acts as a spy for Xanathar while feigning loyalty to Azrok.</p>
<p><strong>Worgs</strong>. Gnawing on humanoid bones in the southwest part of the room are two Worg loyal to Azrok and Lurkana.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adventurers brought before Azrok are expected to offer tribute. He is more interested in oaths of fealty than in tangible gifts, but he accepts whatever he&rsquo;s offered. Unless the characters make fools of themselves, Azrok grants them his protection for the duration of their stay in his settlement. Any character who interacts with him and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check realizes that the hobgoblin warlord is blind but is hiding that fact, never looking directly at anyone. The characters also see a ghastly pendant on a cord around his neck—a severed human finger that wears a platinum signet ring (see &ldquo;Lord Rosznar&rsquo;s Ring&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>When the characters are done speaking with Azrok, Lurkana takes them aside and offers them a quest (see &ldquo;<strong>area Side Quest: Retrieve Azrok&rsquo;s Dagger</strong>"). If they refuse, Lurkana scowls and kicks them out.</p>
<p>If combat breaks out, the hobgoblins stationed outside immediately raise a general alarm, causing all forces loyal to Azrok to converge on the area.</p>

Inscribed on the inside of the band are the words &ldquo;To Kres—Fly high and stoop swift.&rdquo; The ring is worth 25 gp.</p>
<p>The finger upon which the ring rests once belonged to Kressando Rosznar, who came to Azrok&rsquo;s Hold after failing to make progress in dealings with the Xanathar Guild in Skullport. The young nobleman was looking to set up a slavery ring in Undermountain, with slaves flowing down from Waterdeep and money flowing up into House Rosznar&rsquo;s coffers as well as Azrok&rsquo;s war chest.</p>
<p>Azrok was intrigued by the proposition but found Kressando condescending. He killed the nobleman for failing to show the proper respect. Kressando&rsquo;s gutted corpse was fed to the otyugh in <strong>area area 17e</strong>, but Azrok kept the finger as a trophy. If the characters want to retrieve the ring to complete a quest (see &ldquo;Search for <strong>area Kressando Rosznar</strong>"), they&rsquo;ll have to kill Azrok, charm him into relinquishing it, or steal it while he&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>.

Arch Gate to Level 6</h4><p>Embedded in the west wall of this otherwise empty chamber is an arch gate to level 6 (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"). The keystone of this arch is carved to look like a gold dragon wyrmling, its mouth agape. The rules of this gate are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The gate opens for 1 minute when a gemstone worth at least 100 gp is placed in the dragon&rsquo;s mouth, which causes the dragon head to animate and chomp down on the gem (destroying it).</li>
<li>Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 36c on level 6</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>

Azrok and Lurkana&rsquo;s Quarters</h4><p>Standing in front of the door to this chamber is a tired goblin named Salt Nose, so named because he has white freckles on his broad snout. He&rsquo;s suffering from three levels of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> and is trying to keep a 10-foot pole steady with trembling hands. From the top of the pole hangs Azrok&rsquo;s banner: a bloody handprint inside a hollow red triangle on a sheet of yellow-dyed flesh.</p>
<p>Lurkana uses the banner as a form of punishment; she makes disobedient or incompetent underlings stand outside these quarters for hours or even days on end with no food, no water, and only the banner to keep them company. Salt Nose spilled a plate of food on Azrok&rsquo;s lap and fears that he will spend what little remains of his life here. Characters who take pity on him earn his trust, and he readily tells them where to find things in Azrok&rsquo;s Hold. If information is what the characters seek, Salt Nose suggests they speak with Preeta Kreepa, a strange creature that has lived in Stromkuhldur since before the goblinoids came (see <strong>area area 21m</strong>).</p>
<p>The building is empty except for a large bed covered with furs. Azrok and Lurkana come here to rest.</p>

Azrok&rsquo;s War Chest</h4><p>Two Hobgoblin stand guard outside this chamber, one in front of each door.</p>
<p>What was once a shrine to the dwarven pantheon is now Azrok&rsquo;s treasury. The room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toppled Idols</strong>. Dozens of stone idols of dwarven gods have been toppled from their bases and smashed on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Altar</strong>. A low altar near the west wall is covered in dried blood. Piled around it are drow shortswords, hand crossbows, shields, and skulls.</p>
<p><strong>Statuette</strong>. Atop the altar rests a 7-inch-tall statuette of Maglubiyet, the goblin god of war, carved from blood-red stone. It is not valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Chests</strong>. Flanking the altar are two iron treasure chests without locks (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stealing Azrok&rsquo;s treasure deprives the warlord of the funds he needs to ensure his troops' loyalty. News of the robbery causes most of the bugbears and goblins, as well as half of the hobgoblins, to flee Azrok&rsquo;s Hold and seek employment as mercenaries in Skullport.</p>

<p>Any good fortune visited upon the Legion of Azrok is temporary, as more of Azrok&rsquo;s goblinoids come under Xanathar&rsquo;s sway.
