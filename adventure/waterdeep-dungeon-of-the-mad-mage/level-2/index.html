<p>This level of Undermountain is designed for four 6th-level characters. Those who overcome this level&rsquo;s challenges should amass enough XP to reach 7th level.</p>

These goblins oppose the Xanathar Guild and its beholder overlord. The rest of the dungeon is infested with sentient magical experiments and leftovers from the days when Halaster&rsquo;s apprentices used this level as a laboratory. The characters might also encounter a troublesome drow, a wererat gang, and members of a doomed adventuring party.</p>
<h3 id=goblins>
<a href=#goblins class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Goblins</h3><p>The Rustbone tribe of goblins has claimed an old throne room (<strong>area area 1</strong>) and turned it into a bazaar. The Xanathar Guild wants to shut down the market before it attracts too many surface dwellers, while the goblins fight to keep it open. Admission into the goblin bazaar is free, but non-goblinoids are closely watched.</p>
<p>The goblin boss, Yek, recently found a magic circlet that transformed him into a human (see <strong>area area 1f</strong>). After his initial surprise passed, Yek warmed to the transformation. After all, it made him taller. The other goblins quietly resent taking orders from a human and would like to see Yek returned to normal. They might conspire with adventurers toward that end, offering them the circlet as a reward for undoing Yek&rsquo;s &ldquo;curse.&rdquo;</p>

There are two Xanathar Guild watch posts on the level, and each one has a leader: a drow named Shunn &ldquo;Spider Eyes&rdquo; Shurreth commands the northern watch post at <strong>area area 9</strong>, and a human berserker named Nadia the Unbent leads the southern watch post at <strong>area area 20</strong>.</p>
<p>Wererats recently stole a stone key from the southern outpost. Shunn believes that the key unlocks something important (though he doesn&rsquo;t know what that might be) and wants to reclaim it. He intends to capture a wererat and ransom it for the safe return of the key. He offers 50 gp to anyone who brings him a wererat captive or the location of the wererats' hideout (<strong>area area 14</strong>).</p>

The drow, Rizzeryl, has eight wererats in his employ. The Xanathar Guild is aware of the wererats, but not their drow master.</p>
<p>Rizzeryl has the stone key that the wererats stole from the Xanathar Guild. He thinks it might unlock a Melairkyn vault hidden somewhere on this level, but he&rsquo;s wrong. In fact, the key opens a magic gate that connects levels 6 and 8 of Undermountain. The drow will give up this key in exchange for his life or the destruction of the Xanathar Guild outposts on this level.</p>

If Halleth the revenant (see <strong>area level 1, area 37</strong>) accompanies the characters, he uses his Vengeful Tracker trait to lead the party to his former companions so he can repay them for their betrayal. These three &ldquo;Fine Fellows&rdquo; are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copper Stormforge, a dwarven thief, values gold above all. He has been captured by goblins and imprisoned in <strong>area area 1e</strong>.</li>
<li>Midna Tauberth, a human priest of Shar, thinks she can do everything herself. The perils of this level have forced her to take refuge in <strong>area area 11b</strong>.</li>
<li>Rex the Hammer, a human warrior, seeks fortune and glory, and doesn&rsquo;t care whom he steps on to achieve it. The characters find him at the mercy of the mezzoloth in <strong>area area 13g</strong>.</li>

Such monsters include carrion crawlers, gricks, mephits, owlbears, and spectators.

Auction Hall</h4><p>The goblins are erecting a stage against the north wall of this 20-foot-high chamber using wood stolen from elsewhere in Undermountain. Once the stage is complete, the goblins plan to auction slaves and other valuable merchandise here. The stage will be quite large when it&rsquo;s finished but is still in the preliminary stages of assembly. A pile of wrecked wooden furniture lies in the area&rsquo;s northwest corner.</p>
<p>Seven Goblin are here. Three of them are using stone hammers to pound rusty nails through decrepit wooden planks. The other four are clustered in the middle of the room, passing around a scroll on which someone has drawn a crude blueprint of a stage. If attacked, these goblins retreat to <strong>area area 1d</strong>. They otherwise pay no attention to strangers.</p>

Gibbets and Gravy</h4><p>Four iron gibbets hang from chains hooked to the 10-foot-high ceiling. The gibbets are empty except for one that holds a wailing goblin named Glom.</p>
<p>Glom was caught stealing food intended for the goblin boss, Yek. She hasn&rsquo;t eaten in two days and happily provides information or her service as a guide in exchange for food or freedom. She knows about the magic circlet that turned Yek into a human and where the goblin boss keeps the rest of his treasure (<strong>area area 1f</strong>).</p>
<p>Glom knows the general layout of this level of Undermountain, the positions of the Xanathar Guild outposts, and the location of the stairs leading down to level 3. Glom eagerly betrays her liberators if someone with more food and the promise of a better life comes along.</p>
<p>The lock on Glom&rsquo;s gibbet can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. It can also be broken off with a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check or a solid weapon blow.</p>

<p><strong>Goblin Vendors</strong>. The middle of the chamber is taken up by eight vendor stalls. Twenty-two Goblin are here, sixteen vendors (two per stall) and six guards who stand in pairs near the exits to <strong>area areas 1e</strong>, <strong>area 1f</strong>, and <strong>area 8</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Throne</strong>. A granite throne stands against the north wall atop a rectangular stone dais.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goblin vendors buy and sell stolen goods, including items listed in chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbookâ€”particularly armor, shields, weapons, adventuring gear, tools, trade goods, food, and drink. The goblins buy goods at half the normal price and sell them at three times the normal price. Their food is of poor quality but edible. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check can bargain a goblin down to half its asking price for an item.</p>
<p>The goblin guards have orders to keep the peace. If a brawl or a battle erupts, they attack with the goal of knocking troublesome visitors <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>. Visitors whom the guards subdue are dragged out of the market and left in <strong>area area 8</strong> without their weapons or treasure.

Yek the Tall</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Torches</strong>. Flickering torches in iron brackets light this room.</p>
<p><strong>Bugbears</strong>. Four Bugbear stand in the room&rsquo;s corners.</p>
<p><strong>Goblins</strong>. A handsome man wearing a golden circlet on his brow (Yek the Tall, a goblin boss in altered form) reclines on a mound of cushions at the north end of the room, eating an apple. Ten Goblin (Yek&rsquo;s toadies) lie about on moldy cushions around him.</p>
<p><strong>Prisoner</strong>. Chained to the south wall is a male dwarf clad in leather armor who has been gagged. He has copper-orange hair, but his beard has been shaved off (see &ldquo;Shaved Dwarf&rdquo; below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bugbears work for Yek because he pays them. A bugbear abandons Yek and returns home to Skullport (on level 3) if given a bribe of 5 gp or more.</p>
<p>If Yek orders the goblins into battle, they fight reluctantly. If half are killed or <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>, the rest flee. The goblins also run away if Yek is slain.</p>
<p>Yek wears a gold circlet (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below) that has transformed him into a beautiful adult male human. In this form, his size is Medium. If the characters humble themselves before Yek and appeal to his vanity, they are treated fairly. If they attempt to steal from him or have harmed any of his underlings, Yek sentences them to death and orders his goblin toadies and the bugbears to attack. Yek joins the fray only in self-defense.</p>
<p>If the characters and Yek part company on peaceful terms, three of Yek&rsquo;s goblin toadies try to speak to the characters afterward, away from the goblin boss. They plead with the characters to end Yek&rsquo;s &ldquo;curse&rdquo; by stealing the circlet that has transformed the goblin boss into a human. They don&rsquo;t have a plan for doing so and are hoping the characters can devise one. The toadies can get all the other goblins out of the hall, but they have no control over Yek&rsquo;s bugbear bodyguards.</p>

His hatred for goblins increased tenfold when they chopped off his beard, and if he is set free, he tries to kill every one of them.</p>
<p>As a reward for setting him free, Copper gives his liberators what he claims is an authentic map of the Sargauth Level (level 3). Copper folded the map into a tiny package and tucked it between his butt cheeks to hide it from his captors. He doesn&rsquo;t realize the map is fake and utterly worthless.</p>
<p>Copper is a shield dwarf scout, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copper is neutral evil.</li>
<li>He has these racial traits: He speaks Common and Dwarvish. His walking speed is 25 feet. He has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance to poison damage.</li>

<p>Yek&rsquo;s circlet is an uncommon magic item called a <wc-fetch type=item>circlet of human perfection</wc-fetch>. Only humanoids can attune to it. The circlet transforms its attuned wearer into an attractive human of average height and weight. The circlet chooses the physical characteristics of the form, such as age, gender, skin color, hair color, and voice. Except for size, the wearer&rsquo;s statistics and racial traits don&rsquo;t change, nor do items worn or carried by the wearer. Removing the circlet ends the effect.</p>

<ul>
<li>A gruesome diorama featuring the stuffed corpses of a beholder and six goblins, all of them in battle poses and adorned with costume jewelry</li>
<li>An ivory chessboard on a low stone table</li>
<li>A 9-foot-tall, 3-foot-wide framed painting of Yek, depicting him in his regal human form, standing proudly with his golden circlet on his brow</li>
<li>A hefty, iron-banded wooden chest with iron rings for handles</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters who loot the diorama find fifteen pieces of costume jewelry worth 1 gp each. The ivory chessboard is worth 25 gp. The wooden chest is filled with 2,000 sp.</p>
<p>The painting of Yek has no real value, though a clever character can sell it for 50 gp by convincing a naive buyer that the painting depicts a figure of historical importance; doing so requires a successful DC 13 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

Kalabash&rsquo;s Bedroom</h4><p>The door to this room bears a sign written in Common that reads, &ldquo;Kalabash&rsquo;s Room. Do not enter unless your name is Halaster.&rdquo; The room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. A dusty bed stands with its headboard against the north wall. At the foot of the bed rests a locked wooden chest (see &ldquo;Trapped Chest&rdquo; below). A desk in the southeast corner has stacks of musty old tomes atop it (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p><strong>Summoning Circle</strong>. An old rug woven with arcane symbols lies in the middle of the floor. (Beneath the rug, painted on the stone floor, is a 10-foot-diameter summoning circle that has been partially erased.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The summoning circle hidden under the rug radiates an aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell, but three of its activation glyphs have been erased. A character who examines the circle and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check can reconstruct the circle and, with blood or paint, reapply the missing glyphs in <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> minutes.</p>
<p>If the circle is completed, it immediately summons Kalabash (CE male Calishite human mage). Appearing in the middle of the circle, Kalabash attacks any creatures he sees. He is intoxicated and suffers the effects of the <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> condition until he sobers up or until the condition is ended with a <wc-fetch type=spell>lesser restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. Erasing part of the completed circle causes Kalabash to be whisked back to his pocket dimension.</p>
<p>The only item of value Kalabash has is his spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared. He also carries around an empty wine flask.</p>

Picking the lock requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If that check does not succeed, or if anyone tries to break or smash the lock, the mechanism releases a small bolt of lightning that deals 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) lightning damage to the creature tampering with it (no saving throw). The chest is empty except for a note in Common that reads, &ldquo;Retirement fund. Don&rsquo;t spend this on ale, Kalabash!&rdquo;</p>

Halaster Puppet</h3><p>Both doors to this room are difficult to open because furniture inside has been piled against them. A successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check forces open either door. Apart from these crude barricades, the room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Automaton</strong>. An animated, life-size puppet of Halaster Blackcloak is hard at work on an experiment. The puppet is made primarily of wood and canvas, with a shoddy gray cloak draped over its shoulders. Dozens of cloth eyes have been sewn into the cloak.</p>
<p><strong>Table</strong>. The puppet looms over a stone table covered with dusty alchemical equipment and vials of various solid and liquid substances, but nothing valuable or dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The puppet responds to any movement within 20 feet of it and threatens any creature that comes closer, shouting in Halaster&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;Terrible and painful magical death! Fireballs and lightning bolts! Begone!&rdquo; It speaks and understands Common, but voices nothing but empty threats and a desire to continue its &ldquo;work&rdquo; undisturbed. If asked what it&rsquo;s working on, it shouts, &ldquo;Magic!&rdquo; and chuckles. A character who watches the puppet work and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check ascertains that the puppet isn&rsquo;t doing anything other than mixing harmless substances while muttering gobbledygook.</p>
<p>The puppet is a Medium construct with AC 10, 8 hit points, a walking speed of 20 feet, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and ability scores of 10. It can&rsquo;t be <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch>, and it is not subject to <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>. It speaks and understands Common, has no attacks, and falls to pieces if reduced to 0 hit points or if a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 15) is cast on it. Hidden inside the puppet is a flask of alchemist&rsquo;s fire that shatters as the puppet falls to pieces, causing its remnants to catch fire. The breaking flask does no harm to nearby creatures.</p>
<p>If the puppet is destroyed, Halaster&rsquo;s voice magically calls out, &ldquo;Auugh! Now who will find the cure to filth fever?!&rdquo; before trailing off into silence.</p>

Abandoned Camp</h3><p>The Xanathar Guild had a base camp here, but it was forced to abandon the place after a run-in with the Fine Fellows of Daggerford.</p>
<p>This room is strewn with rotten supplies and the remains of a fire pit. Three bugbear corpses and an intellect devourer&rsquo;s body are heaped in the northeast corner.

Arch Gate to Level 4</h3><p>This dusty room is hidden behind a secret door disguised to look like a plain section of wall.</p>
<p>Embedded in the middle of the room&rsquo;s north wall is a stone arch, its frame engraved with images of falling coins. The arch&rsquo;s keystone has a tiny slot in it. This is one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>"), and its rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeding a gold coin into the slot in the keystone causes the coin to disappear and the gate to open for 1 minute. Other coins placed in the slot disappear but don&rsquo;t open the gate.</li>
<li>Characters must be 8th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 11c on level 4</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>

Music of the Dead</h3><p>The hallway leading to this chamber is filled with the haunting sound of a harpsichord playing. The room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Harpsichord</strong>. in the middle of the room is a harpsichord made entirely of bones, with human, dwarf, ogre, and halfling finger bones for keys. somber music emanates from it.</p>
<p><strong>Carving</strong>. Carved into the north wall is a single measure of musical notes. They are faded and difficult to read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bone harpsichord has been enchanted to play on its own but stops when a living creature comes within 10 feet of it. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the harpsichord and a smaller aura of necromancy magic emanating from something inside it.</p>
<p>Any character who has proficiency with a musical instrument can correctly play the displayed notes on the bone harpsichord. Any other character who tries to do so must make a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Performance</wc-fetch>) check. A successful check causes a decorative skull above the keys to fall away, revealing the treasure (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). On a failed check, the performer must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the performer takes 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) necrotic damage, and the flesh of its hands is eaten away, leaving bleached white (but functional) skeletal hands.</p>

<p>The copper-plated door is connected to the lightning grid in <strong>area area 7c</strong>. Unless the creatures in <strong>area area 7c</strong> have been destroyed, the door emits a soft hum when approached. A creature that touches the humming door must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature wearing metal armor has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>

<ul>
<li>The skull has resistance to fire damage and immunity to lightning damage.</li>
<li>It has the <wc-fetch type=spell>lightning bolt</wc-fetch> spell prepared instead of <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch>.</li>
<li>Replace its Fire Ray attack option with a Lightning Ray attack option that deals lightning damage instead of fire damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>On each of its turns, the skull uses its action to electrify the copper-plated floor with its lightning rays. The floor remains electrified until the start of the skull&rsquo;s next turn. While the floor is electrified, any creature that steps onto the copper tiles or starts its turn in contact with them takes 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) lightning damage. Instead of taking damage, the flesh golem regains 10 hit points whenever it starts its turn on the electrified floor.</p>
<p>If the skull is destroyed and later rejuvenates (see the flameskull&rsquo;s Rejuvenation trait), it resumes electrifying the floor and defending the room, with or without the golem.</p>

The curse partially transformed him into a spider, giving him eight red arachnid eyes, a mouth full of fangs, and black bristles sprouting from his slender limbs. A <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell restores Shunn&rsquo;s natural form, but Shunn doesn&rsquo;t want the curse lifted. His horrific appearance strikes fear into the hearts of his comrades-in-arms and has earned him favor with Xanathar. Shunn believes that returning to his normal form might weaken his influence over his gang and diminish his status in the Xanathar Guild.</p>
<p>Shunn is a drow elite warrior, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shunn is lawful evil.</li>
<li>While cursed with spider features, he can climb difficult surfaces, even across ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shunn moves and converses with an eerie grace and prefers diplomacy over violence when dealing with adventurers. If the characters seem interested in a truce, Shunn offers them 50 gp if they find the wererats that are troubling his gang and return the stone key that they stole. Shunn&rsquo;s gang found the stone key on this level of Undermountain and is still searching for the lock that it fits into.</p>
<p>If he or his thugs are attacked, Shunn Shurreth calls for bugbear reinforcements from <strong>area area 9d</strong>. Shunn&rsquo;s goal in any conflict is to capture his enemies and haul them to Skullport as trophies. Once there, the prisoners are brought to Skull Island and left to the tender mercies of Commander Sundeth (see &ldquo;Skullport&rdquo;).</p>

<p><strong>Frescoes</strong>. The walls are carved with frescoes depicting horrific cyclopean cities of black stone submerged beneath raging seas.</p>
<p><strong>Giant Ooze</strong>. A gelatinous cube measuring 30 feet on a side is trapped in the room. The monster is situated in the northeast corner when the characters first arrive. Floating in the center of it is a dwarven skull sheathed in glass. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check can tell that the skull is suspended in an enormous gelatinous cube, not levitating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the skull, which belonged to a duergar. Halaster preserved within the skull the duergar&rsquo;s magical ability to enlarge itself. The skull now has the power to enlarge the gelatinous cube, and the skull&rsquo;s glassy coating protects it from the cube&rsquo;s digestive acid. Removing the skull from the gelatinous cube causes the cube to shrink to its normal size (10 feet on a side). The skull has no magical properties other than its ability to enlarge gelatinous cubes (and potentially other oozes, at your discretion).</p>
<p>While enlarged by the duergar skull, the gelatinous cube has the following modified statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cube is Gargantuan and can hold up to nine Large creatures or up to thirty-six Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.</li>
<li>It can make up to four Pseudopod attacks on its turn, and it makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage.</li>

Master of the Unseen</h4><p>Flickering torchlight created by <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells spills out of this room into the hall. The 15-foot-high vaulted chamber contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Light</strong>. Freestanding iron torch sconces in the four corners of the room have <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast upon them.</p>
<p><strong>Midna</strong>. Midna Tauberth (NE female human priest of Shar) relaxes in one of several overstuffed chairs in the middle of the room, waited on by nine Living Unseen Servant (see appendix A). Around her neck, she wears two holy symbols: one shaped like a gold coin (the symbol of Waukeen, god of trade), the other a black disk outlined in purple (the symbol of Shar, god of darkness and loss).</p>
<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. Empty bookshelves and desks line the walls. Against the south wall stands a long banquet table bearing fresh foodstuffs on copper platters and copper flagons filled to the brim with wine. A portrait of a smiling Halaster hangs above the table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each day at dawn, the platters and flagons on the table are mystically replenished with fresh food and wine, courtesy of Halaster&rsquo;s magic. The effect produces enough food and wine for twelve people. The magic persists as long as the table remains in this room and there is dishware capable of containing the bounty.</p>

She advises characters to leave or face the wrath of her <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> servants. If they don&rsquo;t leave at once, she orders the servants to beat them senseless. If the servants seem to be losing the fight, she calls them off and, in the interest of self-preservation, apologizes for her boorishness and allows the newcomers to partake of the food and wine on the table.</p>
<p>If Halleth the revenant (see <strong>area level 1, area 37</strong>) is present, he tries to kill Midna and reclaim his holy symbol of Waukeen. Midna stole it from Halleth&rsquo;s corpse and shrinks away from his revenant while commanding the living unseen servants to defend her. If Midna is slain and the holy symbol of Waukeen is returned to Halleth, the revenant&rsquo;s thirst for vengeance abates, and both it and the holy symbol turn to dust.</p>

She can&rsquo;t issue orders to a single servant without the others performing the same task.</p>

Any character who takes the time to clean the altar gains the following magical boon: all secret doors are plainly visible to that character for the next 24 hours.

<p>The nothics are insane and attack most creatures they encounter. They are easily and quickly cowed by displays of magic, however. Once they realize they&rsquo;re in the presence of one or more spellcasters, the nothics become slightly more cooperative.

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>. Mine carts about the room contain glittering heaps of copper ore.</p>
<p><strong>Battle</strong>. A wounded warrior named Rex the Hammer (LE male Illuskan human champion with 22 hit points remaining; see appendix A) has been backed into the southeast corner by a vicious mezzoloth and two Nothic. Three dead nothics (killed by Rex) lie on the floor near them.</p>

Despite hearing rumors about the dangers of Undermountain, Rex assumed (based on the success of Durnan and other capable explorers) that the Fine Fellows would run roughshod over the monsters dwelling within. Boy, was he wrong. Like most villainous groups, the Fine Fellows lacked cohesion. Fed up with his companions' bickering, Rex struck off on his own. He was searching this room for loot when the mezzoloth and the nothics came in behind him, cutting off his escape.</p>
<p>If the characters come to his rescue, Rex expresses his gratitude before quaffing the healing potion in his backpack (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). On the surface, he seems to be amiable, confident, and eager to discover Undermountain&rsquo;s secrets. He&rsquo;s happy to join the party for an equal share of any loot found. Once he&rsquo;s back at full health (or close to it), though, Rex sheds his civil veneer and tries to bully the characters into following his orders, berating and threatening anyone who defies him.

Base de RÃ©sistance</h3><p>These two chambers have been claimed by a drow mage named Rizzeryl, his summoned quasit minion, and eight wererats. At least for now, Rizzeryl and the wererats are staunch allies.</p>
<p>Rizzeryl works for two groups: House Auvryndar, a low-ranking drow house from Menzoberranzan that is slowly and secretly consolidating its power in Undermountain, and the Zhentarim, which is trying to drive the Xanathar Guild out of Skullport. His ties to the Black Network make Rizzeryl an enemy of the Xanathar Guild, which currently controls Skullport and is trying to secure the uppermost levels of Undermountain.</p>
<p>Rizzeryl has begun haranguing the Xanathar Guild forces on this level with the help of the wererat gang, which hails from Skullport. The drow wizard and the wererats have no quarrel with adventurers who leave them alone.</p>

Rizzeryl&rsquo;s Hideout</h4><p>The door to this room has a mural painted on the outside depicting a darkmantle descending on an unsuspecting dwarf who is admiring a gleaming gemstone. An <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell has been cast on the door. Rizzeryl the drow mage and his wererat gang can pass through the door, while other creatures must force it open with magic or a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>The room contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Drow</strong>. Rizzeryl the drow mage sits on a chair in the southwest corner while resting in a trance. If he hears someone coming through the eastern door, he casts <wc-fetch type=spell>greater invisibility</wc-fetch> on himself.</p>
<p><strong>Table</strong>. A wooden table in the center of the room bears a map made of loose stones arranged to form walls and doors (see &ldquo;Tabletop Map&rdquo; below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rizzeryl likes to be <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> as he engages intruders in conversation, hoping to learn their intentions. Any noise here alerts the wererats in <strong>area area 14b</strong>, who remain hidden until Rizzeryl calls for them.</p>
<p>Rizzeryl offers the adventurers a reward if they destroy both Xanathar Guild outposts on this level (<strong>area areas 9</strong> and <strong>area 20</strong>) and return with the heads of both guild leaders, whose names, he tells them, are Nadia the Unbent and Shunn Shurreth. Rizzeryl doesn&rsquo;t reveal the nature of the reward, other than to say it will make the party&rsquo;s exploration of Undermountain easier. If the characters deliver the heads of Nadia and Shunn, Rizzeryl gives them a stone key hidden in this room (see &ldquo;Secret Compartment&rdquo; below). If the characters attack him, Rizzeryl calls forth the wererats to defend him while he summons a quasit. If the adventurers overcome these forces, Rizzeryl trades the stone key for his life.</p>
<p>Rizzeryl knows the way to Skullport through level 3 and might share this information with friendly adventurers who have helped him. He refrains from divulging his allegiance to House Auvryndar. He will, however, reveal his allegiance to the Zhentarim if one or more characters identify themselves as members of that faction. If they need assistance, Rizzeryl urges such characters to seek out Bosskyn Gorrb, a tiefling member of the Black Network who operates in Skullport. Rizzeryl also informs them that servants of Xanathar will allow safe passage to anyone who openly brandishes Xanathar&rsquo;s symbol (see below).</p>

It contains three items: Rizzeryl&rsquo;s leather-bound spellbook (which holds the spells he has prepared, plus <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch>), a 12-inch-long stone key, a 12-inch-long driftwood wand with the symbol of Xanathar (a circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its circumference) carved at one end. Rizzeryl uses this nonmagical wand to slip past the guardian in <strong>area area 20a</strong> and to move through Skullport unmolested.</p>
<p>The stone key weighs 10 pounds and bears the following inscription in Dwarvish: &ldquo;Meet me on the Lost Level. Find my twin in Slitherswamp.&rdquo; A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the key, which opens a magic gate that connects levels 6 and 8 of Undermountain (see <strong>area level 6, area 34b</strong>, and <strong>area level 8, area 3</strong>, for more information on each gate). Rizzeryl knows that levels 6 and 8 of Undermountain are called the Lost Level and Slitherswamp, respectively, but he hasn&rsquo;t explored either level.</p>

Wererat Barracks</h4><p>Eight Wererat in human form sleep on dirty cots in this room. They are loyal to the Zhentarim and determined to push the Xanathar Guild out of Skullport and Undermountain.</p>
<p>The wererats are short, unkempt humans of mixed age with thin limbs, beady eyes, and nervous tics. They clad themselves in filthy, smelly, ill-fitting clothes. Their leader is a crass, middle-aged woman named Zilitsa Ilvarren. She is mean-spirited but has a good rapport with Rizzeryl, whose intelligence she admires. The others are a degenerate bunch of inbred, light-fearing weirdos who&rsquo;ve spent too many years living underground. The men are named Frek, Henk, and Kozrik, and the women are Arreth, Elabbor, Kreena, and Sybilee.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rust Monsters</strong>. Two Rust Monster are fighting over a rusted steel helmet in the middle of this room, casting it about as they knock each other around.</p>
<p><strong>Wall Decor</strong>. The walls are decorated with bas-reliefs of dwarves singing and drinking. A dozen empty iron torch brackets are mounted to the north and south walls at 10-foot intervals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rust monsters can&rsquo;t find enough ferrous metal to satisfy their hunger. The helm provides a momentary distraction that characters can use to cross the hall safely after they first arrive. The next time they come here, though, the rust monsters are waiting for them.</p>
<p>The torch brackets bolted to the walls are beyond the rust monsters' reach but make irresistible snacks if fed to the creatures. Tearing loose a torch bracket requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cold</strong>. The room is bitterly cold.</p>
<p><strong>Glowing Rune</strong>. The walls rise 10 feet, then angle inward, forming a pyramidal roof with a 40-foot-high apex. Inscribed on the sloped north wall is a 10-foot-tall Dwarvish rune that glows with a faint blue light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who understands Dwarvish knows that the oversized rune on the north wall is an ancient symbol meaning &ldquo;cold.&rdquo; A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the rune. The rune&rsquo;s magic lowers the room&rsquo;s temperature to 0 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>When a spell is cast in this room (including one cast from a magic item), the giant rune flashes and deals 36 (<wc-roll>8d8</wc-roll>) cold damage to all creatures in the room. Once the rune has released this cold energy, it can&rsquo;t do so again for 1 hour.</p>

<p><strong>Racks</strong>. Weapon and armor racks stand like library bookshelves in the middle of the room, with dusty, web-filled aisles between them.</p>
<p><strong>Sharpening Wheel</strong>. Half embedded in the floor in the middle of the room is a 1-foot-thick, 6-foot-diameter stone sharpening wheel. A stone pedal next to the wheel causes it to turn when stepped on.</p>

<p>One of the bugbears is rummaging through a collection of dwarven morningstars and casting undesirable ones onto the floor. The other two are fighting over a rusty shield embossed with a symbol resembling a stylized goblin skull.</p>
<p>The room contains dozens of suits of plate armor, scale armor, and chain mail, as well as scores of shields, battleaxes, morningstars, warhammers, war picks, and javelins.

<p>Each animated ballista is a Large wood-and-iron construct with AC 15, 50 hit points, a walking speed of 30 feet, immunity to poison damage, and the following ability scores: Strength 14, Dexterity 10, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. It has <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 120 feet and is blind beyond this distance.

As an action, it can fire a magic bolt of fire (+6 to hit) at a target it can perceive, dealing 16 (<wc-roll>3d10</wc-roll>) fire damage on a hit, but it can&rsquo;t attack any creature directly above it. Treat each ballista as a monster with a challenge rating of 2 (450 XP).</p>
<p>The ballistae can&rsquo;t perceive (and thus they ignore) creatures that keep to the easternmost 60-foot section of the hallway. Once they detect intruders, however, the ballistae amble forward on hinged legs to close the distance. If a ballista has nothing to attack on its turn, it returns to its starting position.</p>

The pits' covers blend in with the surrounding floor, though a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check detects each pit.</p>
<p>When a creature weighing 50 pounds or more steps on a pit&rsquo;s cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the creature to spill into the pit below and take <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> bludgeoning damage from the fall. The lid is spring-loaded and snaps closed after the creature falls through. A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the lid open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Wedging at least two iron spikes between the pit&rsquo;s lid and the surrounding floor prevents the lid from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The lid can also be magically held shut with an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. The dwarves constructed the pit covers so that they won&rsquo;t open if an object is rolled over them. A character can circumvent the traps by climbing into an empty barrel and rolling down the hall or climbing onto a barrel and balancing atop it as it rolls down the hall. Balancing atop a barrel as it careens down the hall requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

<p><strong>Light</strong>. The walls climb 15 feet, then angle inward to create a peaked, 30-foot-high ceiling. The sloped upper walls have red glowing crystals set into them. These crystals fill the hall with dim light. (Crystals pried out of their fixtures go dark.)</p>
<p><strong>Carvings</strong>. The lower walls were once lined with carvings depicting dwarves pushing mine carts toward the west, but these works have been defaced and, in some cases, replaced with stony tentacles that protrude from the walls.</p>
<p><strong>Dwarf-Guarded Doors</strong>. A 20-foot-tall double door stands closed at the west end of the hall. Carved into the walls flanking the double door stand armored dwarves, their stony beards flowing out of great helms that conceal their facial features.</p>

<p>Halaster used magic to distort the wall carvings almost beyond recognition and to create tentacle-like protrusions that weren&rsquo;t part of the original design. These tentacles writhe as creatures pass by themâ€”a harmless effect created by the Mad Mage.</p>

<p>Casting a <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> spell on the skeleton reveals that the tiefling, Savir, was a monk who fell prey to a cloaker.

Caryatids of Restoration</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Caryatids</strong>. Supporting the 20-foot-high ceiling are four pillars of white marble, each shaped in the likeness of a stoic female elf in flowing robes with a flowering branch clutched to her chest. The caryatids face inward.</p>
<p><strong>Modron</strong>. Circling the caryatids counterclockwise is a quadrone with its bow at the ready. It makes clicking and clacking noises as it walks.</p>
<p><strong>Bas-Reliefs:</strong> The walls are carved with bas-reliefs of unicorns and bare-branched trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the pillars. Touching a pillar while speaking the proper command phrase (&ldquo;Elf magic!") causes a pale light to fill the area between the four pillars, ending the following conditions on a creature in that area: <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>deafened</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=condition>stunned</wc-fetch>. This magical effect can be activated four times, once for each pillar touched. The pillars regain their magic at the next dawn.</p>
<p>The caryatids lose their magic if even one is destroyed or toppled. A caryatid has AC 17, 90 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It can be toppled with a successful DC 30 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

The pot is painted with images of a bare-footed elf druid leading a march of small, uprooted shrubs that seem to be walking of their own accord.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the pot, which is a common wondrous magic item called a <wc-fetch type=item>pot of awakening</wc-fetch>. If one plants an ordinary shrub in the pot and lets it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an awakened shrub at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it. The awakened shrub is friendly toward whoever planted it. Absent commands from its creator, it does nothing.</p>

Secret Tomb</h4><p>In the middle of the dusty tomb rests a 7,500-pound alabaster sarcophagus atop a 1-foot-high block of granite. The lid of the sarcophagus is carved in the likeness of a regal elf of indeterminate age and gender, with a yawning cat stretching on the elf&rsquo;s chest. The cat is part of the lid&rsquo;s carving, not a separate sculpture.</p>
<p>A character who inspects the sarcophagus closely and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check realizes that it&rsquo;s a solid block of alabaster with a fake lid carved to appear openableâ€”a false tomb built to confound would-be treasure-hunters.</p>

Halaster&rsquo;s Crushing Eye</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Destroyed Tables</strong>. Three stone tables lie strewn about the room, surrounded by ceramic shards that were once funerary urns. (The owlbears in <strong>area area 26a</strong> are responsible for the destruction.)</p>
<p><strong>Sloped Hall</strong>. A 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high hallway to the south slopes gently upward to <strong>area area 26d</strong> and contains a rolling sphere trap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 10-foot-square section of floor marked X on map 2 is a pressure plate. When 20 or more pounds of pressure depress this plate, a 10-foot-diameter stone sphere painted to look like a bloodshot eyeball careens from an alcove at the top of the sloped hallway and down the passage toward <strong>area area 26c</strong>. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check, a character searching the hall for traps can spot the pressure plate. Wedging four or more iron spikes or similar objects under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.</p>
<p>When the sphere is released, all creatures present roll initiative, and the sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves in a straight line until it reaches a corner, then changes direction to follow the sloped tunnel until it comes to rest in <strong>area area 26c</strong>. The sphere can move through other creatures' spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature&rsquo;s space or a creature enters its space while the sphere is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (<wc-roll>10d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage and be knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>A creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down by using an action to make a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere&rsquo;s speed is reduced by 15 feet. In the sloped hallway, this reduction lasts only until the end of the sphere&rsquo;s next turn. If the sphere&rsquo;s speed drops to 0 on a flat surface, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.</p>

<p><strong>Wall Niches</strong>. Beyond the desk and chair, dusty books are crammed into niches in the south wall. Similar niches in the other walls contain tall, alabaster funerary urns covered with dust and cobwebs (seventeen in all).</p>

<p>The books cover the subjects of alchemy, dwarven and elven history, engineering, gemcraft, the study of monstrosities, and weather prediction.

The goblins also train and deploy giant rats, using them as watchdogs. Some of these might be Rizzeryl&rsquo;s wererats in rat form, sent to infiltrate the goblin lair and spy on adventurers who find their way to the goblin bazaar.</p>
<p>Destroying the two Xanathar Guild outposts allows the goblins to expand their territory. Unless the goblins are also wiped out, goblin patrols become more common throughout this level of the dungeon.</p>
