<p>The Obstacle Course is designed for four 13th-level characters, and adventurers who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance to 14th level. Before running this level of Undermountain, review the description of the death tyrant in the &ldquo;Beholders&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual, as that information will help you roleplay the death tyrant that claims the Obstacle Course as its lair.</p>

They might also encounter nuisances from the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire, and a band of githzerai on a special mission.</p>

After carving out a lair for itself, the beholder dreamed itself into undeath, becoming a death tyrant called Netherskull.</p>
<p>When Halaster and Netherskull met in battle, the wizard emerged triumphant, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to destroy such a formidable dungeon guardian. Instead, Halaster agreed to let Netherskull remain the undisputed lord of this level on the condition that it permit Halaster to tinker with and maintain the level&rsquo;s traps, as well as add a magical, mean-spirited announcer that taunts visitors as they blunder from one room to another (see &ldquo;<strong>area Halaster&rsquo;s Play-by-Play</strong>").</p>

They use their psychic abilities and natural stealth to hide from Halaster&rsquo;s magical gaze and the death tyrant&rsquo;s watchful eyes.</p>
<p>The githzerai are aware that githyanki have conquered the Crystal Labyrinth (level 16) and are waging war against a mind flayer colony in Seadeeps (level 17). The githzerai wait patiently to see the outcome of the Seadeeps conflict but stand ready to assist should the githyanki need help. The leader of this githzerai band, Yrlakka, is a member of the Sha&rsquo;sal Khou, a faction of renegade githyanki and githzerai who seek to reunify the gith races. By helping the githyanki defeat a common foe, Yrlakka hopes to demonstrate the merits of a single unified gith race—not only to the evil githyanki, but also to the younger githzerai zerths who follow him. Yrlakka is concerned because his most headstrong pupil, a githzerai named Ezria, has disappeared. He fears (correctly) that Ezria was captured by the githyanki on level 16 while trying to find weak spots in their defenses.</p>

Netherskull terrorizes the lava children and magma mephits from time to time, but not enough to force them to leave the warmth of the chasm. The evil mephits trick or goad the lava children into attacking all other creatures that blunder into their territory.</p>

Two recurring types are described below.</p>
<h4 id=covered-pits>
<a href=#covered-pits class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Covered Pits</h4><p>Melairkyn dwarves built these pits, and Halaster keeps them in working order.</p>
<p>A 10-foot-square slab of 2-inch-thick stone covers each pit. Each cover is carved to resemble the floor surrounding the pit. A character who has a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 17 or higher recognizes the trapped section of floor as the cover of a pit. A character can also search the floor for traps, detecting the pit with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Once a pit is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit&rsquo;s cover and the surrounding floor to prevent the cover from opening. The cover can also be held in place using an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>
<p>When a weight of 25 pounds or more is placed on the cover, it swings downward (as long as it hasn&rsquo;t been prevented from opening) and remains open until Halaster happens by and decides to close it. Any creature or object on the cover when it swings open falls into the pit below. The pit&rsquo;s depth and other hazards vary by location, as described in the location&rsquo;s description. Regardless of a pit&rsquo;s depth, its walls are too smooth for characters to climb without the aid of climbing gear, magic, or the Spider Climb trait (or a similar ability).</p>
<h4 id=teleport-traps>
<a href=#teleport-traps class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Teleport Traps</h4><p>Teleport traps are at the locations marked T on the map. A teleport trap is a magical effect usually cast on a 10-foot-square section of floor, set to trigger whenever a creature enters the trap&rsquo;s space. The trap extends all the way to the ceiling of the space that contains it.</p>
<p>A teleport trap is <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> to the senses, and a permanent <wc-fetch type=spell>Nystul&rsquo;s magic aura</wc-fetch> spell prevents divination spells such as <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> from revealing the trap&rsquo;s presence. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 18) cast on the trapped section of floor destroys the trap.</p>
<p>A creature that enters the trap&rsquo;s space is teleported along with any objects it is wearing or carrying to another teleport trap (or the nearest unoccupied space). There is no saving throw to resist the teleportation effect, and the destination varies from trap to trap. Once a creature has been teleported in this way, it is unaffected by teleport traps on this level for 1 hour.</p>
<p>When a creature is teleported by a trap, Halaster&rsquo;s booming voice shouts &ldquo;Teleported!&rdquo; in Common. The magical voice originates at the point of departure and the point of arrival, and it is audible in both locations out to a range of 100 feet.</p>
<p>Some teleport traps have additional effects, as described in their encounter locations.</p>

To ensure that every member of a split party gets attention, think of yourself as a film editor cutting scenes in a movie. Jump from one group of characters to the next while spending no more than a few minutes with any given group or individual. Tense moments are great times to &ldquo;cut&rdquo; from one group to another—don&rsquo;t be afraid to leave them hanging!</p>

The effect can&rsquo;t be dispelled, and its exact point of origin can&rsquo;t be ascertained. The play-by-play can be silenced for good by destroying the source in <strong>area area 30b</strong> or by defeating the death tyrant Netherskull. Improvise the play-by-play as you see fit. The commentary tends to be sarcastic, biting, and demoralizing. A few examples of what the disembodied voice might say are provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>When a character misses with a melee attack roll</strong>: &ldquo;Swing and a miss!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When a character misses with a ranged attack roll</strong>: &ldquo;Missed that one by a mile!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When a character takes damage</strong>: &ldquo;Ouch, that&rsquo;ll leave a mark!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When the characters kill a monster</strong>: &ldquo;Score one for the underdogs!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When the party cleric drops to 0 hit points</strong>: &ldquo;The cleric is down! Stick a fork in it—this party&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Tunnel exits to the north and south are flanked by 12-foot-tall stone statues of Halaster Blackcloak, depicted as a bearded, scowling old wizard wearing a robe covered with lidless eyes and clutching a stout scepter with a red dragon&rsquo;s head at each end.</p>
<p><strong>Mine Carts</strong>. Two mine carts made of corroded iron stand near a tunnel exit in the east wall.</p>

<p><strong>Ceilings</strong>. The central portion of this chamber has a domed ceiling 20 feet high. Wings to the east and west have 15-foot-high arched ceilings.</p>
<p><strong>Crevasse</strong>. Orange light and intense heat spill from a crevasse that splits the room nearly in two. (The source of the light is a river of lava 30 feet below, which widens toward the southeast, originating in <strong>area area 40d</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Statues</strong>. Two life-size iron statues of mind flayers sit in opposite corners of the central chamber, facing one another with their tentacles outstretched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Halaster placed the mind flayer statues here and trapped them. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals auras of abjuration and evocation magic around each one. It doesn&rsquo;t require an ability check to realize that a humanoid head would fit nicely inside each mind flayer&rsquo;s tentacles.</p>
<p>Any humanoid that passes between the statues must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> by the statues for 1 minute. The <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> creature must use all of its movement on its turn to move toward the nearest statue and stick its head between the tentacles. (A Small humanoid must climb the front of the statue to do so.) Only one creature at a time can place its head between the tentacles. A humanoid that places its head between the tentacles is no longer <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> but is <wc-fetch type=condition>stunned</wc-fetch> and remains so until another creature separates it from the statue or until the statue is destroyed.</p>
<p>Each statue is rooted to the floor and is a Medium object with AC 19, 40 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage.</p>

<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. A northwest alcove contains a secret door that opens into <strong>area area 5d</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statue holds five gold-painted stone coins in its outstretched hand. Close inspection reveals that one of the coins is loose and can be removed from the statue&rsquo;s hand. Engraved on each side of the loose coin is Halaster&rsquo;s rune. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the coin, and an <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals its magical property.</p>
<p>When an elder rune triggers within 60 feet of the creature that possesses the coin, the creature can use its reaction and the coin to change the elder rune&rsquo;s bane effect into a boon effect, or vice versa. After the coin is used once, it disappears in a flash, accompanied by Halaster&rsquo;s booming laugh.</p>

<p>The statue depicts Deep Duerra, the duergar god of conquest and psionics. Recognizing this sinister figure requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check; dwarves (including duergar) have advantage on the check.

Fidelio&rsquo;s Folly</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Chasm</strong>. This partially destroyed room is dimly lit by the lava at the bottom of the nearby chasm (see <strong>area area 40</strong>). Past the chasm&rsquo;s ledge is a spectral bridge that connects two other partially destroyed chambers (see <strong>area area 16</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Peeling Paint</strong>. The vibrant green paint that once adorned the walls has mostly peeled off from the chasm&rsquo;s extreme heat.</p>
<p><strong>Ghost</strong>. As one or more characters attempt to cross the room, the ghost of Fidelio, a human paladin of Tyr, appears in the middle of the room. The air around it reeks of cheap cologne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fidelio&rsquo;s ghost has 80 hit points and appears as a translucent knight in shining armor, with the symbol of Tyr (a set of balanced scales) on his ghostly breastplate. The ghost is lawful good and speaks in Common. If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it re-forms 24 hours later in a random location within the Obstacle Course and remains there until encountered again.</p>
<p>Over a century ago, Fidelio began his campaign to single-handedly rid Undermountain of evil, foolishly believing that Tyr would not let him perish. The arrogant paladin fought his way down to the Obstacle Course, only to be disintegrated unceremoniously by Netherskull. Fidelio&rsquo;s convictions are so strong, however, that his spirit cannot rest until it defeats Netherskull in battle. The ghost has confronted the death tyrant many times on its own, but these battles are always short-lived, ending with Netherskull destroying the ghost and causing it to re-form elsewhere in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Fidelio&rsquo;s ghost is looking for a potential host who is willing to be possessed by it. A character who allows the possession forgoes the saving throw to resist the effect, and you can allow the player to continue running the character. While possessed, the character gains the following flaw, which supersedes any conflicting personality trait: &ldquo;I, Fidelio, favored son of Tyr, must strike down Netherskull at all costs, as justice demands.&rdquo; The character also reeks of cheap cologne while possessed.</p>
<p>His arrogance aside, Fidelio won&rsquo;t possess a humanoid without its consent. If it can&rsquo;t find a willing host, it offers to join the party on two conditions: the characters must seek out Netherskull with haste, combat it, and allow Fidelio to deal the death blow to it. The ghost knows the location of the death tyrant&rsquo;s lair (<strong>area area 39c</strong>) but doesn&rsquo;t know how to open the doors that lead to it, or about the secret way in (<strong>area area 39b</strong>).</p>
<p>If Netherskull is reduced to 0 hit points by a creature other than Fidelio&rsquo;s ghost or its host, the paladin of Tyr can&rsquo;t accept that someone other than he dealt the killing blow. The ghost wallows in despair, doomed to haunt the Obstacle Course until another follower of Tyr convinces it to move on with a successful DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check. A non-follower can attempt the check, but only by posing as a Tyr worshiper and fooling the ghost with a successful DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>If it succeeds in reducing Netherskull to 0 hit points, either as a ghost or when in possession of a host, Fidelio&rsquo;s ghost is laid to rest. &ldquo;Victory at last!&rdquo; says the ghost as it fades away. Afterward, Tyr bestows a <em>blessing of protection</em> (see &ldquo;Supernatural Gifts&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide) on any character who served as Fidelio&rsquo;s host.</p>
<p>For laying Fidelio&rsquo;s spirit to rest, the characters should receive XP as if they had defeated the ghost in combat.</p>

Hidden Rune</h3><p>This 20-foot-high chamber shows signs of past extravagance. It has the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chasm</strong>. The floor to the north gives way to a chasm and a hot, bubbling pool of lava 30 feet below. Intense heat from the lava fills this room.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge</strong>. A 10-foot-wide spectral bridge—nothing more than a flat plane of wispy, magical force—extends across the chasm from this room to another ledge 120 feet away. (For more information on the bridge, see <strong>area area 16</strong>. The far ledge is described in <strong>area area 17</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Double Door</strong>. At the south end of the room, two pillars carved with scores of eyes flank a stone double door engraved with a giant letter H.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If their handles are tugged, the double doors fly open, revealing a stone wall with a giant elder rune carved into it (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>"). Draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B) to determine which rune waits beyond the doors. This rune targets all creatures in the room with the same effect (bane or boon, determined randomly). If Halaster&rsquo;s personal rune is indicated, an additional effect occurs: the pillars flanking the doorway shoot multicolored rays from their eyes, and each creature in the room becomes the target of a <wc-fetch type=spell>prismatic spray</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 22). Once this effect is resolved, the elder rune on the wall disappears, and the doors slam shut unless they are held open or otherwise prevented from closing.</p>
<p>When the doors close, the trap resets so that the next time the doors open, another randomly determined elder rune appears on the wall behind them.</p>

<p>The rolling statue is designed to fit snugly in the dungeon&rsquo;s 10-foot-wide passageways. It is a Large object with AC 17, 120 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage.</p>

Any creature in the path of the rolling statue, including the one teleported by the trap, must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to get out of its way.

<p>The rotting corpse of a drow mage lies slumped against a wall at the end of the tunnel, his face frozen in a scream, his black robe torn and dusty.

<p><strong>Unseen Servant</strong>. Standing silently in the northwest corner is a living unseen servant (see appendix A).</p>

<p>The rusty iron wheel can be rotated a half turn in either direction, squealing loudly until it clicks to a stop. Turning the wheel causes mechanisms under the floor to clank and whir, locking the lids of all the covered pits on this level and deactivating all the teleport traps on this level. Resetting the wheel to its original position reactivates these traps.</p>
<p>The living unseen servant doesn&rsquo;t announce its presence to anyone. If the characters turn the wheel but fail to destroy the unseen servant, it waits until they leave the room before using the wheel to reactivate the traps on this level.</p>

Southern Crypt</h4><p>The door to this room is engraved with a large rune, while the door frame is carved with leering dwarven skulls. A character who understands Dwarvish recognizes the rune on the door as a dwarven symbol of death (identical to the one in <strong>area area 27</strong>).</p>
<p>Behind the door is a dusty, 10-foot-high crypt that contains the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarcophagi</strong>. Three open stone sarcophagi rest in the middle of the crypt, their lids lying in pieces on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Skeletons</strong>. Piled against the back wall are scores of moldering dwarf skeletons (inanimate and harmless).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pair of drow mages and siblings named Elvilac and Lorlynn searched and plundered the sarcophagi. Each sarcophagus rests atop a 1-foot-tall stone bier and is 7 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 3 feet tall. The contents of the sarcophagi are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The northern sarcophagus contains the moldy bones of a dwarf with corroded bits of armor clinging to it. Its skull is hidden inside a rusty bucket helm.</li>
<li>The middle sarcophagus is empty, but a body-shaped impression in the dust suggests that someone rested here recently. (Elvilac, the dead drow in area 11, rested here while he meditated.)</li>
<li>The southern sarcophagus contains the bones and tattered robe of a long-dead mind flayer.</li>
</ul>

Northern Crypt</h4><p>The door to this room is identical to the one guarding <strong>area area 14a</strong>, except for a triangular hole at the bottom. Behind the door is a dusty, 10-foot-high crypt containing the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Skeletons and Sarcophagi</strong>. Twelve dwarf Skeleton mill aimlessly around three unmarked stone sarcophagi in the middle of this crypt.</p>
<p><strong>Lorlynn</strong>. The southern sarcophagus is missing its lid. A female drow mage named Lorlynn Zmirth rests inside. She sits up when intruders enter the crypt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lorlynn came to Undermountain with her twin brother Elvilac in hopes of finding useful spellbooks and magic. Netherskull has chosen to leave her alone for the time being. Her brother wasn&rsquo;t so fortunate (see <strong>area area 11</strong>). Lorlynn doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s dead and is expecting him to return any moment, but news of his death doesn&rsquo;t upset her. So gloomy a creature was he that if Lorlynn can recover and animate his corpse, it will be as though he never died.</p>
<p>Lorlynn wears a tattered gray spider silk robe and cowl that, coupled with her gaunt features, makes her appear distinctly banshee-like. She abhors the company of other humanoids except her brother. She is in a relaxing trance when the characters first arrive. Normally indifferent toward adventurers, she turns hostile if she finds that the characters have her brother&rsquo;s spellbook and refuse to surrender it to her. If her skeletons are turned or destroyed and she is reduced to half her hit points or fewer, Lorlynn offers information in exchange for her life. She knows one random Undermountain secret, determined by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C). She also knows how to deactivate the pit traps and teleport traps on this level using the wheel in <strong>area area 12</strong>, but knows nothing of the living unseen servant that Halaster recently put there.</p>
<p>Each sarcophagus sits atop a 1-foot-tall stone bier and is 7 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 3 feet tall. A character with a Strength score of 15 or higher can push off the lid of a sarcophagus easily. The contents of each sarcophagus are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The northern sarcophagus has a gaping crack in one of its sides, and four harmless rats have used this crack to creep inside and make a nest among the moldering bones of a sahuagin (placed here by Halaster to confound grave robbers). Lifting the lid or tapping on the sarcophagus causes <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> rats to emerge in a panic. The detritus in the nest includes two random trinkets, determined by rolling on the <wc-fetch type=item>Trinket</wc-fetch> table in chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook.</li>
<li>The middle sarcophagus is full of cobwebs, hidden under which is a right-handed iron gauntlet with six fingers. Characters can use the gauntlet to activate the gate in <strong>area area 24c</strong>.</li>
<li>The southern sarcophagus (Lorlynn&rsquo;s bed) has a secret compartment in the bottom that can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Its contents are described in &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below.</li>

<p><strong>Debris</strong>. What&rsquo;s left of the floor is strewn with broken, corroded fragments of dwarf-sized chain mail and plate armor.</p>
<p><strong>Arch</strong>. Embedded in the middle of the south wall is a stone arch made up of one hundred stone jigsaw pieces. This arch is one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gates</strong>").</p>

The rules of this gate are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one piece of the arch can be removed at any given time. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that one of the pieces (determined randomly) is magical. When that piece is removed from the arch, it disappears, and the gate opens for 1 minute. When the gate closes, the piece removed from the arch magically reappears in its proper place, and a different piece becomes magical and must be removed to reopen the gate.</li>
<li>If a wrong piece is removed from the arch, an adult white dragon magically appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the arch and attacks any creature it can see. The dragon disappears when it is slain or after 1 minute. When the dragon disappears, the piece that was removed from the arch magically reappears in its previous place.</li>
<li>Characters must be at least 16th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 9b on level 20</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>

Spectral Bridge</h3><p>A 120-foot-long, 10-foot-wide bridge of wispy magical energy spans the lava-filled chasm, connecting areas 9 and 17. This bridge provides a relatively safe means of crossing the chasm, particularly given that the chasm suppresses <wc-fetch type=spell>fly</wc-fetch> spells and similar magic (see <strong>area area 40</strong>).</p>
<p>The bridge, suspended 30 feet above the surface of the lava, is flat, translucent, and without railings. Normally, it is solid and safe to walk on—but any section of the bridge within 10 feet of a magic item becomes insubstantial. A creature or object passes through an insubstantial section of the bridge like it&rsquo;s not there. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell cast on the bridge (DC 18) causes the entire span to disappear for 1 hour.</p>
<p>In order to retain their magic items as they cross the bridge, the characters must devise a way to distance the items from the bridge as they cross it, such as by tying the items to ropes and dangling them more than 10 feet from the span.</p>

The effect is that of a <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 19) cast using a 7th-level spell slot. It deals 42 (<wc-roll>12d6</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

Grabby Pillars</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Ropers</strong>. Three Roper are disguised as 10-foot-tall pillars of rough-hewn stone that extend from floor to ceiling. Lying on the floor between the pillars is a key of bone. Set into each pillar at a height of 7 feet is a lidded eye fixed on the key. (These are the ropers' actual eyes, which appear still and lifeless.)</p>
<p><strong>Frescoes</strong>. The walls are covered with faded frescoes that depict Underdark caverns and fungi forests.</p>
<p><strong>Teleport Trap</strong>. A teleport trap (see &ldquo;<strong>area Teleport Traps</strong>") fills the space marked on the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 6-inch-long key is carved from a dragon&rsquo;s finger bone, and its yellow head is shaped like an H. This key unlocks the doors to <strong>area area 39c</strong>. A similar key can be found in <strong>area area 30b</strong>.</p>
<p>The ropers remain still and hold their pillar-like shapes until the key is disturbed or until one or more of the ropers is attacked or poked in the eye, whereupon all three sprout tendrils and attack all other creatures in the room. The ropers ignore intruders otherwise, since Halaster keeps them well fed.</p>

Zerths</h4><p>The door to this room is ajar. Characters who approach stealthily might overhear the githzerai speaking quietly inside. The room&rsquo;s features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Githzerai</strong>. Four Githzerai Zerth are having a hushed conversation in the middle of the room, speaking Gith. They stop talking and ready themselves for combat if they detect intruders.</p>
<p><strong>Arch</strong>. A stone arch is embedded in the middle of the south wall. Carved into the arch&rsquo;s keystone is an image of a six-fingered gauntlet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The zerths include Yrlakka, the group&rsquo;s leader, and three of his pupils: two female githzerai named Azal and Vond, and a male named Rishindar. Yrlakka&rsquo;s primary concern is the safe return of his missing pupil, Ezria, who he believes was captured while scouting the githyanki forces on level 16. If the characters agree to find Ezria, Yrlakka and his remaining pupils tag along unless the characters would rather complete the quest by themselves. If Ezria is rescued and reunited with his companions, Yrlakka rewards the characters with the wand in his possession (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>

This gate&rsquo;s rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature touches the arch with a six-fingered gauntlet (one can be found in <strong>area area 14b</strong>).</li>
<li>Characters must be 14th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>
<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in <strong>area area 7a on level 17</strong>, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</li>
</ul>
<p>The githzerai have correctly deduced that a six-fingered gauntlet is required to activate the gate but don&rsquo;t know where to find such an item. (The characters can locate one in area 14b. A character proficient with smith&rsquo;s tools can also fashion one out of scrap metal in a tenday using an intact forge.)</p>

<p>What looks like a large iron book lies facedown on the floor in the northeast corner. Closer inspection reveals that the object is a cast-iron mold for smelting metal ingots.

Mark of Death</h3><p>Halaster captured a dwarf vampire named Zorak Lightdrinker and magically bound him here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Open Pit</strong>. A 20-foot-long, 40-foot-deep pit spans the width of the corridor. Blood stains the pit&rsquo;s sheer walls, which are too smooth to climb without climbing gear, magic, or a trait such as Spider Climb.</p>
<p><strong>Sarcophagus</strong>. At the bottom of the pit rests a 6-foot-long, 3-foot-wide alabaster sarcophagus draped in cobwebs. Its lid is carved to resemble a giant bat with folded wings. (The sarcophagus contains a vampire.) Floating above the vessel is a magic rune that glows as bright as a candle flame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A character who understands Dwarvish recognizes the glowing, magical rune as a dwarven symbol of death (identical to the one inscribed on the door to <strong>area area 14a</strong>). The first time a creature crosses from one side of the pit to the other, the rune disappears and imprints itself as a death mark on a visible portion of the creature&rsquo;s face or body. The mark disappears when its bearer dies or when the vampire is destroyed. Only a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell or a deity can remove a death mark otherwise.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus at the bottom of the pit is a 2,000-pound chunk of hollowed-out alabaster. Zorak Lightdrinker, a vampire in mist form, is trapped inside. When the death mark is imprinted on a creature, the sarcophagus crumbles to dust and Zorak is released. The sarcophagus is otherwise indestructible.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>geas</wc-fetch> spell cast by Halaster compels Zorak to hunt down and destroy the creature bearing the death mark, singling out that target above all others. Zorak knows the exact location of the marked creature while the two of them are on the same plane of existence. Slaying the bearer of the death mark frees Zorak from Halaster&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>geas</wc-fetch> spell, whereupon the vampire seeks to return to his true lair in the Underdark.</p>
<p>If a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell is cast on the rune (DC 19) before it imprints on a creature, the rune disappears for 1 minute, allowing creatures to cross the pit in the meantime without the rune imprinting on any of them.</p>

Underbrew in Chains</h4><p>Affixed to the back wall of the western alcove is a stone-framed painting of a scarred male dwarf wearing black plate armor. He is bound by heavy iron chains and shackles anchored to the floor of a dreary dungeon cell. The painting is 3½ feet wide by 7 feet tall.</p>
<p>Thanks to a permanent <wc-fetch type=spell>Nystul&rsquo;s magic aura</wc-fetch> spell cast on the painting, a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell does not reveal that the painting is magical. It is a magical prison that can hold one humanoid creature at a time. The first humanoid creature that approaches within 5 feet of the painting must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be magically pulled into it, switching places with the dwarf currently trapped inside (see below). A humanoid drawn into the painting finds itself chained in an extradimensional cell 10 feet on a side. While trapped in the cell, the creature is <wc-fetch type=condition>paralyzed</wc-fetch>. The painting has AC 11, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying it frees the trapped creature, which appears in the closest unoccupied space adjacent to the painting.</p>

Halaster defeated Underbrew but offered to spare the dwarf&rsquo;s life if he vowed to serve the Mad Mage as an enforcer, ridding the dungeon of other invaders. Unwilling to face his own mortal end, Underbrew made this vow and convinced himself over time that the executions he performed were acts of mercy, because those he killed would never be forced to turn against their beliefs as he had. In time, these acts stopped weighing on Underbrew&rsquo;s conscience. In fact, the dwarf began to enjoy his grisly work.</p>
<p>Thwad Underbrew is a shield dwarf champion (see appendix A), with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Underbrew is neutral evil.</li>
<li>Instead of a greatsword, he wields a maul (which deals bludgeoning damage instead of slashing damage).</li>
<li>He has these racial traits: He speaks Common and Dwarvish. He has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison.</li>

Netherskull&rsquo;s Biographer</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Arch</strong>. A stone arch decorated with gold-inlaid images of soaring dragons is embedded in the middle of the north wall, atop a 3-foot-high red marble dais. Carved into the wall above the arch are the following words in Draconic: &ldquo;Only a dragon can unlock this gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Gong</strong>. A 3-foot-diameter bronze gong hangs from a sturdy wooden frame anchored to the floor near the west wall. The gong is embossed with carvings of ears of corn. A padded wooden mallet dangles from a hook on one of the support posts.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters</strong>. Sitting on the steps of the dais, scribbling madly in a journal with a quill pen, is a wretchedly pale man in a dusty black robe. He is watched over by two <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> Nycaloth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To flatter Netherskull, Halaster assigned a would-be apprentice to chronicle the death tyrant&rsquo;s history in a series of journals. This biographer is a skittish, ill-bred, and unkempt male human in his thirties named Kavil Mereshanter. Kavil is a mage, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kavil is neutral evil.</li>
<li>He speaks Dwarvish, Common, Giant, and Undercommon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kavil was denied admittance to Dweomercore (level 9), and Halaster robbed him of his spellbook. The Mad Mage has promised to return the book once Kavil completes his work. (In fact, Halaster has misplaced the spellbook, though Kavil is unaware of this.)</p>
<p>As Netherskull&rsquo;s appointed biographer, Kavil is expected to earn the death tyrant&rsquo;s trust, but Netherskull trusts no wizard, and has been reluctant to grant interviews. Kavil has instead filled one journal after another with his own narrative concoctions and self-pitying asides. The biography is a mostly fictionalized, somewhat sensationalized version of Netherskull&rsquo;s life, death, and undeath. Kavil knows that anyone who reads this drivel won&rsquo;t be fooled, but he&rsquo;s hoping the deluge of words will impress Halaster while simultaneously discouraging close examination of the work.</p>
<p>Kavil won&rsquo;t start a fight, but he sides with the nycaloths if a battle erupts, which is likely since the fiends have orders to slay intruders. If reduced to 33 hit points or fewer, Kavil switches sides and offers information in exchange for his life. He knows one random Undermountain secret, determined by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C), as well as a secret way into Netherskull&rsquo;s lair (see <strong>area area 39b</strong>). Kavil isn&rsquo;t aware of the secret door that leads to <strong>area area 30b</strong>.</p>
<p>Characters who spend at least 10 minutes poring over Kavil&rsquo;s journal can piece together bits of Netherskull&rsquo;s history and, with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check, separate out Kavil&rsquo;s gibberish to learn the following truths:</p>
<ul>
<li>The beholder&rsquo;s true name is unknown. It changed its name to Netherskull after becoming a death tyrant.</li>
<li>Netherskull has slain countless interlopers, none more deserving of death than a pompous human paladin named Fidelio, who wept bitter tears before his disintegration.</li>
<li>Netherskull&rsquo;s primary goals are to destroy Halaster and take over Undermountain.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The gate opens for 1 minute when a real or illusory dragon touches the arch. An artistic rendering of a dragon, such as a dragon-shaped figurine or a drawing of a dragon, also opens the gate.</li>
<li>Characters must be at least 15th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

If the gong is struck with the mallet, three items appear on the floor before it: a small clay bowl filled with bland, edible food (hunks of bread and cheese, strips of meat, and dried nuts); an empty tin cup; and a glass carafe containing 1 gallon of water. The items disappear after 1 hour. Removing any of these items from the room also causes them to vanish. Once it is used to summon food and water, the gong can&rsquo;t do so again until the next dawn. If the gong is taken from this room, it loses its magical property.</p>

The surface of the cube facing the secret door bears Halaster&rsquo;s fleshy, grimacing visage.</p>
<p>Disturbing the cube causes it to sprout spindly arms, legs, and wings. It then fights until destroyed. It has the statistics of a quadrone, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cube is chaotic evil.</li>
<li>It speaks Common and is the source of Halaster&rsquo;s play-by-play (see &ldquo;<strong>area Halaster&rsquo;s Play-by-Play</strong>").</li>
<li>Whenever it would normally make a shortbow attack, it instead hurls a magic dart at a target it can see up to 60 feet away from it. Each dart hits its target automatically (no attack roll required) for 5 (<wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll>) force damage.</li>

A character who inspects the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices two things: the statue&rsquo;s jaws are hinged but locked shut, and a tiny keyhole is positioned just above its bulbous eyes. Inserting the proper key into the keyhole causes the statue&rsquo;s hinged mouth to open, as does a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. The mouth can also be opened by a character using thieves' tools who succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check.</p>
<p>Opening the statue&rsquo;s mouth causes a 50-foot rope ladder to tumble out, extending all the way to the bottom of the pit. The ladder is securely attached to a stone bar lodged in the toad&rsquo;s throat, and characters can use it to safely climb in and out of the pit.</p>

<p>In the middle of the cave stands a life-size statue of Halaster with lidless eyes carved into its flowing robe. The statue is a Medium object with AC 17, 45 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A character can topple the statue with a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

Zombie Horde</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Zombies</strong>. The stench of death fills this 20-foot-high cavern, which contains forty Zombie in various states of decay. They shamble about aimlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Sinkhole</strong>. A 70-foot-deep sinkhole has formed near the east wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The zombies are the remains of humanoids killed by Netherskull and animated by its Negative Energy Cone. They include several humans and dwarves, as well as a few elves, drow, tieflings, quaggoths, duergar, hobgoblins, troglodytes, and githyanki. Until Netherskull summons them, the zombies remain here and attack intruders on sight. You can expedite combat by dividing the zombies into mobs of ten or fewer and using the mob rules in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.</p>

</p>
<p>Adventurers who explore this area are doomed to face Netherskull the death tyrant if they haven&rsquo;t done so already. Netherskull can&rsquo;t be surprised in its lair.</p>

Hanging Beholder Statue</h4><p>Hanging from the 30-foot-high, domed ceiling by three iron chains is a 6-foot-diameter carved stone beholder. Netherskull carved the statue using its carefully manipulated Disintegration Ray, but the rough sculpture is clearly the work of a talentless amateur. Each chain has AC 19, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Breaking all three chains causes the statue to fall and shatter on the floor.</p>

Secret Tunnel</h4><p>This dusty passage circumvents the adamantine doors to Netherskull&rsquo;s lair (see <strong>area area 39c</strong>) and is hidden behind two secret doors. The death tyrant uses its Telekinetic Ray to open and close the secret doors when it comes and goes through this tunnel.</p>

Death Tyrant</h4><p>All doors leading to this area are 1-foot-thick, 7-foot-diameter adamantine disks molded to look like concentric rings of bones with a leering human skull at the center. The skull&rsquo;s nose cavity contains an adamantine keyhole. When one of Halaster&rsquo;s bone keys (see <strong>area areas 19</strong> and <strong>area 30b</strong>) is inserted into the lock and turned 90 degrees clockwise, four bolt locks slide back from the surrounding walls, and the door swings inward on adamantine hinges. The door remains open until it is closed, and the key can be removed at any time. Without the proper key, it takes four separate <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spells to open one of these doors, each spell causing one bolt to slide back. The doors are otherwise impregnable.</p>
<p>There is no keyhole on the inside of the doors. Instead, each door has an adamantine wheel in the middle of it that must be turned counterclockwise to slide back the bolts. This wheel can also be used as a handle to pull the heavy door open. When Netherskull wants to leave the room through a door, it uses its Telekinetic Ray to turn the wheel and leaves the door open until it returns.</p>

Netherskull seeks to destroy intruders and animate their corpses, turning them into zombie thralls. It calls forth the zombies in <strong>area area 38</strong> (assuming they haven&rsquo;t been defeated) and commands them to attack all intruders.</p>
<p>If the characters haven&rsquo;t silenced the level&rsquo;s play-by-play announcer (see &ldquo;<strong>area Halaster&rsquo;s Play-by-Play</strong>"), it becomes increasingly excited as the battle with the death tyrant unfolds. If they defeat Netherskull, the announcer screams, &ldquo;How could this happen?! This is unbelievable! This might be the greatest upset in the history of Undermountain!&rdquo; It then falls silent for the rest of the time the characters spend on this level.</p>

Netherskull&rsquo;s Chasm</h3><p>The death tyrant carved out this immense chasm using its Disintegration Ray, and Halaster added his own touches by flooding it with lava and confounding magical flight within the chasm.</p>
<p>Spells and magic items that allow creatures to fly are suppressed within the chasm. Any character who enters the chasm under the effect of a <wc-fetch type=spell>fly</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic goes hurtling down into the lava. Spells that slow one&rsquo;s fall (such as <wc-fetch type=spell>feather fall</wc-fetch>) function normally.</p>
<p>Creatures who spend 1 hour or longer in the chasm or in any of the areas open to it are susceptible to the effects of extreme heat (as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). The chasm is brightly lit by the lava, which fills the bottom of the chasm to a depth of 20 feet. A creature that enters the lava for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 55 (<wc-roll>10d10</wc-roll>) fire damage.</p>
<p>The surface of the lava is 30 feet below the floor level of the Obstacle Course. The walls in between are sloped and have abundant handholds and footholds. Climbing them requires a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check; on a check that fails by 5 or more, the creature slips and falls into the lava.</p>

Magma Mephits</h4><p>Four Magma Mephit lounge in this small lava pool. If the characters parley with the mephits in a language they understand, the mephits try to lure the characters toward <strong>area area 39c</strong>, hoping they&rsquo;ll either kill Netherskull or die in the attempt. The mephits detest the death tyrant and care only about their own well-being.</p>

Teleport Trap Destination</h4><p>A creature teleported to this location by another teleport trap appears 30 feet above the lava and immediately plunges into it unless the creature has some way to stop the fall. (Remember that spells and magic items that allow creatures to fly are suppressed within the chasm.)</p>
<p>Unlike other teleport traps in the Obstacle Course, this trap doesn&rsquo;t teleport creatures to other locations.</p>

If intruders are detected, the mephits incite the lava children into climbing up the walls to attack the new arrivals, while the mephits use their breath weapons and keep their distance.</p>

Eventually he settles on abducting several beholders, releasing them in the Obstacle Course, and letting them vie for control of the level until only one remains. Halaster plans to help the winner transform itself into a new death tyrant.</p>
<p>Although most of the Obstacle Course&rsquo;s remaining inhabitants have no intention of leaving anytime soon, the githzerai stay only as long as they must to reunite with their missing comrade and ensure the destruction of the mind flayer colony on level 17.</p>
