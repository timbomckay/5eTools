<p>Maddgoth&rsquo;s Castle is designed for four 9th-level characters, who should amass enough XP to reach 10th level. The characters can forge tenuous alliances with several of the monsters on this level. Award XP for these creatures as if the characters had defeated them in combat.</p>
<p>The level is named after a miniature, one-twelfth-scale fortress in one of its caverns. This castle serves as the home base of Maddgoth, a serial killer who lures other wizards to his lair to murder them and keep their arcane focuses and spellbooks as trophies. Maddgoth isn&rsquo;t home when the adventurers first arrive, but he might show up later (see &ldquo;<strong>area Aftermath</strong>"). Most creatures are reduced to one-twelfth their normal size as they approach Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle, enabling them to better fit inside. Either by design or because of some failing, the shrinking magic doesn&rsquo;t affect all creatures, as adventurers who explore the castle will discover.</p>

While he&rsquo;s away, his homunculus watches over his castle. A faerie dragon has also discovered the castle and claimed it as its lair. To reach the castle, adventurers must travel through caverns inhabited by a family of forgetful stone giants.</p>

The giants remember who they are and can recall events that happened within the last 8 hours, but everything that occurred before then is lost in a haze and soon forgotten. All their memories of the surface world and its inhabitants faded long ago.</p>
<p>The stone giants are irritable and self-serving, but not evil. They treat any invasion by humanoids as a vermin infestation, nothing more, and attempts to parley with them fall on deaf ears for the most part. They are unaware of the miniature castle in the heart of their domain because it floats in the middle of a great cavern beyond the range of their <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>The giants are tormented by the faerie dragon that lairs in Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle. It emerges while <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and uses illusion spells to close off passages, create false tunnels, and make temporary alterations to the giants' caves. The faerie dragon&rsquo;s mischief has only heightened the stone giants' irritability, and the giants, having never seen the creature, suspect that the characters might be responsible. To earn the giants' trust, characters must determine the cause of the mischief and put an end to it. Even if they succeed, however, their efforts are soon forgotten as Halaster&rsquo;s magic erodes the giants' memories.</p>
<p>The oldest stone giants, Gravillok and Speleosa, are mates. They have four adult children: two sons, Qurrok and Rhodos, and two daughters, Obsidia and Xorta.</p>

Upon discovering Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle, Otto decided to move in. The faerie dragon was unaffected by the castle&rsquo;s shrinking magic and settled comfortably into its new home. It feeds on bats and other vermin it finds in the surrounding cavern.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s bored, the faerie dragon sneaks out invisibly and uses its spells to make illusory modifications to the stone giants' caves, confounding the giants for its own amusement. The giants have no clue who or what is responsible for this magical mischief.</p>
<p>The faerie dragon would like to get rid of Maddgoth&rsquo;s homunculus, which has become a troublesome reminder of the castle&rsquo;s true owner. Otto has defeated the homunculus in physical combat more than once, but it keeps coming back. The dragon has concluded that the only way to get rid of the homunculus for good is to forcibly remove it from the castle and trap it elsewhere. If the characters do this for the faerie dragon, Otto allows them to use the castle for rest and relaxationâ€”provided they don&rsquo;t overstay their welcome or loot the joint.</p>

It has a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP) and the following statistical changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Otto is Large and has 104 (<wc-roll>16d10 + 16</wc-roll>) hit points.</li>
<li>It has a Strength score of 18 (+4), and its bite attack deals 11 (<wc-roll>2d6 + 4</wc-roll>) piercing damage on a hit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otto turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and flees if reduced to half its hit points or fewer. It tries to find a hiding place in the castle but abandons the structure if it must. When encountered outside the castle, Otto has the size and statistics of a normal violet Faerie Dragon (Violet). Whenever Otto&rsquo;s relative size decreases, any hit points beyond its new hit point maximum are lost. Whenever Otto&rsquo;s relative size increases, any damage that Otto has taken remains and is subtracted from its new hit point maximum.</p>

The fact that it hasn&rsquo;t perished suggests that Maddgoth is still alive, but their telepathic bond has been severed, indicating that the two are no longer on the same plane of existence. Whether this separation is of Maddgoth&rsquo;s choosing is unknown. The wizard could be sequestered in a demiplane, imprisoned in a <wc-fetch type=item>mirror of life trapping</wc-fetch>, or touring the Abyss, for all anyone knows.</p>
<p>The lonely homunculus longs to be reunited with its creator. It also wants to rid Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle of the faerie dragon that has invaded it. The characters can impress the homunculus and earn its trust by killing the faerie dragon or scaring it away for good. The homunculus can&rsquo;t leave the castle, by order of its master. If it takes damage that would normally destroy it, it forms anew in Maddgoth&rsquo;s study (<strong>area area 25a</strong>). Only the wizard&rsquo;s death can destroy the homunculus for good.</p>

<li>It understands Abyssal, Common, Draconic, and Gnomish, but can&rsquo;t speak.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the homunculus is forcibly taken from the castle, its relative size reverts to Tiny, and its statistics become those of a normal homunculus. Whenever the creature&rsquo;s relative size decreases, any hit points beyond its new hit point maximum are lost. Whenever its relative size increases, any damage that it has taken remains and is subtracted from its new hit point maximum.</p>

The stone giants don&rsquo;t like the damage that the umber hulks cause and scare them off as best they can.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, all chambers on this level are rough-hewn (not naturally formed) and have 30-foot-high ceilings. Wider passages are 20 feet tallâ€”ideal for the 18-foot-tall stone giants that dwell here. Narrower tunnels are 5 feet wide and 8 feet tallâ€”too small for the giants to fit inside. All caves and tunnels are unlit, since the giants rely on <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> to see.</p>

<p><strong>Carvings</strong>. Abstract carvings cover the walls, and chiseled bits of stone lie scattered across the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters catch him by surprise or greet him with hostility, Gravillok retreats to <strong>area area 13</strong> while shouting out to his family in Giant, &ldquo;Invasion! Arm yourselves! We&rsquo;re under attack!&rdquo; Gravillok&rsquo;s deep bellow echoes throughout the level. To the best of his recollection, Gravillok has never seen small folk before. His instinct is to treat them as vermin and smoosh them with his greatclub. If they attempt to parley and he can understand them, he stops attacking long enough to listen to their words, then discounts them, concluding that the interlopers must be responsible for the strange magic bedeviling his family. The characters will have to work hard to change his mind.</p>
<p>In addition to his greatclub, Gravillok carries a favorite chisel, much too large for Medium or smaller characters to use as an effective tool.</p>
<p>A successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check identifies Gravillok&rsquo;s wall carving as a 30-foot-tall image of Skoraeus Stonebones, the stone giant god. Gravillok hopes that Skoraeus will be honored by the carving enough to help him catch whoever has been tormenting his family.</p>

<p><strong>Descending Tunnel</strong>. The tunnel to the southeast descends hundreds of feet to level 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, before the arrival of the stone giants, an adventurer used a mirror to trick the basilisk into targeting itself with its own petrifying gaze. It has remained a fixture of this cavern ever since. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic emanating from within the basilisk&rsquo;s belly. One must smash open the basilisk to get at the treasure inside. Its belly can be cracked open with a solid weapon hit.</p>

<p>The stone giants eat the crystals that grow in this chamber. Ten pounds of crystals provide a giant with the equivalent of a nutritious meal. The crystal formations regrow at a steady pace, thanks to Halaster&rsquo;s magic. Most humanoids would not consider them edible.</p>

<p><strong>Rocks</strong>. Strewn upon the uneven floor amid mounds of bat guano are loose rocks that Xorta hurls at intruders and others who bother her.</p>
<p>Xorta reclines in the north alcove, partially hidden behind natural columns of rock. She uses her Stone Camouflage trait to blend in with her surroundings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Xorta has a mind to explore more of Undermountain, but her parents won&rsquo;t let her stray far. She lacks the courage to defy them and knows they won&rsquo;t let her leave. She has a 4-foot-long stone flute and likes to play it here because the acoustics are favorable. She&rsquo;s still learning how to play, though, and often forgets her own lessons. Xorta doesn&rsquo;t remember who crafted the flute (she did) or how it became magical, but she knows that the giant bats enjoy it.</p>
<p>If Xorta is attacked, she can use an action to play a few notes on her flute and cause the giant bats to swoop down and attack her enemies until she plays the flute again to call them off. The stone flute is too large for Medium or smaller creatures to play, and only Xorta can use its magical power.</p>

<p><strong>Corpses</strong>. Dozens of humanoid corpses in varying stages of putrefaction, including a few reduced to moldy bones, lie stacked like cordwood against the walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stone giants have met Halaster several times over the years and carved his visage after many of those occasions. Though the giants' memories of him never last, the faces in this cavern remain.</p>
<p>The giants have begun using the cavern to store the bodies of creatures they&rsquo;re forced to kill. With the duergar and the drow returning to Undermountain in force and the bullywugs on level 8 becoming more aggressive, such encounters have become commonplace. Again, the giants have no memory of these altercations, and they have no use for the dead creatures' gear.</p>
<p>The corpses include a drow, two quaggoths, five troglodytes, seven hobgoblins, three duergar, six grimlocks, nine bullywugs, and two humans (former members of an adventuring party). The stone giants tossed the creatures' weapons into the nearby silt pit (<strong>area area 11b</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Carvings and Loose Rocks</strong>. The walls and domed roof display carvings of stone giants. At the foot of each carving is a pile of loose rocks.</p>
<p><strong>Speleosa</strong>. Unless she is interrupted, Speleosa the stone giant is sitting in the middle of the cave and using a patch of bat fur to polish amber gemstones.</p>
<p><strong>Otto</strong>. Otto the Faerie Dragon (Violet) shows up to create mischief shortly after the characters arrive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Speleosa detects intruders in her home, she grabs loose rocks from the piles around the room, instructs Obsidia and Rhodos (see <strong>area area 13a</strong>) to do the same, and sets out to destroy the invaders. Attempting to reason with Speleosa while she&rsquo;s hurling rocks is no simple matter, and she isn&rsquo;t receptive to bribes. If one or more of her children are imperiled, Speleosa becomes calm and begins negotiating for their safe release.</p>
<p>While the characters are dealing with Speleosa, the <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> faerie dragon flies into the cavern, becomes visible momentarily as it casts the <wc-fetch type=spell>hallucinatory terrain</wc-fetch> spell, and turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> again as a bonus action. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 17 or higher glimpse the wee dragon for a second before it turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>. On subsequent turns, Otto flies back to Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle. Otto&rsquo;s spell replaces all of areas <strong>area 10</strong>, <strong>area 12</strong>, and <strong>area 13</strong> with a sylvan forest. The cavern walls remain but are masked by the illusion. Any stone giants in the affected area find themselves in wholly unfamiliar terrain and become panicky. Their inclination is to blame the characters, and dispelling the faerie dragon&rsquo;s magic does little to console them. If the characters don&rsquo;t flee, the giants attack them out of fear.</p>

Central Cavern</h3><p>This 180-foot-diameter spherical cavern has a domed ceiling and a bowl-shaped floor. Along its perimeter are stone ledges (<strong>area area 16a</strong>) that don&rsquo;t quite encircle the chamber. Any creature knocked off a ledge goes tumbling down the inward-sloping rock walls to the bottom of the cavern (<strong>area area 16b</strong>), which is strewn with rocks, bones, and the bodies of two dead umber hulks.</p>
<p>At the center of the cavern, floating 10 feet above a smooth, 80-foot-tall mithral spindle that erupts from the floor, is Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle. The stone castle is more than 60 feet away from the ledges, putting it outside the range of some creatures' <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch>. The stone giants have never noticed it for this reason.</p>
<p>The castle looks small enough to fit in a 20-foot-cube, and it floats at the center of an <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> 40-foot-radius sphere of transmutation magic that shrinks all creatures and objects in its area to one-twelfth their normal size. A 6-foot-tall person becomes a 6-inch-tall person, for example. Characters who enter the sphere can tell something has happened when Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle suddenly looms twelve times larger in their vision.</p>
<p>A shrunken creature or object reverts to its normal size once it leaves the sphere, which is generated by the mithral spindle. No saving throw is allowed to resist the shrinking effect, and nothing short of divine intervention can suppress the spindle&rsquo;s magic. The spindle is impervious to damage, and it generates a magical repulsion field that prevents creatures from approaching any closer to it than 5 feet.</p>
<p>When Halaster created the mithral spindle, he exempted certain creatures and objects from its shrinking effect. The spindle itself is unaffected, as is Maddgoth&rsquo;s homunculus. Faerie dragons are also immune to the shrinking effect, and there might be other creatures and objects that are unaffected as well, based solely on the Mad Mage&rsquo;s whims.</p>

<p><strong>Qurrok</strong>. If no one has raised an alarm, Qurrok the stone giant is searching the cavern floor for interesting rocks and gem deposits.</p>
<p><strong>Corpses</strong>. Amid the rocks on the cavern floor are the rotting corpses of two umber hulks killed by Qurrok in the western caves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Qurrok&rsquo;s body is a temple, and he has honed and shaped it to perfection. His extensive physical training gives him advantage on all Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</p>
<p>Every time Qurrok loses his memory, he forgets about his previous excursions to the bottom of this cavern. He lowers himself to the floor, discovers the mithral spindle, and tries to climb it to see what&rsquo;s at the top. Rebuffed and discouraged by the repulsion field that surrounds the spindle, he starts combing the cavern floor for treasure.</p>
<p>When an alarm sounds in the caverns around this area, Qurrok climbs up to the ledge closest to the disturbance. If doing that puts him anywhere near his pet cave bears in <strong>area area 14</strong>, he summons them to his side with a booming, bear-like roar.</p>
<p>Qurrok likes physical challenges. He neither shies away from combat nor backs down from a fight unless his mother, Speleosa, commands him to.</p>

Maddgoth&rsquo;s claim to the castle has so far gone unchallenged by Halaster, and it&rsquo;s not clear whether the two wizards have ever crossed paths.</p>
<p>Characters who approach the castle can examine it for points of entry. The main entrance is a door at the base of the south tower (<strong>area area 17</strong>). The castle also features an open courtyard (<strong>area area 23</strong>) with doors leading to areas on the first level. The faerie dragon&rsquo;s preferred route is through a secret trapdoor on the roof (<strong>area area 47</strong>). In addition, the corner towers have arrow slits that Small characters can squeeze through, and the central structure has windows fitted with crystal bars as strong as steel that are spaced 6 inches apart.</p>
<p>Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle is now controlled by Otto the faerie dragon, whose right to ownership is predicated on the argument &ldquo;I found it and it&rsquo;s mine and you can&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo; The castle is a beautiful structure. Its walls, floors, and 20-foot-high ceilings of smooth gray stone can&rsquo;t be damaged or magically altered except with <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spells. The interior walls have colored glass blocks embedded in them. The blocks are not lit when the characters first arrive, but pulling a lever in <strong>area area 37</strong> causes each block to shed colorful light as bright as that created by a <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spell. Maddgoth&rsquo;s magic keeps the temperature inside the castle steady at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but characters can shut off the heat by pulling another lever in <strong>area area 37</strong>.</p>
<p>Exterior doors are made of stone with adamantine hinges, and, like the castle walls, are impervious to damage. Interior doors look like fancy stained glass windows with iron hinges on one side. Each one is fitted with panes of colored glass set in an iron framework. The door handles are likewise fashioned from iron. A locked interior door can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. Its lock can also be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Shattering a door&rsquo;s glass panes creates an opening large enough for a creature to fit through.</p>
<p>Characters near the castle and inside it are shrunk to one-twelfth their normal size along with their gear. Almost everything they encounter inside the castle is similarly reduced in size, creating a sense of normalcy. Maddgoth&rsquo;s homunculus and Otto the faerie dragon are noteworthy exceptions; use their modified statistics for encounters in the castle.</p>

The exterior door is not locked, but opening it triggers a permanent <wc-fetch type=spell>alarm</wc-fetch> spell that rings throughout areas <strong>area 18</strong>, <strong>area 28</strong>, and <strong>area 38</strong>.

While awake, the faerie dragon prefers to remain <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and likes to play pranks on guests.</p>
<p>Otto&rsquo;s favorite prank is to sneak up on a guest, engulf it in a cloud of euphoria gas, and sneak away while remaining <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> the whole time. Its second favorite prank is to cast mage hand and use the spectral appendage to tap guests on the shoulder. Any time it performs such a prank, the faerie dragon has a 25 percent chance of betraying its location with a giggle or a snicker. The faerie dragon must then relocate itself on its next turn to keep from being caught.</p>
<p>Casting a spell that requires concentration causes the faerie dragon to become visibleâ€”after which it can move, cast a spell that doesn&rsquo;t require concentration (such as color spray or hallucinatory terrain), and use its bonus action to turn <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> again. Otto is careful about casting spells that require concentration, because it can&rsquo;t concentrate on the spell and stay <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> at the same time. It normally casts mirror image before casting a spell that requires concentration, trusting that its images will protect it while it maintains concentration on the spell. If Otto succeeds in incapacitating a guest, it tries to remove the guest&rsquo;s weapons and gear, then spends the next hour hiding these items throughout the castle.</p>
<p>Otto reserves its polymorph spell for a truly dangerous adversary, turning that enemy into a frog before making a hasty escape.</p>
<p>If the characters get rid of Maddgoth&rsquo;s homunculus, the faerie dragon takes a shine to them and offers to pay them 50 gp for each trinket they deliver to it. Otto collects trinkets and has a secret stash of coins (see <strong>area area 43b</strong>).</p>

Courtyard</h3><p><strong>Statue</strong>. In the center of this open-air courtyard, surrounded by gardens of glittering, pebble-sized crystals, stands a 9-foot-tall statue of a plump human wizard wearing a helmet with blade-like fins and reading from a spellbook. The statue faces southwest, and the pedestal on which it rests is engraved with the word &ldquo;MADDGOTH.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Doors</strong>. Paths radiating from the statue end in front of four magically locked stone doors (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong>. Crystal-barred windows look down on the courtyard from the two floors above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pulling the correct lever in <strong>area area 37</strong> unlocks all the doors leading to the courtyard. A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic can also unlock a door. Each time such a spell is cast in the courtyard, a blade of force like that created by the <wc-fetch type=spell>Mordenkainen&rsquo;s sword</wc-fetch> spell materializes next to the statue. Each sword acts on initiative count 17. On its turn, the sword flies up to 20 feet toward the nearest creature and makes a melee spell attack against it (+8 to hit), dealing <wc-roll>3d10</wc-roll> force damage on a hit. A sword lasts for 1 minute or until successfully dispelled (DC 17), and it can pursue creatures beyond the courtyard&rsquo;s confines.</p>
<p>The statue&rsquo;s eyes betray a hint of madness, and the wizard&rsquo;s helm is a representation of Maddgoth&rsquo;s magic helmet (found in <strong>area area 25b</strong>). Like the castle, the statue can&rsquo;t be damaged or altered in any way. Carved into the pages of its open spellbook is the <wc-fetch type=spell>Mordenkainen&rsquo;s sword</wc-fetch> spell. A wizard can take a rubbing of the spell and copy it into a spellbook.</p>

<p>Maddgoth took the spellbooks from scores of dead wizards and used them to construct the desk and chair for himself. Any character who examines the furniture can quickly ascertain that the spellbooks belonged to many different wizards. Some look much older than others. A coating of thick lacquer gives these furnishings a glass-like sheen and prevents the books from being opened. Characters who smash the desk and chair can salvage twelve intact spellbooks, nine from the wreckage of the desk and three from the wreckage of the chair. The remaining books are too damaged to be salvaged or read.</p>
<p>To determine a particular spellbook&rsquo;s contents, roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll>. The book contains four wizard spells of each level up to and including the number rolled on the die. For example, on a roll of 3, a spellbook contains four spells of each level from 1st through 3rd. Pick spells from the wizard spell list.</p>

A creature can reach into the liquid and remove a helm from inside it. The helm belongs to Maddgoth. Fashioned from mithral, it has blade-like fins. If the mirror is smashed while the helm is inside it, the helm is lost forever.</p>

Northwest Guest Room</h3><p>The door frame has a silver coin wedged into it (see <strong>area area 19</strong>). This room&rsquo;s features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Furnishings</strong>. A bed heaped with pillows, a 4-foot-tall armoire, and an empty sea chest decorate the room. Rugs woven with wave-like patterns cover the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Ship in a Bottle</strong>. Displayed atop the armoire is a large bottle containing a beautiful model of a longship.</p>
<p><strong>Portrait</strong>. Behind the bottle, hanging on the wall, is a large framed portrait of a wild-haired old man (Halaster) gazing down at the boat with a mad gleam in his eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longship model is 54 inches long by 15 inches wide, contained in a corked glass bottle 5 feet long and 1Â½ feet wide. The bottle rests on its side in a wooden stand and is portable. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the ship.</p>
<p>An <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic cast on the model reveals that it&rsquo;s an actual longship magically reduced to one-twelfth its normal size. The spell also reveals that the only way to restore the ship to its actual size (54 feet long by 15 feet wide) is to touch the ship while speaking the proper command phrase: &ldquo;Our voyage is at hand!&rdquo; Once the ship enlarges to normal size, it becomes an ordinary longship (worth 10,000 gp intact) and cannot be shrunk back down. If it is restored to full size in a space too small to contain it, such as this chamber, the ship splinters apart and is destroyed. Creatures nearby might take damage from flying debris at your discretion. The ship is unaffected by the size-altering magic of Maddgoth&rsquo;s castle.</p>

<p>The odor of charcoal becomes stronger as one approaches the bed.

</blockquote>
<p>Maddgoth removed the slaad&rsquo;s control gem and, for fun, ordered the creature to crawl inside the octobass and remain there.</p>
<p>The old man claims to be Zartem, a wizard whom Maddgoth invited to the castle for dinner. He further claims that Maddgoth stole his spellbook and used magic to trap him inside the octobass. If the characters shatter the fragile instrument, the slaad is no longer bound by Maddgoth&rsquo;s parting instructions and attacks its liberators. The slaad prefers to fight with its greatsword (which is hidden from view while it&rsquo;s in the octobass) or catch multiple foes in the area of a <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> spell.</p>

Master Bedchamber</h4><p>Maddgoth slept as little as possible and spent almost no time here. The room&rsquo;s features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Decor</strong>. The wood-paneled walls are decorated with six framed portraits of a fat, smiling wizard clutching a wand. A thick, brown, wall-to-wall carpet covers the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Game</strong>. In the southwest corner, two wooden thrones face an impressive Dragonchess set on a table.</p>
<p><strong>Bed</strong>. A large four-poster bed stands against the west wall between two crystal-barred windows. A hefty figure sleeps under the covers, snoring loudly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The snoring lump under the covers is an illusion. If the covers are pulled back, the snoring stops as it&rsquo;s revealed that there&rsquo;s no one in the bed. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the bed also ends the illusion.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around each framed portrait of Maddgoth. When a creature casts a spell in this room or disturbs the figure in the bed, the six wands depicted in the framed portraits magically spring from their paintings, gaining the statistics of Flying Sword, and remain detached from the paintings thereafter. Replace the wands' Longsword action option with the following:</p>

<p>Most of the apparel on display was taken from wizards whom Maddgoth killed. Consequently, they come in all sizes and fashions. Many of these items have obvious burn marks, tears, bloodstains, and other defects suggesting how their previous owners met their ends.</p>

Secure Records</h4><p>The door to this room is locked and trapped with a <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch> spell. Maddgoth took the key with him, and opening the door by any means other than using the proper key triggers the spell. Picking the lock requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.</p>
<p>An examination of the door accompanied by a successful DC 19 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check detects the nearly <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> glyph, which is scratched into one of the door&rsquo;s stained glass panes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (<wc-roll>10d8</wc-roll>) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The glyph has the secondary effect of blowing out all the glass in the door.</p>

Console</h3><p>The door frame has a platinum coin wedged into it (see <strong>area area 19</strong>). Bolted to the floor in the middle of the room is an iron console that resembles a pedestal with a slanted top. Protruding from the console are three brass levers arranged side by side, with the outer levers in the up position and the middle lever in the down position. To the right of the levers are five brass buttons situated at the points of a gold pentagram. An inscription appears next to each lever and each button.</p>
<p>A creature can use an action to adjust up to three levers and buttons, in any combination. The console serves several functions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Leftmost Lever</strong>. The inscription under this lever reads &ldquo;COURTYARD.&rdquo; Lowering the lever unlocks the four doors that lead into <strong>area area 23</strong>. Raising the lever locks them again.</p>
<p><strong>Middle Lever</strong>. The inscription under this lever reads &ldquo;LIGHT.&rdquo; Raising the lever turns on the castle&rsquo;s interior lights. Lowering the lever turns them off again. (While the interior lights are on, creatures in the surrounding cavern can see the castle.)</p>
<p><strong>Rightmost Lever</strong>. The inscription under this lever reads &ldquo;HEAT.&rdquo; Lowering the lever shuts off the heat, reducing the interior temperature by 10 degrees each hour until it drops to 30 degrees Fahrenheit (the temperature of the surrounding cavern). Raising the lever causes the temperature to rise 10 degrees each hour until it reaches 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p><strong>Button 1</strong>. The inscription next to this button reads &ldquo;MUSIC.&rdquo; Pushing the button fills the castle with ambient orchestral music occasionally punctuated with a singing chorus. Pressing the button again ends the music.</p>
<p><strong>Button 2</strong>. The inscription next to this button reads &ldquo;ROOF.&rdquo; Pushing the button teleports all creatures in the room to the castle rooftop (<strong>area area 43</strong>), along with whatever items they&rsquo;re wearing and carrying.</p>
<p><strong>Button 3</strong>. The inscription under this button reads &ldquo;FOG.&rdquo; Pushing the button fills the castle hallways (areas <strong>area 18</strong>, <strong>area 28</strong>, and <strong>area 38</strong>) and the stairways connecting them with fog, making these areas heavily obscured. The fog lasts for 1 hour or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p>
<p><strong>Button 4</strong>. The inscription next to this button reads &ldquo;LOCKDOWN.&rdquo; Pushing the button causes every door in the castle (including the rooftop trapdoor) to lock, as if sealed by an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell. This effect lasts for 1 hour. While locked in this way, the interior doorsâ€”most of which are as much iron as glassâ€”also become electrified. Such a door deals 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) lightning damage to any creature that touches it.</p>
<p><strong>Button 5</strong>. The inscription next to this button reads &ldquo;DO NOT PRESS!&rdquo; Pushing the button causes bolts of lightning to erupt from the console. Every creature in the room must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (<wc-roll>8d10</wc-roll>) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in metal armor has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>

<p>The floor is made of tiny bits of colored glass and crushed gems, polished to a lustrous sheen. Four Living Unseen Servant (see appendix A), each carrying a mop and a bucket of soapy water, stand outside the doors to areas <strong>area 39</strong> through <strong>area 42</strong>, ready to clean up any spills in the hall. The servants defend themselves with their mops (treat as clubs) if attacked but are otherwise harmless.</p>

<p><strong>Mirror</strong>. Embedded in the middle of the south wall is a rectangular mirror in a stone frame.</p>
<p><strong>Statue</strong>. Standing in front of the mirror is an unfinished 8-foot-tall statue of a merfolk blowing a conch shell, its lower body replaced by a misshapen block of chiseled granite. (This statue is a shapechanged roper.)</p>
<p><strong>Tridents</strong>. Four tridents hang on the north and east walls between the arrow slits. They fly off the walls and attack if certain conditions are met.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tridents animate and attack if any of them are disturbed or if the roper dies. They have the statistics of Flying Sword but deal piercing damage instead of slashing damage on a hit.</p>

<ul>
<li>If a creature speaks the words &ldquo;Way out!&rdquo; while pointing at the mirror, the gate opens for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Characters must be 11th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jhesiyra Kestellharp</strong>"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see &ldquo;<strong>area Elder Runes</strong>").</li>

<p>The roper has the following additional trait:</p>

Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn&rsquo;t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
<p>The roper answers to the name Miguel. It has instructions to attack any creature that enters the room through the mirror gate. It also attacks any creature that threatens to do it harm. Halaster feeds the roper regularly so that it doesn&rsquo;t have to attack out of hunger. Neither Otto the faerie dragon nor Maddgoth&rsquo;s homunculus is aware that the statue is really a creature in disguise.</p>

Hanging on the handle of each door to this room is a crude wood-and-rope sign bearing the chalk words &ldquo;HOMUNCULI UNWELCOME&rdquo; in Draconic. The western door is closed and has a gold coin wedged in its frame (see <strong>area area 19</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The eastern door is ajar. A gold coin lies on the floor just inside the room, which contains the following:</p>
<p><strong>Homunculus</strong>. Unless it has been encountered and detained elsewhere, Maddgoth&rsquo;s oversized homunculus is flipping tables, knocking over bookshelves, throwing chairs, kicking chests, and tearing rugs into strips with its teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Junk</strong>. Stuff that the faerie dragon has accumulated litters the floor, as well as many items that are broken beyond repair.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Door</strong>. A secret door in the north corner of the east wall opens into <strong>area area 43b</strong>. (The homunculus is unaware of it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maddgoth&rsquo;s homunculus knows it can&rsquo;t be killed and attacks the characters unless they withdraw immediately. If it is destroyed, it melts away and re-forms in <strong>area area 25a</strong>.</p>
<p>Otto&rsquo;s spoils include candles and candle snuffers, potted mushrooms, mortars and pestles, lamps, belts, pentacle pendants, recipe books, sticks of colored chalk, kettles, cauldrons, spoons, stuffed animals, spools of wire, glass beads, wigs, walking sticks, bars of soap, balls of yarn, cracked mirrors and prisms, quills, smoking pipes, empty scroll tubes, and torn sheaves of parchment. Though some of the collection&rsquo;s pieces might be useful and many are colorful or whimsical in design, nothing here holds any special value.</p>

Otto&rsquo;s Secret Stash</h4><p>Otto&rsquo;s most prized possessions fill this cluttered space. These treasures are spread across tables that have been stacked atop one another, forming makeshift shelves that scrape the 20-foot-high ceiling and threaten to topple at any moment. Any character who tries to get at a hard-to-reach item has a 50 percent chance of setting into motion a Rube Goldberg-esque cascade of tables and baubles. When everything comes tumbling down, every creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

Wizard&rsquo;s Armory</h3><p>This room is locked, its key lost. Otto punched a hole through one of the door&rsquo;s glass panes to get a look inside but didn&rsquo;t see anything of interest. Characters who peer inside see the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bats</strong>. Two ordinary Bat flap around the room. Each bat transforms into a nycaloth if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if the door to the room is opened.</p>
<p><strong>Scroll</strong>. On the north wall, east of the door, hangs a framed scroll pressed flat behind a sheet of glass. Bolted to the wooden frame is a tiny metal plaque that reads, &ldquo;Break glass in case of emergency.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maddgoth&rsquo;s idea of an armory is a pair of well-paid nycaloths named Yzig and Gorzog. They can&rsquo;t leave the room until they&rsquo;re restored to their true form, and they won&rsquo;t leave the castle before Maddgoth returns. Their orders are to slay castle invaders. The nycaloths recognize Maddgoth&rsquo;s homunculus and won&rsquo;t harm it; all other creatures are attacked on sight.</p>
<p>Without its master around, the homunculus doesn&rsquo;t trust the nycaloths and thus hasn&rsquo;t tried to free them.</p>

If Otto is not present, the door is closed and has a silver coin lodged in its frame (see <strong>area area 19</strong>). The room&rsquo;s features are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tables</strong>. Tables stand haphazardly about the room, their surfaces cluttered with alchemical equipment.</p>

Roof and Battlements</h3><p>The roof offers little in the way of a view, since the surrounding cavern is all but lost in darkness. The echoes that a single shout can create are astonishing, though. Four-foot-high crenellated battlements enclose the roof.</p>

<a href=#hidden-trapdoor class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Hidden Trapdoor</h4><p>An 8-foot-square trapdoor near the northern battlement hides a stone staircase that leads down to <strong>area area 38</strong>. This is the route by which Otto the faerie dragon comes and goes from the castle.</p>
<p>The trapdoor blends in with the surrounding stonework, and detecting it requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Tiny letters scratched into the trapdoor spell the words &ldquo;KNOCK KNOCK&rdquo; in Draconic.</p>
<p>Knocking twice on the trapdoor causes it to swing open on its own, then close 1 minute later. Otherwise, the trapdoor must be pried open with a crowbar or similar tool. Prying the trapdoor open requires a successful DC 18 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

Killing all the giants saddens Otto the faerie dragon, but its goals don&rsquo;t change. If the characters help the giants by dealing with the faerie dragon, all is forgotten in a few hours when the giants' memories fade away.</p>
<p>If the slaad in <strong>area area 33</strong> succeeds in slaying or driving off the characters, it makes its home in the castle, hoping that Maddgoth will one day return with the slaad&rsquo;s control gem. In a struggle between the faerie dragon and the slaad for control of the castle, the slaad can win either by killing Otto or forcing the dragon into hiding.</p>
<p>Characters who leave the level and later return discover that the giants don&rsquo;t recognize them or remember having met them previously. If one or more giants were killed, the surviving ones retain no memory of how their fallen kin died. If all the giants die, Halaster might freeze the caverns and fill them with a tribe of yetis led by a mated pair of abominable yetis, or provide the space to a clan of degenerate fomorians.</p>
<p>After the characters depart, Maddgoth might return to check on things. He&rsquo;s either a neutral evil archmage who has exceeded his natural life span with <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Longevity</wc-fetch>, or he&rsquo;s a lich. Choose whichever form you prefer. In either case, Maddgoth tries to put his house in order, which could take weeks if the characters made a mess of things. Maddgoth might be accompanied by a mage he has invited to stay with him on some false pretense. In truth, Maddgoth plans to torture and murder his house guest, as he has done with so many others.</p>
<p>Maddgoth wears a <wc-fetch type=item>horned ring</wc-fetch> (a very rare magic item) that allows a wearer attuned to it to ignore Undermountain&rsquo;s magical restrictions (see &ldquo;<strong>area Alterations to Magic</strong>"). He also carries the control gem for the slaad in <strong>area area 33</strong>. If the party didn&rsquo;t claim his helm (see <strong>area area 25b</strong>), he dons it for the duration of his stay in the castle. If the nycaloths are still around (see <strong>area area 44</strong>), Maddgoth retains their services as bodyguards. If the characters prove too great a challenge for him, Maddgoth teleports away and returns the next day with eight Mezzoloth to help him clean house.</p>
