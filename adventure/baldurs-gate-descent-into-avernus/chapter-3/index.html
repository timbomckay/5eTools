<p><em>The purest of souls lures fiends into a hellish trap. Zap! Zap</em>!</p>
<p>—The Cartographer</p>
<p>When the characters approach this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Radiant light cascades from a rusted metal monument shaped like the upraised mandibles of a giant beetle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The light cascades from a unicorn named Mooncolor, who is trapped inside a 10-foot-diameter sphere of magical force that prevents any matter from passing into it and blocks any spells cast into or out of it. The sphere is suspended between the zapper&rsquo;s spines, 50 feet above the ground. This light lures demons like moths to a flame, annihilating them when they get close. While trapped in the sphere, the unicorn can&rsquo;t use any of its magical abilities.</p>
<p>The sphere targets the nearest fiend that moves within 100 feet of it, discharging a beam of radiance that forms a line 5 feet wide and up to 100 feet long, extending to the target. Any creature in the line that has 100 hit points or fewer disintegrates into a pile of ash. Creatures with more than 100 hit points in the line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 260 (<wc-roll>40d12</wc-roll>) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the demon zapper has fired, it must recharge for 1 minute before it can fire again.</p>
<p>To free the unicorn, the characters must destroy the rusted metal structure around it, which has AC 14, 250 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The structure crumbles when it drops to 0 hit points, causing the sphere of force to slowly sink to the ground and fade away. If the characters free the unicorn, it accompanies them if they are of mostly good alignment.</p>

Ralzala swore loyalty to Zariel to gain revenge against a rival dao who tried to ruin her. The dao regrets the arrangement and wants to break her pact with the archdevil.</p>
<p>Ralzala hides under the ground at the base of the zapper. If the characters damage the zapper, Ralzala emerges from the ground, casts <wc-fetch type=spell>tongues</wc-fetch>, and offers them a deal. She reveals that the deposed archdevil Bel would gladly aid the characters in overthrowing Archduke Zariel of Avernus. If the characters help Ralzala break her pact with Zariel, the dao promises to direct them to Bel&rsquo;s Forge and write them a letter of introduction.</p>
<p>Ralzala knows an oracle named Red Ruth, who could surely divine a solution to her problem. Being bound to the demon zapper, Ralzala is unable to seek out this oracle herself, but the characters could do so in her stead. She tells them to speak with Red Ruth in the corrupted forest nearby and follow her instructions to break the pact. This leads the players to the <strong>area Bone Brambles</strong>.</p>

She&rsquo;ll open your veins to paint the story hidden in your heart</em>.</p>
<p>—The Cartographer</p>
<p>When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A maze of warped trees and bonelike vines stretches before you. Calcified corpses merge with the trees, covered in fungal pods that feed on the blood oozing through the undergrowth. Here and there, narrow paths wend deeper into the wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a bygone age, the night hag Red Ruth corrupted a community of dryads by fouling the roots of their trees with mind-bending poison. As the dryads fell to evil, their forest was wrenched from the Feywild into Avernus. Those dryads who resisted the poison died trying to merge back into their trees. The rest crumbled to ash and became restless, tortured spirits akin to banshees. Contented, Red Ruth made her home at the heart of the twisted wood.</p>
<p>The characters can venture into the wood out of curiosity or to find the oracle that Ralzala hopes can break her pact with Zariel.</p>

Entrances</h4><p>Characters who circle the tangled stretch of woodland uncover five separate paths leading into its interior. Impassable brambles choke the woodland outside these trails and even grow overhead to blot out the sky.</p>
<p>To avoid getting lost in the wood, the characters must succeed on a DC 15 group Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check. On a success, the characters locate Red Ruth&rsquo;s lair at the heart of the woodland (<strong>area area B3</strong>). If they fail, they blunder into one of the dead ends listed below (area B2) and must make the check again when they move on. Once all four dead ends have been explored, the group automatically locates Red Ruth&rsquo;s lair.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A cave-like hovel lies at the center of the maze. Hundreds of bones and body parts hang by twine from the entrance, and the ceiling is strung with garland made of bloody entrails. The air buzzes with flies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Red Ruth, a night hag, makes her lair inside this gory den. She wears a dress made from stitched-together bones. Strings of infants' skulls hang around her neck and chatter nursery rhymes incessantly (and in different languages) as she talks.</p>
<p>Evil visitors from all over the multiverse travel to Avernus to hear Red Ruth&rsquo;s divinations and sample her mystical brews. If the characters talk to Red Ruth about the dao&rsquo;s curse, she offers them a deal for her assistance (see &ldquo;<strong>area Hold the Fort</strong>&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>Red Ruth sells potions brewed from blood, which she gladly trades for <wc-fetch type=item>Soul Coin</wc-fetch> as listed on the Red Ruth&rsquo;s Bargains table. Each potion imparts an unpleasant but harmless side effect when imbibed: flatulence, boils, hair loss, or any other ghastliness you can conceive. Her divinations replicate the effects of a <wc-fetch type=spell>commune</wc-fetch> spell, although Red Ruth provides the answers to the questions without needing to appeal to a divine being.</p>

The hag explains that she&rsquo;s long overdue for her bath—it&rsquo;s been a couple of centuries at the very least since she last washed. She asks the characters to arrange and pay for a pampering session at Infernal Rapture in the <strong>area Wandering Emporium</strong>. She warns the characters of one other condition before they decide: they must watch over her grove while she&rsquo;s gone. If the characters attack or threaten Red Ruth during this negotiation, she simply slips away into the Ethereal Plane and doesn&rsquo;t return until they leave.</p>
<p>The night hag can divine the location of the Wandering Emporium by spilling some of her own blood on the ground and studying the pattern that the blood makes. Red Ruth can then point to a location on the character&rsquo;s map of Avernus. (The location can be anywhere you choose.) When the characters arrive at that location, they encounter the Wandering Emporium just as the night hag predicted. Although Red Ruth knows that the owner of Infernal Rapture is a rakshasa, she doesn&rsquo;t share this information with the characters, expecting them to figure it out on their own.</p>
<p>Characters who return from the Wandering Emporium with confirmation of Red Ruth&rsquo;s appointment must watch over the grove for a few hours while the hag leaves to take her bath. During this time, the cursed spirits of the dryads arise to destroy Red Ruth&rsquo;s lair as punishment for her crimes. This force consists of two dryad spirits (use the banshee stat block) and a walking, undead tree (use the treant stat block, except the tree is undead and has resistance to necrotic damage).</p>
<p>If the characters defeat the undead, Red Ruth fulfills her end of the bargain when she returns. Otherwise, the undead tree collapses the entrance to Red Ruth&rsquo;s hovel. The night hag is not pleased and uses her Etherealness trait to walk through the collapsed entrance of her cave, disappearing into her lair without so much as a goodbye.</p>

<p>The empyrean Uldrak quested into the Nine Hells to slay Tiamat and win glory for his deity, Surtur, but he was beaten handily by the dragon queen. The empyrean wasn&rsquo;t slain; instead, Tiamat cursed him for his impudence by transforming him into a spined devil. This wretched creature now hides inside the helmet that he once wore. For millennia, Uldrak has dwelled in this spot, forlornly plotting to restore his true form.</p>

Now, he&rsquo;s more interested in scrabbling to survive than trying to escape the Nine Hells.</p>
<p>Uldrak&rsquo;s empyrean heritage still lingers in his voice. He understands all languages, and when he speaks, he randomly switches language to Giant. Millennia of isolation have unhinged his mind, so he argues with himself often, even in front of strangers.</p>
<p>Uldrak reveals his sorry tale to any who ask him about the empyrean&rsquo;s whereabouts. Characters who came here to extract Uldrak&rsquo;s blood (see &ldquo;<strong>area Bone Brambles</strong>,&rdquo; above) can make a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check when they learn that Uldrak is now a fiend.

<p>When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A dark tower looms on the horizon, its black spire rising hundreds of feet, its ramparts bristling with charred skulls mounted on iron spikes. The tower&rsquo;s apex splits into five narrower spires that jab at the sky like clawed fingers. Circling above the tower&rsquo;s peak is a great white dragon stained with ash and soot.</p>
<p>As you get closer to the tower, you notice figures shuffling atop its ramparts—undead guards in various states of decay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arkhan the Cruel has claimed this tower as his base. Here, with the help of a tortle death-priest of Tiamat named Krull, the dragonborn warrior researches ways to assert his will over the artifact known as the <wc-fetch type=item>Hand of Vecna</wc-fetch>, so he can use its secrets to free the evil dragon queen Tiamat from the Nine Hells. Arkhan has traveled to a nearby monument to commune with his goddess, leaving Krull behind.</p>
<p>Dragons tore the obsidian rocks of Arkhan&rsquo;s tower from the fiery volcanoes of Avernus. Fifty Skeleton and thirty Zombie stand ready to defend the tower, which is also guarded by the adult white dragon Obatala. When it detects intruders, the dragon roars to alert Krull, who emerges from the tower to greet new arrivals. Krull, whose shell is carved with Draconic runes that spell out prayers to Tiamat, is joined by four Ghoul that serve as his assistants. The ghouls gnaw on bones and eye the characters hungrily as Krull negotiates with them. Under no circumstances does Krull allow intruders to enter the nine-story tower and disturb his experiments or Arkhan&rsquo;s chambers.</p>
<p>Krull is willing to lead the characters to Arkhan if they have something valuable in their possession, such as the <wc-fetch type=item>orb of dragonkind</wc-fetch> recovered from Uldrak&rsquo;s Grave or the unicorn rescued from the <strong>area demon zapper</strong>. Otherwise, the tortle instructs the characters to leave at once or die.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A colossal dragon&rsquo;s skull leans against a mountainside, surrounded by bones the size of houses. Acrid smoke rises from the skull&rsquo;s maw. A military tent has been pitched among the bones, and parked next to it is a two-wheeled infernal war machine.</p>
<p>Gathered around this tent are a dozen chattering, reptilian humanoids with gleaming swords, white scales, and white, leathery wings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tunnel at the back of the skull leads to Tiamat&rsquo;s lair. The devils nesting within the skull, the abishai, are believed to carry out her bidding—or perhaps guard over her prison on orders of Asmodeus.</p>
<p>From the depths of her lair, Tiamat can hear the prayers and pronouncements of faithful servants who call out to her from the maw of the colossal dragon skull. If the dragon queen chooses to reply, her five hissing voices issue from the darkness, amplified by the skull as they give commands and finish each other&rsquo;s sentences.</p>
<p>It would be madness to assault this location without an army. Abishai of all colors nest in the sulfurous caves behind the skull, and scores of white abishai pour forth to counter any assault or invasion.</p>
<p>The infernal war machine parked next to the tent is a Devil&rsquo;s Ride belonging to Arkhan the Cruel&rsquo;s minotaur bodyguard, Torogar Steelfist.</p>

Arkhan visits the monument to commune with his queen and report on his ongoing battle of wills to master the <wc-fetch type=item>Hand of Vecna</wc-fetch>, which came into his possession during a brief excursion to the world of Exandria.</p>
<p>If the characters approach Arkhan&rsquo;s encampment, the twelve white abishai at the camp rush forward to intercept them. Characters accompanied by Krull the tortle (see &ldquo;<strong>area Arkhan&rsquo;s Tower</strong>") or who have something Arkhan might consider valuable are permitted to approach his camp.</p>
<p>Arkhan believes he can use the <wc-fetch type=item>Hand of Vecna</wc-fetch> to unlock the means of freeing Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells, but only if the hand doesn&rsquo;t kill him first. The hand is slowly corrupting Arkhan&rsquo;s flesh and decomposing his body on one side. To stave off this decline, Arkhan needs to use the <wc-fetch type=item>Hand of Vecna</wc-fetch> to snuff the life out of good-aligned creatures. If the characters try to cut a deal with Arkhan—for a vial of Tiamat&rsquo;s blood or help contacting the dragon queen herself—Arkhan demands the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature in exchange. Lulu is an ideal candidate, as is the unicorn Mooncolor (see &ldquo;<strong>area Demon Zapper</strong>"). Sacrificing such a creature to Arkhan is an evil act.</p>
<p>In battle, Arkhan uses <wc-fetch type=spell>branding smite</wc-fetch> to channel the radiant power of Tiamat into his weapon attacks. If a fight turns against him, he uses the <wc-fetch type=spell>teleport</wc-fetch> power of the <wc-fetch type=item>Hand of Vecna</wc-fetch> to return to his tower with as many allies as possible. Should one or more of his comrades fall in battle, Arkhan uses <wc-fetch type=spell>revivify</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>raise dead</wc-fetch> spells to bring them back to life as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If Arkhan finds himself overwhelmed with opposition, he orders the abishai to attack. Arkhan can also use a bonus action to call forth Asojano, a chimera lairing in the depths of the colossal dragon skull. This evil monster in the service of Tiamat considers Arkhan a friend and ally.</p>

After gulping down the empyrean&rsquo;s blood to free herself from her pact, she etches her letter of introduction to Bel onto a basalt tablet and directs the characters to his volcanic lair. The adventure continues in Bel&rsquo;s Forge.</p>

<p>—The Cartographer</p>
<p>When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A gargantuan volcano dominates the horizon. Clouds of fire and ash spew from its caldera, and the air trembles with its angry grumblings. A vast, multilayered fortress has been hewn into the volcano&rsquo;s rocky slopes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bel, one of the Nine Hells' greatest military minds, dwells in this iron keep. From this bastion, Zariel&rsquo;s second-in-command and the former lord of Avernus oversees the forges that furnish weapons and armor for the Blood War.</p>
<p>An army of devils guards Bel&rsquo;s fortress, and his dark magic alerts him to intruders within its walls. Strangers who venture too close are assaulted by a strike team of two Horned Devil leading ten Bearded Devil. If the intruders survive and linger in the area, a whole army of devils descends upon them.</p>
<p>Characters can gain an audience with Bel if they have a letter of introduction (available from the dao Ralzala), or if they&rsquo;re captured or killed by Bel&rsquo;s forces. Bel delights in raising his enemies from the dead to interrogate them, especially if they appear to be outlanders. Infiltrating Bel&rsquo;s fortress is possible, but only if the characters have magical means of shielding themselves from his divinations. If they befriend Olanthius (see &ldquo;<strong>area Crypt of the Hellriders</strong>"), cut a new deal with Red Ruth (see &ldquo;<strong>area Bone Brambles</strong>"), or perform a quest for Mephistopheles (see &ldquo;<strong>area Mirror of Mephistar</strong>"), they could feasibly infiltrate Bel&rsquo;s fortress by smuggling themselves in with any tribute their ally brings before Bel. Whether the characters smuggle themselves inside, arrive with a letter of introduction, or get taken into custody, they eventually arrive at the lowest level of Bel&rsquo;s fortress, where Bel lairs.</p>

Other features of the forge are summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>Heat</strong>. Bel&rsquo;s forge is unbearably hot, with an ambient temperature of 130 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. The extreme heat has detrimental effects on creatures not acclimated to such environments (see &ldquo;Extreme Heat&rdquo; in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide).</p>
<p><strong>Lava</strong>. Open rivers of lava are channeled through the forge to smelt ore and soften metal. Any creature that enters the lava for the first time on its turn or starts its turn in it takes 33 (<wc-roll>6d10</wc-roll>) fire damage. Increase the damage to 99 (<wc-roll>18d10</wc-roll>) fire damage if the creature is fully immersed in the lava.</p>

Though Asmodeus has instructed Zariel to accept Bel as her advisor, Bel and Zariel loathe each other and invent distractions to keep them apart. When Bel learns of the characters' intentions, he decides to use them as pawns to tarnish and ultimately overthrow Zariel.</p>
<p>Bel outwardly plays the role of Zariel&rsquo;s loyal vassal. Secretly, he uses telepathy to hatch a treasonous plot with the characters. Bel&rsquo;s plan is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bel wants the characters to retrieve nine adamantine rods that were stolen from his forge by Zariel&rsquo;s spies. Once all nine rods are returned to him, Bel is willing to divulge the location of the Bleeding Citadel.</li>
<li>Bel suggests that the characters speak to a sibriex that was recently captured by his spies. Sibriexes are hoarders of forbidden lore, and this particular one has been a good source of information for Bel. It might know where Zariel&rsquo;s spies hid the adamantine rods.</li>
<li>To help the characters reach the sibriex, Bel offers to provide them with a barge they can use to ply the River Styx.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bel doesn&rsquo;t tell the characters that the Companion (what he calls the Solar Insidiator) was built in his forge, nor does he reveal that it has a planetar trapped inside it. Bel also fails to mention that the nine adamantine rods are the keys to unlocking the device and freeing the planetar. If the characters ask what the rods are for, Bel says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not really any of your business. This is the best deal you&rsquo;ll get in Avernus. I suggest you take it.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>If the characters become belligerent or demanding, Bel sighs and snaps his fingers, causing the infernal chains to fall off the fire giants. He promises freedom to any fire giant that kills an intruder, prompting the giants to attack the characters without mercy. Bel then steeples his fingers and watches the battle unfold. In battle, the fire giants hurl buckets, tools, and heavy chains instead of boulders. They also try to shove enemies into channels of molten lava.</p>
<p>If the characters defeat the fire giants, Bel commends their victory and offers them the same deal as before. If the characters refuse him a second time, Bel smiles and says, &ldquo;A pity. All those poor people in Elturel were counting on you.&rdquo; He then offers to teleport them out of his fortress, so they can be on their way. Gracious host that Bel is, he won&rsquo;t attack the characters directly unless they attack him first, in which case he casts <wc-fetch type=spell>imprisonment</wc-fetch> on a party member (Lulu being his first choice). If the spell works, Bel vows to release his prisoner once the nine adamantine rods are found and returned to him, no questions asked.</p>

If the characters agreed to Bel&rsquo;s terms, an imp named Balakros is waiting for them when they return to the surface. Bel instructs the imp to help the characters reach the sibriex. The imp has performed this task before and knows, without having to be told, that its orders include reporting back to Bel and whispering everything the sibriex said into its master&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>If characters refuse to let Balakros accompany them, the imp bids them farewell, turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>, and follows them at a respectful distance.</p>

An iron road leads from Bel&rsquo;s volcano to the barge, and it&rsquo;s patrolled by Bearded Devil that won&rsquo;t attack the characters as long as Balakros is leading them. Lashed to the sides of the barge are demon skulls and bones. Characters who travel by barge must pass underneath the <strong>area Stygian Dock</strong> on their way to the sibriex.</p>
<p>The barge is 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, and sturdy enough to transport up to two Huge infernal war machines. Twelve Merregon under the command of a bone devil named Krinjak operate the barge&rsquo;s oars. Krinjak&rsquo;s instructions are to take the characters where they need to go. Although it professes loyalty to Bel, Krinjak is secretly a spy for Zariel.

<p>—The Cartographer</p>
<p>When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spiky chains lash a fifteen-foot-diameter, floating blob of quivering flesh to a 20-foot-tall wrought-iron scaffold. Two fiends wrapped in chains stand atop the scaffold, torturing the bloated creature&rsquo;s flesh by tightening its chains. Demon ichor oozes from its wounds, forming a shallow pool around the scaffolding.</p>
<p>A third, jackal-headed fiend uses a bronze horn to yell loudly at the bloated prisoner in multiple languages. It sits cross-legged about half-way up the scaffolding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bel&rsquo;s fiends captured a sibriex and have been torturing and interrogating it for quite a long time now. The sibriex is <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> by infernal chains from Bel&rsquo;s forge that also prevent it from using its spells or actions to escape.</p>

</p>
<p>The demon ichor that pools around the scaffolding smells terrible but can be easily avoided. For more information on demon ichor, see &ldquo;<strong>area Demon Ichor</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Two Chain Devil named Shalok and Jank are torturing the sibriex under the guidance of Fetchtatter, a cruel arcanaloth who signed an infernal contract with Bel, guaranteeing the arcanaloth&rsquo;s loyalty to Bel in exchange for magic items and spellbooks. All three fiends are immune to the sibriex&rsquo;s Warp Creature power.</p>
<p>Fetchtatter uses its speaking horn to address the sibriex, treating it like an idiot child. The arcanaloth&rsquo;s declarations typically begin with, &ldquo;Tell me everything you know about&mldr;&rdquo; and end with a long pause as it waits for the sibriex to answer. The sibriex has grown increasingly obstinate, much to Fetchtatter&rsquo;s chagrin.

At your discretion, the sibriex could have knowledge of other locations shown on the characters' map of Avernus. It gives up what it knows only if the characters use magical methods of interrogation. It doesn&rsquo;t know anything that can help the characters find the <wc-fetch type=item>Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch>, but it knows where Bel&rsquo;s nine adamantine rods are located.</p>
<p>The sibriex uses its telepathy to contact the first party member who comes within 120 feet of it, offering information in exchange for its freedom. The character with whom the sibriex is speaking telepathically can detect the insincerity of the sibriex&rsquo;s offer with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check. Contrary to its claim, the sibriex doesn&rsquo;t plan to help the characters.</p>

If asked about the adamantine rods, the sibriex claims to have seen all nine rods in the wreck of a crashed flying fortress.

<p>—The Cartographer</p>
<p>To reach the wrecked flying fortress, characters must cross a hot, windswept plain wracked by magical fire storms. Flying characters and fast-moving infernal war machines can easily avoid these fire storms.</p>
<p>Characters traveling on foot must succeed on a DC 20 group Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check as they cross the fireswept plain. On a failed check, a fire storm filling a 60-foot cube sweeps across the ground and engulfs as many party members as it can. The storm then attaches itself to one randomly determined party member, staying centered on that creature for 1 minute. At the end of the duration, the storm detaches from that creature and moves off in a random direction. The storm must remain in contact with the ground at all times. If it becomes separated from the creature to which it has attached itself, the storm moves off in a random direction and ceases to endanger the party.</p>
<p>Any character that enters a fire storm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (<wc-roll>8d10</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire storm ignites flammable objects that aren&rsquo;t being worn or held. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 18) cast on the storm causes it to flame out and disappear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A towering wreck rises from the scorched hellscape. It looks like a giant sword blade, tilted to a twenty-degree angle and partly buried underground. Much of its exposed hull is rusted and torn asunder. Hot wind screams as it tears through the hollow structure, and six giant vultures circle high above it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After demons crippled this fortress in battle, Zariel abandoned it and left it to rust. The fortress is 150 feet tall, but the lower third of it is buried underground. All the lower decks have been picked clean, but the command deck at the top still holds promise. Characters can scale the wreck&rsquo;s torn outer hull to reach this deck, which is 80 feet off the ground at its lowest point. Climbing the outside of the wreck without proper gear requires a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. Characters who can fly have no trouble reaching the command deck.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;giant vultures&rdquo; circling above the wreck are six Vrock that attack anyone who gets within 50 feet of the command deck. If three vrocks are killed, the remaining ones flee and don&rsquo;t return.</p>

These slugs scour the wreck for organic matter to feed on, clinging to torn sections of wall, floor, and ceiling while taking shelter from the searing winds and hungry vrocks. Characters who try to make their way up through the interior of the wreck are attacked by five Bone Whelk. Too slow to mount an effective escape, the bone whelks fight to the death.</p>
<p>When a bone whelk dies, it emits a scream that has a 50 percent chance of attracting the vrocks, which attack other creatures (including bone whelks) indiscriminately.</p>

This pipe was designed to siphon tormented souls from the River Styx, feeding them into a 10-foot-diameter cistern below the command deck to power the fortress. The pipe can be accessed by a hatch on every deck except the command deck. Nesting inside the cistern at the top of the pipe is a monster resembling a 30-foot-long centipede that exudes necrotic sludge. If it hears one of the hatches open, it slinks down the pipe to devour any creatures it sees. This creature uses the remorhaz stat block, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever the monster would deal fire damage, it deals necrotic damage instead.</li>

<p><strong>Light Sources</strong>. Areas that are exposed to the outdoors are dimly lit by the hellish red sky of Avernus. Beyond that, the only light sources are harmless showers of sparks that periodically rain down from gashes in the ceiling.</p>

<li>A blaring alarm klaxon</li>
<li>Loud, discordant instrumental music with screaming vocals</li>
<li>A soothing, female-sounding voice saying &ldquo;Aj ta noss iz&rsquo;lech&rsquo;iz ta kraj-ka-nok Asmodei das,&rdquo; which is Infernal for, &ldquo;You are important. Promotion is your destiny. Asmodeus loves you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A deep, devilish voice saying &ldquo;Chy&rsquo;gwa urnossk!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Abandon ship!&rdquo; in Infernal) over and over</li>

Records Room</h4><p>Characters who listen at the iron door to this room hear an inhuman cackling sound beyond. They need <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> or light sources to see into the room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crouched on a pile of humanoid bones in the far, lowest corner of this room is a hunched gnoll that looks underfed. It gnaws on a bone while cackling maniacally to itself. Near its nest is another iron door.</p>
<p>Lying on the floor near you are a pair of glass, bell-shaped horns attached to some loose wires. They look like they were removed from a pair of tall, slender, metal machines standing against the wall opposite you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gnoll is a shapechanged death slaad under the effects of a <wc-fetch type=spell>feeblemind</wc-fetch> spell. While fighting alongside Yeenoghu&rsquo;s demon hordes, the slaad fell into the River Styx, leaving it in a feebleminded state. In five days, it gets a new saving throw to end the effect. Any character who examines the gnoll and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check realizes that some sort of magical effect has reduced it to a witless nincompoop.</p>
<p>While the slaad is feebleminded, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are 1, and it can&rsquo;t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. It&rsquo;s not even self-aware enough to revert to its normal form. It eyes characters suspiciously but doesn&rsquo;t attack them. It has no weapons but can use its action to bite someone on its turn:</p>

Each machine resembles a vertical file cabinet covered with switches and burnt-out lights. A character who spends at least 1 hour taking apart a machine can discern its original purpose with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check:</p>
<ul>
<li>The larger machine was used to transmit messages to other flying fortresses. (Messages were sent by speaking into the machine&rsquo;s glass bell.)</li>
<li>The smaller machine was used to broadcast messages throughout the flying fortress. (One could broadcast a message by speaking into the machine&rsquo;s glass bell.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The larger machine is damaged beyond repair, but a character proficient with tinker&rsquo;s tools can spend 1 hour attempting to repair the smaller machine using parts scavenged from other machines on the command deck, doing so with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. Once the machine&rsquo;s glass bell and a few wires are replaced, the device can be made to function for 24 hours. During this time, characters can use the device to transmit their voices throughout the wrecked fortress.</p>

Adamantine Rods</h4><p>This chamber is at the lowest point of the command deck. Describe the room to the players as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This dark room contains a metal console that has torn free of the wall to your right. Pinned between the console and another wall is a small, desiccated, winged devil that looks like it was crushed to death. In another corner stands a 3-foot block of infernal iron—a locked safe with clawed feet and a three-dial mechanism built into its thick door. Each dial bears numerals written in Infernal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The safe is stuck to the floor with <wc-fetch type=item>sovereign glue</wc-fetch> and can&rsquo;t be moved. It&rsquo;s also airtight, watertight, and impervious to damage and <wc-fetch type=item>thieves' tools</wc-fetch>. To unlock it, the characters need the three-digit combination. When the dials are set to <strong>6 - 6 - 6</strong> (&ldquo;6-6-6&rdquo; in Infernal), the safe door unlocks. Three <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spells are needed to force it open, as the safe has three separate locking mechanisms.</p>
<p>After three unsuccessful attempts to open the safe with the wrong combination, an alarm klaxon sounds throughout the command deck. The alarm is loud enough to startle any vrocks still circling above the wreck, but the alarm attracts no one. The alarm stops after 1 minute.</p>
<p>The safe contains nine adamantine rods, each one weighing 3 pounds and engraved with runes that spell out the words &ldquo;Solar Insidiator Lock&rdquo; in Infernal, followed by a number from 1 to 9. These are the rods that the characters are searching for. Characters familiar with Thavius Kreeg&rsquo;s infernal contract recall that &ldquo;Solar Insidiator&rdquo; is another name for the Companion. Armed with this knowledge, a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check can conclude that the rods were designed to unlock the Companion, suggesting that it might contain something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This room contains two rusty iron crates in one corner and an iron, bell-shaped contraption bolted to the floor in the opposite corner. The bell is nine feet tall and painted black, with several dents and dings in it. Every so often, the bell emits a loud &ldquo;ka-clunk&rdquo; sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each crate contains twenty iron flasks of demon ichor (see &ldquo;<strong>area Demon Ichor</strong>").</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the bell-shaped contraption. Any character who examines the bell and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain its purpose: it kept the fortress aloft and level with the ground. The noise it makes is a rhythmic malfunction caused by the fact that the fortress is leaning to one side.</p>

<p>This chamber contains a stripped-down metal console and several rusty pipes that extend from floor to ceiling. One of the pipes has a two-foot-long gash in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The console&rsquo;s original purpose can&rsquo;t be determined.</p>
<p>Ten Stirge nest in the pipe with the gash in it. If the pipe is jostled or otherwise disturbed, the stirges fly out and attack.</p>

These consoles have keys and function like Infernal typewriters. An imp stationed at each console would type orders from superiors on small slips of paper before delivering them to their intended recipients. Rigged above each desk is a long, slender horn through which bridge officers could dictate their orders.</p>

This warband is led by one of the warlords described in the &ldquo;<strong>area Warlords of the Avernian Wastelands</strong>&rdquo; section. The characters have a few rounds to hide, set an ambush, or return to their vehicles before the enemy warband arrives.</p>
<p>Each warlord has a different reason for visiting the wreck, as outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>Bitter Breath</strong>. The horned devil is thinking about turning the wreck into a base and wants to inspect it.</p>
<p><strong>Feonor</strong>. The archmage heard a rumor that someone has been stockpiling demon ichor inside the wreck, and she plans to steal it.</p>
<p><strong>Princeps Kovik</strong>. Kovik&rsquo;s spies in Bel&rsquo;s Forge have told the chain devil about the adamantine rods. Kovik plans to sell them to Mahadi the Rakshasa (see &ldquo;<strong>area Mahadi, Emporium Master</strong>") for <wc-fetch type=item>Soul Coin</wc-fetch>.</p>

(&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even sign a contract!&rdquo; he laments.) Rather, he hoped they might use the rods to unlock the Companion, thereby freeing the planetar trapped within it and potentially ruining Zariel&rsquo;s plans for Elturel. Bringing the nine rods back to Bel merely implicates him in the plot to free the planetar. After uttering a few choice curse words, he strongly encourages the characters to take the rods to Elturel, stick them in locks along the Companion&rsquo;s equator, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Happy to let the characters keep the rods, Bel makes good on his promise to reveal the location of the Bleeding Citadel. He tells the characters that the <wc-fetch type=item>Sword of Zariel</wc-fetch> is a good-aligned artifact that Avernus itself has long sought to destroy. Bel urges them to find the sword quickly, before the Bleeding Citadel is swallowed up by Avernus and the sword is lost forever. If Lulu is still with the party, she urges the characters to recover the sword before heading back to Elturel.n Grinder. He also carries a <wc-fetch type=item>circlet of blasting</wc-fetch>, which he can don and use to make ranged attacks. The other members of the Goreguts Gang have no treasure.</p>

Mad Maggie and Raggadragga are two warlords whom the characters meet early on. The following sections describe three other warlords who prowl the Avernian wastes: a wingless horned devil named Bitter Breath, a human necromancer named Feonor, and a chain devil named Princeps Kovik. These warlords are as cruel and merciless as the hell they inhabit. All share a &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; mentality.</p>
<p>In Avernus, a warlord&rsquo;s power is measured by the strength and size of its gang, and the threat posed by its infernal war machines. As one warlord bites the dust, another inevitably rises to take its place. Bitter Breath, Feonor, and Princeps Kovik are merely the latest in a long series of warlords to plague the Avernian expanse. If Zariel wasn&rsquo;t so busy fighting the Blood War, she would rid Avernus of these roaming pests; as things stand, she&rsquo;s content to let the warlords wipe each other out instead.</p>
<p>If you need to add some excitement to the adventure, have one of these warlords show up to challenge the characters. One warlord might be after <wc-fetch type=item>Soul Coin</wc-fetch> to fuel its infernal war machines, while another might be eager to forge an alliance with a capable band of adventurers against a greater foe. With the exception of Mad Maggie, these warlords have no lairs, so they can be encountered anywhere at any time.</p>
<p>Avernus has more warlords than the ones described here. You can create new ones, each with their own gangs and infernal war machines. Don&rsquo;t worry about throwing too many infernal war machines at the characters. You can curtail the characters' reliance on infernal war machines by restricting their access to <wc-fetch type=item>Soul Coin</wc-fetch>, which the vehicles burn as fuel. A typical warlord has <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> <wc-fetch type=item>Soul Coin</wc-fetch> and <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> flasks of demon ichor (see &ldquo;<strong>area Demon Ichor</strong>") at any given time.</p>

The rules for infernal war machines in appendix B are meant to help you adjudicate situations that arise during encounters, but combat involving infernal war machines works best with &ldquo;theater of the mind&rdquo;-style play, where it&rsquo;s more important to capture the emotion of a chase than know the exact location and orientation of every vehicle on the battlefield.</p>
<p>If a situation arises that the vehicle rules don&rsquo;t cover, fall back on the core rules. For example, if a character wants to leap from one moving vehicle to another, determine whether the character succeeds or not with a Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check, setting the jump&rsquo;s DC based on the distance between the two vehicles (as well as other factors, as appropriate).

Formerly a pit fiend named L&rsquo;zeth, it strove to undermine Zariel while courting Bel. Shortly after claiming rulership of Avernus, Zariel demoted L&rsquo;zeth to a horned devil.</p>

</p>
<p>For a while, L&rsquo;zeth nursed its damaged pride. Eventually, the despondent devil reignited its ambitions and became involved in a plot to overthrow Zariel. The archdevil&rsquo;s spies learned of the plot. As further punishment, Zariel removed L&rsquo;zeth&rsquo;s wings and cursed the horned devil so that it could no longer enter into deals. Any document that L&rsquo;zeth signs melts away, and any words it utters turn to smoke in its mouth. Thus did L&rsquo;zeth become known as Bitter Breath.</p>

<p>Feonor is a willowy, neutral evil archmage with milky-white eyes and a parasol made of bones and human flesh. Her rivals know her as a powerful necromancer. They suspect that she fled the Material Plane to escape some horrible fate, but the truth is she was invited to Avernus by Mahadi, the rakshasa master of the Wandering Emporium (see &ldquo;<strong>area The Wandering Emporium</strong>"). During a visit to Feonor&rsquo;s world, Mahadi fell head-over-heels in love with her zombie-like indifference. Not long after arriving in Avernus, Feonor grew bored of Mahadi&rsquo;s attempts to impress her. Without so much as a farewell, she took to the Avernian wastes on one of the rakshasa&rsquo;s infernal war machines and never looked back. Years later, Mahadi still refers to her as &ldquo;the one the got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scowl on Feonor&rsquo;s face hints at her constant annoyance with the multiverse around her. She prefers not to speak, and when she does, it&rsquo;s typically only in whispers, her short sentences interspersed and punctuated with frustrated sighs.</p>

<p>This particularly cruel chain devil commanded the Nine Hells' 8th Infantry Legion, &ldquo;Terror Incarnate,&rdquo; which was crushed on the banks of the River Styx by the demon lord Kostchtchie. Blaming its superiors for the defeat, Princeps Kovik gathered the surviving members of its legion and formed the Eighth Remnant, a marauding gang of devils no longer beholden to the infernal hierarchy.</p>
<p>The devils that serve under Kovik do so willingly because the chain devil has earned their trust. Newly disenfranchised devils regularly flock to Kovik&rsquo;s banner.

<p>Each encounter location tied to a path has a recommended character level, as noted in diagram 3.2 or diagram 3.3.

<blockquote>
<p>Wrought iron trees line a trail that leads to the summit of a steep hill. Anguished knights are impaled on the trees' metal branches, their bodies writhing in torment as bloated stirges feast on their blood.</p>

<p>Haruman, a human paladin of Helm, was one of Zariel&rsquo;s most devoted Hellriders. He crucified deserters to Zariel&rsquo;s cause on &ldquo;Coward&rsquo;s Way,&rdquo; a line of tortured souls leading to this desolate hill. Each soul is pinned to a barbed, metal tree. Inscriptions above their heads attest that most of them were mortal knights who abandoned Zariel during her assault into Avernus. Flocks of Stirge buzz between the branches, feasting hungrily on the screaming, crucified victims.

This elf warrior, cursed to an eternity of undeath, tried to redeem his corrupted soul by swearing to hunt down his own kind. Later, he volunteered to join Zariel on her crusade into the Nine Hells. Stirges now swarm back and forth from Jander&rsquo;s body, preserving his existence by injecting him with the blood of his traitorous companions.</p>
<p>Jander pleads for the characters to cut him down so that his soul can move on from this accursed place. He reveals the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jander and Haruman were both part of a host of warriors who joined the angel Zariel in her assault on the Nine Hells.</li>
<li>After charging through the portal into Avernus, Jander panicked and fled back to Elturel. He betrayed his braver comrades by sealing the portal behind them.</li>
<li>Jander and his fellow deserters never revealed their shameful retreat and betrayal of Zariel. It was a badge of shame that the Hellriders, as they were came to be known, would wear in secret until the grave.</li>
<li>After years of anguish, Jander chose to face the sun and throw himself on Lathander&rsquo;s mercy. The prayer fell on deaf ears, and his soul was condemned to the Nine Hells to suffer for his sins.</li>
</ul>
<p>When she beholds Jander impaled on the iron tree, Lulu&rsquo;s memories of him return. She remembers his betrayal of Zariel and gives him a pitiful look. She then admits to the characters that she&rsquo;s made a mistake leading them here and needs to ponder her dreams in more detail to discern the Bleeding Citadel&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>

He begins the encounter 300 feet away and orders the nightmare to close the distance between him and the adventurers as quickly as possible. As Haruman attacks, a hellwasp appears from a nearby nest and tries to grab Lulu and fly off with her (see &ldquo;Development&rdquo; below).</p>

<p><em>Fallen angels are meat for hellwasps. Steer clear, lest you nourish their young with your flesh</em>.</p>
<p>—The Cartographer</p>
<p>Throughout Avernus, aggressive hellwasp colonies shape enormous nests from the cocooned carcasses of slain angels and other fallen celestials. Such structures are magically buoyant and must be tethered by chains to the surface of Avernus. The cocooned angels writhe unpleasantly from the motion of the larvae gorging on their insides, creating the false impression that they still live. Because of this, the mere sight of a hellwasp nest has been known to drive mortals mad. This entry describes a typical nest, such as the one Lulu is carried to from Haruman&rsquo;s Hill.</p>
<p>When the characters encounter their first hellwasp nest, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A gigantic sac of wet, papery material floats high above the surface of hell. Angelic figures with feathery wings stick to its surface like flies in amber, their bodies struggling futilely underneath layers of gunk. Iron chains at the bottom of the structure tether it to the hellish landscape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A typical hellwasp nest contains eight Hellwasp, although twice this number are typically out hunting when the characters arrive. If they paralyze every character in the party with their stings, the hellwasps move them to their larder at the top of the nest (<strong>area area N4</strong>) to be used as food for their larvae.</p>

A hellwasp nest has no stairs, so the characters must fly or use climbing gear to traverse between levels. Each level of the nest is basically one large chamber. Map 3.2 includes a side view of the nest that shows how the various levels stack atop one another.</p>
<p>Map 3.2 shows where dead angels are entombed in the hellwasp nest&rsquo;s translucent walls. The angels' well-preserved corpses, which are visible to creatures inside the nest, keep the nest aloft. Removing them from the walls causes the nest to slowly sink to the ground.</p>

Entry Level</h4><p>The nest&rsquo;s entrance is on its underside, where one or more heavy chains tether the nest 100 feet above the surface of Avernus. The hellwasps keep this level mostly clear to avoid blocking off the hatcheries above. Even so, discarded gear accumulates here among the gory effluvia expelled from the wasps' devoured captives.</p>

Creatures rooting through the junk must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check or alert the wasps. Once the colony is placed on alert, call for initiative rolls. All the hellwasps act on the same initiative count. At the start of each of the hellwasps' turns, one hellwasp arrives from area N2 to defend the nest until all three appear. The rest of the colony remains on high alert for two hours.</p>

<p>Hellwasp larvae are incubating inside the angel carcasses on this level. If a character takes piercing or slashing damage within 15 feet of an angel carcass or moves within 5 feet of one, the carcass explodes and releases <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> hostile hellwasp grub (use the giant centipede stat block to represent them).</p>

Larder</h4><p>The hellwasps gum their victims to the walls of this level using the same regurgitated bile that forms their nest. Two Hellwasp are stationed here at all hours.</p>
<p>If Lulu was abducted and brought to the nest, the characters find her here, stuck to a wall (see &ldquo;Development&rdquo; below). Any creature that ends up gummed to the walls can use an action to try to free itself, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A character can also make this check to pull free a companion within its reach.</p>

Having pondered her dreams further, she says that two sites in Avernus seem important to finding the Citadel: a place where demons manifest (see &ldquo;<strong>area Spawning Trees</strong>"), and another where demons are destroyed (see &ldquo;<strong>area Demon Zapper</strong>"). Lulu has no preference which to investigate first, so she points out both locations on the characters' map and leaves the decision to them. Each of these locations opens a different branch of investigation that leads to the Bleeding Citadel. See diagram 3.2 for an overview of the Path of Demons and diagram 3.3 for an overview of the Path of Devils.</p>
