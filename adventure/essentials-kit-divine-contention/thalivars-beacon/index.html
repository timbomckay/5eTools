Using a device called a planar beacon, Thalivar lured his prey into the tower and trapped them for his experiments. Disaster struck when Thalivar tried using the beacon to acquire a planar artifact called the <wc-fetch type=item>ruinstone</wc-fetch> and accidentally unleashed the contents of his own menagerie. For years, the House of Thalivar stood abandoned, and those who dared to enter it were lost forever.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague wracked Toril, the cursed magic of the beacon was turned outwards on the town, and the monsters lurking within the tower were released. A local adventuring party, the Swords of Leilon, died trying to stop them from spilling out into the town below. Since then, the tower has been haunted by the ghosts of those who died within.</p>
<p>Led by the wizard Gallio Elibro, forces from Neverwinter have recently rebuilt the tower for use as a garrison building. Gallio has repaired the planar beacon and is continuing Thalivar&rsquo;s research into the planes. With the town threatened by invasion, the wizard offers to aid the party by summoning a cadre of bound monsters to defend the walls. Secretly, he has other motives in mind&mldr;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The House of Thalivar is a tall tower at the heart of the town. Recently rebuilt by soldiers, the structure now serves as a garrison for Neverwinter&rsquo;s soldiery. Ravens circle the tower&rsquo;s pointed roof and warm lantern light shines from its windows. At its foot, two arched doorways open into the interior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A company of fifteen Guard inhabit the tower, led by the wizard Gallio Elibro and his guard captain Hazz Yarrum. Two halflings serve the household as cooks and porters. Refer to &ldquo;Meeting Gallio Elibro&rdquo; when the characters present themselves for their quest.</p>

Characters who played the first part of this trilogy, Storm Lord&rsquo;s Wrath, likely saved Gallio when Thalivar&rsquo;s restless spirit possessed him. If Gallio died during that quest, replace him with one of his colleagues from the Order of the Many-Starred Cloak.</p>
<p>Gallio meets the party in the building&rsquo;s entry hall and escorts them to his laboratory on the third floor, where he explains the mission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gallio has recently repaired Thalivar&rsquo;s planar beacon and is using it to trap and bind monsters from beyond this plane of existence.</li>
<li>Once bound, such monsters could serve as useful tools if the town is invaded. However, Gallio needs the characters' help to trap more of them.</li>
<li>Gallio wants the characters to travel with him into the Ethereal Plane and lure the monsters into the spectral light of the planar beacon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gallio can answer any questions the players have about the history of the tower or the mission at hand (see &ldquo;<strong>area Into the Ethereal</strong>").</p>

He intends to use the party to lure the <wc-fetch type=item>Ruinstone</wc-fetch> guardians away, allowing him to seize it for his studies. Gallio doesn&rsquo;t know that the artifact is protected by a field of wild magic. Touching it unleashes a magical backlash that overloads the planar beacon and frees any monsters held inside the tower: the same fate that befell Thalivar.</p>

Its common features are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Ceilings:</strong> Ceilings inside the tower are 20 feet high and vaulted.</p>
<p><strong>Light:</strong> By day, sunlight floods the tower through its many high windows. Areas without natural light are well lit by wall lanterns.</p>
<p><strong>Doors:</strong> Doors are made of wood and kept locked. A locked door can be opened with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A locked door can be opened as an action with a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

Once per day, a creature holding the <wc-fetch type=item>ruinstone</wc-fetch> can use it to undo one action they performed within the past 24 hours, altering reality so that any consequences of that action are erased. For example, a creature could undo the killing blow that they dealt to an enemy, causing that enemy to return to life in the position where it died. Each use of the artifact has a terrible side effect: one random person known to the user is also erased from reality.

<p>Before beginning his ritual, Gallio shows the characters the monsters held in his dimensional cells. He reveals that the planar beacon freezes any extraplanar beings caught in its beam: to bring the monsters home, the characters must grab hold of them, then return to this world and imprison the monster inside one of his dimensional cells.</p>

When the ritual is complete, Gallio asks each character to ring the silver bell mounted on the wall. As they do so, they fade from sight and are transported into the Ethereal Plane. Read the following boxed text aloud when a character first rings the bell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the silver bell is struck, the world fades away. Grey mist swirls into view and the temperature drops to a soul-chilling cold. Your companions and the tower you just stood in remain visible, but appear translucent and oddly distant. In this strange world, a beam of blue light spills from the planar beacon and sweeps around it in a circle, like a spectral lighthouse. Most mysterious of all, a spiral staircase rises from an archway in the wall that wasn&rsquo;t present before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who rings the bell enters the Border Ethereal as though affected by an <wc-fetch type=spell>etherealness</wc-fetch> spell. The effect lasts for 24 hours, during which time a character can pass back and forth between worlds by ringing the silver bell, which exists in both planes simultaneously. When all the characters have passed through, Gallio rings the bell to join them.</p>

As they approach the chamber, Gallio casts a <wc-fetch type=spell>greater invisibility</wc-fetch> spell on himself and instructs the characters to lure the monsters within into the planar beacon. When the characters enter the room, the monsters emerge from the mists to attack them. Any interplanar creature that starts its turn inside the planar beacon room (area B13) is <wc-fetch type=condition>paralyzed</wc-fetch> for one minute. If a character grabs a <wc-fetch type=condition>paralyzed</wc-fetch> monster and then rings the silver bell, they can drag the creature back to the Material Plane and imprison it inside one of the dimensional cells.</p>
<p>While the characters are dealing with the monsters, Gallio tries to unlock the <wc-fetch type=item>ruinstone</wc-fetch> from its pedestal. After 5 rounds, he grabs hold of the stone and tries to remove it by force. Read the following boxed text aloud when this occurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gallio screams from the top of the astral spire. A shockwave washes through the mists, and the spectral light of the planar beacon flickers and dies. Looking back into your own world, you see the trapped monsters awaken and break free from their cells!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Touching the <wc-fetch type=item>ruinstone</wc-fetch> triggers a magical backlash that disables the planar beacon and frees any creatures trapped in its spell. Back on the Material Plane, any captured monsters break free from their cells and rampage through the tower, including the two that Gallio captured previously. To complete their quest, the characters must hunt down and kill the monsters. If they succeed, proceed to &ldquo;Conclusion.&rdquo;</p>

When they approach the body, the ghosts of the Swords of Leilon appear to issue a warning. Read the following boxed text aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pair of ghostly figures emerge from the mists: a dark-skinned warrior woman dressed in chainmail, and a red-bearded dwarf carrying a lute. The woman holds up her hand in a sign of peace and speaks in an echoing voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what happens to those who meddle with the ruinstone. Leave it here, lest the people of Leilon suffer its wrath once more!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ghost can reveal the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>In life, the ghosts belonged to an adventuring company called the Swords of Leilon. The woman was once called Augusta Krul and the dwarf was known as Ogri Ninebeards.</li>
<li>When the wizard Thalivar accidentally released the monsters trapped in his tower, the Swords of Leilon fought and died to hold them back.</li>
<li>Thalivar spent all his life searching for an artifact called the ruinstone. When he finally touched it, its magic broke his planar beacon and released his monsters.</li>
<li>The ghosts have sensed that evil powers have recently learned of the stone and are conspiring to claim it. It must not fall into evil hands!</li>
</ul>
<p>The ghosts urge the characters to help them protect the stone. If a living humanoid willingly binds their soul to the <wc-fetch type=item>ruinstone</wc-fetch>, the artifact will be destroyed when it&rsquo;s next usedâbut doing so erases the soul from existence. Any creature that binds its soul to the artifact suffers no ill effects until the artifact is used, at which point the creature disappears from reality and can only be brought back with a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell, or similar magic. If no characters are willing to volunteer their souls, the ghosts ask them to stay clear of the tower and leave them to guard it.</p>
<p>When Gallio awakens, he admits to his deception and swears never to seek the <wc-fetch type=item>ruinstone</wc-fetch> again. The wizard resigns from his post at once and returns to Neverwinter to face his order.</p>
