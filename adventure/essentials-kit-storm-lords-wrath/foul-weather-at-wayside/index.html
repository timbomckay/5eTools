However, they probably did not learn all of its secrets!</p>
<p>Most of the staff employed at the Wayside Inn are cultists of Talos who follow the dark teachings of Fheralai Stormsworn, a priest of the Stormbringer. Although the inn&rsquo;s owner does not know this, the bartender, Backes Dunfield, is a lieutenant of Stormsworn, fully pledged to the subjugation of the Sword Coast by his master. The rest of the cultists at the Wayside Inn see Backes as their leader however, to be protected and obeyed in any circumstance.</p>
<p>The local cultists have received orders to kidnap a local bard, Tarbin Tul, and then turn the Wayside Inn into a shrine to Talos. From this point, they would establish a series of shrines up and down the High Road, allowing them to bend the weather to their will and choke off travel and trade between the civilized areas of the northern Sword Coast.</p>
<p>As they draw power into the shrine within the Wayside Inn, the cultists summon storms to do the bidding of their master. This results in foul weather and raging skies appearing right above the inn, while the rest of the area is sunny and calm. If the adventurers can intervene in time, they can stop the ritual and save Leilon from destructive weather in their immediate future.</p>

<a href=#the-power-of-the-echo class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Power of the Echo</h4><p>In a D&D adventure, as in any narrative enterprise, repetition is a powerful tool. Images or symbols, when repeated, become a pattern that strengthens a story. Subtle differences in repeated scenes can add to the horror, comedy, or drama of a situation.</p>
<p>In this case, the characters return to the location of the first encounter in this adventure: the Wayside Inn. Some of the descriptions, details, and actions in this encounter are meant to echo that first encounter. If you remember some of the actions that the characters took in that encounter, feel free to add your own echoes.</p>
<p>For example, if the characters danced in the common room during their time at the Wayside Inn previously, the ritual being performed by the cultists could incorporate movement that harkens back to that dance. Although it&rsquo;s a small detail that a typical player might overlook, if even just one of your players gets chills or a laugh because of the echo, it&rsquo;s worth the effort.</p>

To the north, however, in the direction of the Wayside Inn, storm clouds are gathering: very strange storm clouds in the shape of three swirling lightning bolts.</p>
<p>The town council sees this strange phenomenon and becomes concerned. Earlier that morning a group of settlers left to pick up supplies at the inn. The council asks the adventurers to investigate immediately.</p>
<h5 id=a-violent-atmosphere>

The group is soaking wet, and one of the larger carts is being pulled by one horse instead of two.</p>
<p>One of the two soldiers that was accompanying the caravan reports that when the group got within a mile of the inn, the weather became so violent they couldn&rsquo;t continue. The driving rain, fierce winds, and hailstones the size of apples impeded progress to a crawl, and then one of the horses was struck by lightning and killed.</p>
<p>When they retreated just a few hundred yards back down the High Road toward Leilon, the weather was perfectly calm again. The group decided not to risk trying to complete the journey to the inn, but the other soldier sent to guard the caravan agreed to stay and keep an eye on the situation.</p>

(The characters might remember the armor from the Wayside Inn on their previous visit.)</p>
<p>Use the following read-aloud text to set the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wall of storms surges and howls in the distance. The sunny, mild weather gives way immediately to rain and hail, violent winds, and electrical discharges. Passing in and out of the wall are three figures in plate armor, each swinging a flail at a lone figure in splint armor wielding a longsword. The lone fighter, taking on the three in plate, wears the emblem of the Leilon garrison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The soldier, a veteran named Emmalou, is fighting off three Air Elemental Myrmidon (see appendix A). These suits of armor were the same ones crafted by the Wayside Inn&rsquo;s blacksmith, Teega. If the characters don&rsquo;t remember seeing the armor on their previous encounter at the inn, feel free to remind them. Also, if any character stole a suit of the armor and is wearing it now, it falls off the character and animates as another hostile air elemental myrmidon!</p>
<h5 id=curse-of-talos>
<a href=#curse-of-talos class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Curse of Talos</h5><p>If a character is hit with a lightning strike attack from any of the myrmidons, and then fails their saving throw and becomes <wc-fetch type=condition>stunned</wc-fetch>, a mark resembling three parallel lightning bolts appears on their head. It can only be removed by a <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> spell, and its effects are noted later in this quest.</p>
<p>Note that three of these creatures is a deadly encounter, even for 6 characters of 8th level. For fewer characters, or for lower level characters, have the enemies start at half their normal hit points, and allow Emmalou to assist the characters for longer than normal by increasing her hit points.</p>
<h5 id=the-creeping-storm>

The air elemental myrmidons are bolstered by the storm but are weaker when outside it. The edge of the storm expands outward at a rate of 5 feet per round, on initiative count 20.</p>
<p>If the myrmidons are within the storm, their melee attacks are made with advantage. If they can be tempted outside the storm&rsquo;s area, they attack with disadvantage and have disadvantage on saving throws. They move out of the storm only if they have no targets to attack in melee within the storm.</p>

<ul>
<li>The stormy area is slowly growing larger. Emmalou had to retreat several hundred yards to remain outside the zone. She has no idea what is causing it, but such blatant and powerful forces of magic are nothing she wants to be involved with if she has a choice in the matter.</li>
<li>When she was in the stormy area, the lightning was everywhere, but it never struck the suits of armor even though they were made of metal.</li>
<li>She was almost struck a few times, but she kept repeating prayers to Talos, and she thinks that is the only thing that saved her.</li>
<li>She does not want to enter the stormy area and does not do so unless a character convinces her with a successful DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the party travels to the Wayside Inn through the storm, have each character roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll> for the number of times they are struck by lightning as they approach. If a character attempts to pray to Talos and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check, they are not hit by any of the strikes.</p>
<p>For each strike, a character must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) lightning damage, or no damage on a successful save.</p>
<p>Any characters carrying the cursed symbol of Talos from the fight with the myrmidons has disadvantage on those saving throws as well as on the checks to pray to Talos to be spared.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The buffeting winds and violent precipitation grow more intense the closer you get to the inn. Your vision is hampered to the point you can only see clearly within thirty feet.</p>
<p>Lights coming from the inn reveal a strange scene. Six humanoid creatures stand at the main doors, the same doors that the undead creatures were attacking the first time you encountered this place. The figures seem to be pounding on the doors, although they are hampered by the weather.</p>

The cultists have used small tridents to impale six humanoids victims to the doors, leaving them to die as offerings to power their terrible ritual.</p>
<p>Once characters are within 30 feet of the poor souls, they can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check, with disadvantage due to the pouring rain, to realize that these people (Commoner) are staked to the doors by small tridents and trying to pull themselves off. They each only have 1 hit point and are <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>Unless the tridents can be pulled out with a soft touch, requiring a successful DC 15 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Sleight of Hand</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch>) check, the removal does 4 (<wc-roll>1d8</wc-roll>) points of damage, and easily kills the victim.</p>

Also, the doors and windows have an AC of 12 and break with 25 points of damage.</p>
<p>Magical runes, as per the <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch> spell, protect the cloak room and barn doors. If the party opens the doors without first removing or disabling the runes, they take thunder damage as per the spell.</p>
<p>A window at the back of the inn on the second floor is open (see &ldquo;The Upstairs&rdquo; below). A successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check to climb to the window gives characters access to the inn without having to go through the more dangerous front doors.</p>

Spread out between the two areas are Cultist (one per character) with tridents, guarding several bound victims who will be sacrificed at the conclusion of the ritual.</p>
<p>The ritual takes 10 minutes to complete after the characters arrive on the scene. If they do nothing but watch, describe how the chanting from inside gets louder, how the weather gets darker and even more dangerous, and how terrible faces appear in the clouds. If this doesn&rsquo;t urge them to act, the ritual will be completed, and the adventurers must deal with the consequences (see &ldquo;Aftermath&rdquo; below for details).</p>

However, one sneaky individual avoided capture.</p>
<p>In the posh room at the end of the hallway (Room C on the map), a gnome apprentice wizard named Cray Onderquill hides beneath the bed. She was traveling from Neverwinter to Waterdeep on an errand for her master, and she decided to stay the night. When the cultists began grabbing people, she used <wc-fetch type=spell>disguise self</wc-fetch> to imitate a cultist, and then snuck away here to hide. She thought about climbing out the window but is afraid the fall might kill her. She is willing to help the characters in an assault on the cultists, if only by lending her expertise in <wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> to figure out what&rsquo;s happening with the ritual.</p>
<p>Cray also reveals that not all the captives taken by cultists were impaled on the doors: the inn&rsquo;s owner, Martisha Vinetalker, was dragged into the basement, and a local bard, Tarbin Tul, was taken away on horseback. Cray thinks the cultists had strict orders to capture the bard alive, as he heard them talking about being careful with Tul.</p>

When the characters lower themselves through the trap door into the basement, use the following read-aloud text to set the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crates, barrels, and other containers holding food and drink have been pushed aside to make room for a large copper statue at the far side of the room. The statue depicts a four-armed storm god holding lightning bolts in each hand.</p>
<p>Before the statue stands Teega the smith. In the corner behind the statue, Martisha, the inn&rsquo;s owner, is bound with rope. Her face is bruised and bloodied, but she bears no mortal wounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teega (female Illuskan berserker) stands proudly before the statue. The statue of Talos (see appendix A) moves toward the characters, its face twisted in rage.</p>

Until the statue is deactivated, Teega cannot be dropped below 1 hit point.</p>
<p>Describe lightning flowing between the statue and Teega as a clue to this connection. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check, the details of the connection are understood. Also reveal that the corresponding lightning bolt symbols on the statue and Teega&rsquo;s bracers power this connection. As an action, a character within 5 feet of either the statue or Teega can attempt a DC 20 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Sleight of Hand</wc-fetch>) check. On a success, the connection is broken, Teega drops to 0 hit points immediately, and the statue takes <wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll> force damage from the lost connection.</p>

The characters can still defeat the enemies, but they must now deal with the weather. Until they defeat Fheralai Stormsworn, the weather along the Sword Coast grows more and more volatile.
