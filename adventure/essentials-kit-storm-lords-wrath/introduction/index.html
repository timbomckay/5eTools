<p>If the characters played Dragon of Icespire Peak, they have already saved the area around Phandalin from many threats, large and small, and they are likely 7th level, ready for their next challenge. The Sword Coast is a region of the Forgotten Realms teeming with danger and intrigue. Just a short ride west of Phandalin on the Triboar Trail, where it meets the High Road, more nefarious schemes and terrible monsters await.</p>
<p><em>Storm Lord&rsquo;s Wrath</em> is a D&D adventure designed for 7th-level characters. You can run this adventure for as few as one or as many as six players. By the time the characters complete the challenges presented, they will be 9th level and ready to take on the challenges of the next adventures in this series: Sleeping Dragon&rsquo;s Wake and Divine Contention.</p>

The Sword Coast Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide is helpful but not necessary. The Monster Manual contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in appendix A. When a creature&rsquo;s name appears in <strong>bold</strong> type, that&rsquo;s a visual cue for you to look up the creature&rsquo;s stat block in the Monster Manual, unless the adventure&rsquo;s text instead refers you to the monster appendix in this adventure.</p>
<p>Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook. Magic items are described in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that&rsquo;s meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to the players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes like this one. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe locations or present bits of scripted dialogue.</p>

Let the player choose one of the pregenerated sidekicks that come with this adventure. If a sidekick is lost or no longer needed, the player character can return to Leilon and acquire a new one.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.</li>
<li>Ideally, a sidekick&rsquo;s abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a fighter or rogue.</li>

You are empowered to modify the number of enemies in an encounter and their hit point totals as you see fit. If you need to adjust the difficulty of an encounter during combat, you can alter hit point totals without the player characters ever knowing and have enemies retreat or reinforcements arrive as needed.</p>

The settlement has been destroyed and rebuilt many times in its long history, and it is currently in an early stage of a rebuilding period.</p>
<p>The settlers tasked with rebuilding Leilon are funded by the Lord Protector of Neverwinter, Dagult Neverember. Lord Neverember hopes the town can act as a safe waypoint between the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep, as well as protect travelers from threats originating in the swampy Mere of Dead Men.</p>
<p>As the adventure progresses, the characters become embroiled not only in the rebuilding of Leilon, but also in the power struggle that unfolds between the settlers of Leilon and terrible forces that seek their destruction.</p>

<p>Two forces of evil rise nearby, eager to control the region around Leilon and eventually the Sword Coast. The first is a cult of Talos, god of storms, led by the priestess Fheralai Stormsworn. The cult&rsquo;s headquarters are inside a death knight-dreadnaught, an undead battleship beached near a temple of Talos called the Tower of Storms.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ularan Mortus, a priest of the god of death Myrkul, and his followers are raising an army of undead to lay siege to the city of Neverwinter. The spirit of the dead black dragon Chardansearavitriol, also known as Ebondeath, aids Ularan Mortus in exchange for help finding and seizing the body of a living dragon to inhabit.</p>
<p>The people of Leilon are completely unaware of these threats, as they focus on more immediate dangers, like the wild animals and monstrous beasts lairing in the Mere of Dead Men. As the adventurers interact with the villagers, helping them rebuild and fighting off the immediate dangers, the specters of these two larger threats begin to grow and take shape.</p>
<p>Over the course of the trilogy (<em>Storm Lord&rsquo;s Wrath</em>, Sleeping Dragon&rsquo;s Wake, and Divine Contention), the adventurers must deal with the two main forces of evil, as well as many smaller threats, not to mention the many little dramas of a group of settlers trying to work in harmony on a project that might be too big for them. With the help of the heroes, however, the settlers of Leilon just might survive.</p>
<p>This adventure begins at a modest roadside inn, where the characters can make some friends and get the first taste of the larger battle in which they are about to become embroiled.</p>

This gives you a unique opportunity, because the adventurers can put their own stamp on the town in a very real and personal way.</p>
<p>In this initial adventure, the town is little more than a few ramshackle buildings and foundations. The people and locations of Leilon can be altered or wholly created anew by you, the DM, based on the interests of the adventurers.</p>
<p>For example, the Shrine of Lathander is being built by Merrygold Brightshine, priest of the Morninglord. If any of the characters revere Lathander, they might use their resources (wealth, downtime days, connections, etc.) to assist in its construction, making the shrine more grandiose than it might otherwise be.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if one of the characters worships a different deity, they might decide to invest in a temple to their god, in which case a temple of some other power might replace the Shrine of Lathander, bringing a new NPC to town to oversee it.</p>
