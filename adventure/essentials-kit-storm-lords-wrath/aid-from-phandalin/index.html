Nestled into the hills of the Sword Mountains, it has become a bustling area of trade and mining since brave heroes vanquished some of the threats to the area.</p>

One of the town residents, a gnome named Pinchwit Wigglehoof, is an expert goatherd. But her flock of goats are no normal herd. She raises Giant Goat, excellent producers of milk and meat, and even their goat-hair is highly valued for its tensile strength and warmth.</p>
<p>Elmar Barthen, proprietor of Barthen&rsquo;s Provisions in Phandalin, is brokering a deal with a wealthy Waterdhavian merchant to sell some of Pinchwit&rsquo;s stock for a very lucrative profit. As a goatherd in the employ of Dagult Neverember and the town of Leilon, Pinchwit&rsquo;s profits are the town&rsquo;s profits.</p>
<p>However, part of the deal is that the goats must be brought to Phandalin. While Pinchwit is an excellent goatherd, she is less capable as a fighter. She and her goats need an escort from Leilon to Phandalin. The town council of Leilon also asks the characters to buy wagons to bring back a plethora of supplies that the town needs.</p>
<p>The distance from Leilon to Phandalin is only twenty-one miles or so, but the route goes through forest and grassland unsullied by anything resembling a road or a path. Pinchwit wants to keep the flock off the main roads.</p>
<p>Additionally, goats are not the most obedient animals in the wide kingdom of creatures. They can only travel about three miles per day, making the trip to Phandalin a seven-day ordeal. And with a couple hundred unruly goats, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

<h3 id=goat-check>
<a href=#goat-check class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Goat Check</h3><p>At some point during the trip, a pair of Wyvern fly above the goat-train heading for Phandalin. The wyverns do not attack; even with their limited intelligence, they understand that such a large group of people could prove dangerous to them.</p>
<p>The goats, however, panic at the sight of these large predators, causing them to flee in every direction. The characters must do everything in their power to keep the goats together, because the wyverns do not hesitate to pick off stragglers.</p>
<h5 id=herding>
<a href=#herding class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Herding</h5><p>When the goats bolt, each character can attempt a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check. If at least half of the checks succeed, the characters manage to keep the herd together, and the wyverns move on to easier pickings. If the checks fail, the herd breaks up, leaving many goats vulnerable to wyvern attacks. If this happens, the characters have a choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can stay together, saving half the herd but losing many of the goats to the wyvern attack. This reduces that money that the town could make from the merchant.</li>
<li>They can split up and each go after one of the groups of goats that split off. That means, however, that half the group must fight one wyvern, and the other half must fight the other, and they are 3000 feet away from each other, likely unable to help each other.</li>
</ul>

Being ogres, always hungry and particularly grumpy around goats, the ogres decide to attack.</p>
<p>Assuming some of the characters are sleeping for the night, anyone on guard duty can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check to notice that the goats are getting restless. This gives those on guard three rounds to wake up any sleepers and take precautions.</p>
<p>After three rounds, the Ogre, numbering three plus one per character, excluding sidekicks, charge out of the darkness and begin grabbing goats. When the characters intervene, the ogres drop the goats and attempt to smash the adventurers.</p>

If that is the case, then they have their own stories and their own relationships with the people of Phandalin. The town and the NPCs, as they are presented here, should be seen as just the beginning. You should change the attitudes of the NPCs, or the actual NPCs themselves, based on what has come to pass in your campaign.</p>
<p>If the characters have not been to Phandalin, you can learn more about the town in the <em>D&D Starter Set</em> or <em>D&D Essentials Kit</em>. If you do not wish to purchase any products that detail Phandalin, you can create your own Phandalin based on the areas described in this adventure.</p>

The characters are free to go to the merchant&rsquo;s establishment with her, or they can explore the town, picking up a wagon and the supplies needed by the town of Leilon.</p>
<p>If the characters are heroes of the town, they are greeted as such wherever they go. Townsfolk who know them offer free food and drink, with plenty of handshakes, pats on the back, and requests for autographs.</p>

Toblen Stonehill, a short, friendly human, runs the establishment.</p>
<p>While the characters are in the common room at night, Toblen looks up as the door opens. The door closes quickly without anyone entering, and Toblen shakes his head in wonder. He says he thinks it was Argus Skeel who just opened the door and left immediately. Skeel is a newcomer who claims to be a prospector but never seems to be prospecting. He only comes around at night.</p>
<h5 id=following-skeel>

Skeel lives in the cellar of this building with a number of ghouls that he commands. (See &ldquo;<strong>area The Attack</strong>&rdquo; below for more information on Skeel and the ghouls.)</p>
<p>If the characters follow Skeel into the shack, they cannot find him. A DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check finds the secret door in the floor leading to the basement, where the undead hide. If the characters find and deal with them here, the undead don&rsquo;t attack as the characters try to leave town.</p>

She doesn&rsquo;t have any carts for sale but tells the characters that they can probably pick some up at the Miner&rsquo;s Exchange in town.</p>
<p>Linene has a new assistant, a red-haired elf going by the name of Velleen Firecrow. Velleen makes deliveries and manages trade in the surrounding area, with a team of kobolds who seem to adore her. Velleen is also a member of the Cult of Talos, acting as a spy for the comings and goings in Phandalin. (See &ldquo;<strong>area The Attack</strong>&rdquo; below for more information on Velleen and the kobolds.)</p>
<p>If the characters find the Talos symbol at the Shrine of Luck and show it to Linene, she recognizes it as something Velleen wears as a brooch, although she hasn&rsquo;t seen her wearing it in a couple of days.</p>
<p>If the characters approach Velleen about her lost brooch, the cultist and her kobold servants attack. If they are defeated, the characters do not have to face them later as they pack to leave the town.</p>

Elmar and Ander know rumors and are happy to spread them, but Thistle is a little more reluctant to talk. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check reveals his nervous reticence.</p>
<p>If the characters push him for information, he can be prompted to talk with a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check. He then admits that he has taken a liking to Velleen, the new assistant at the Lionshield Coster. They were spending time together, getting to know each other, when she started talking about some scary stuff. She believes the Stormlord is going to come and wipe out the weak and the nonbelievers, and that he should join her. He&rsquo;s avoided her since then.</p>

Halia knows about the spies in town, but she won&rsquo;t reveal anything without getting paid at least 50 gp for the information.</p>
<p>She is willing to tell the characters as much or as little information as you want her to provide. And if the characters treat her rudely or try to pay her less than she asks, she happily tells Skeel, Velleen, or both exactly what the characters know and what their plans are.</p>

When the characters arrive, the place is empty, and the shrine has been ransacked. There is no sign of anyone who worked here, but with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check, the characters find a silver pin displaying three parallel lightning bolts. This should indicate to them that worshippers of Talos are in town.</p>

Harbin Wester, the townmaster and a wealthy banker, is polite if the characters see him, although he seems to be worried and fretfulâ€”more so than usual.</p>
<p>If the characters ask, he confides in them that the weather has been particularly fierce recently. Winds have come out of nowhere and damaged buildings, and three people have been struck by lightning.</p>
<p>Also, a few people seem to have gone missing over the last couple of tendays. No one can say for sure, because the people who may be missing are visitors or travelers with no ties to Phandalin. It&rsquo;s possible that they simply left town, but some of them seemed to indicate that they were going to be around longer.</p>

<p>When the characters are packing up to take the supplies back to Leilon at the end of their visit, the spies from both the Cult of Talos and the followers of Myrkul independently decide they are too big a threat to let live. (If the characters have already dealt with both spies, this encounter doesn&rsquo;t happen.)</p>
<p>Use the Backlot Map to run this encounter. As the characters load the wagons, storm clouds descend and block the sun. Argus Skeel (male vampire spawn) and two Ghoul, plus one ghoul per character, including sidekicks, approach. If it is daylight, Argus wears heavy clothes to protect himself.</p>
<p>At the same time, Velleen Firecrow and two Kobold Dragonshield (see appendix A), plus one dragonshield per character, including sidekicks, approach from the other direction. Velleen is a female Damaran master thief (see appendix A).</p>
<p>As the combat begins, the two evil groups recognize each other, and also attack one another when appropriate. (See &ldquo;Running a Three-sided Battle&rdquo; sidebar for advice.)</p>

A battle involving three different sides at the same time can provide all of those highlights writ large. Running such a combat, however, takes care and practice.</p>
<p>With a three-sided combat, it is very easy to simply overwhelm the characters if you turn all the attention on the party. On the other hand, such a combat can be too easy if the other two sides simply wipe each other out while the adventurers watch.</p>
<p>Below are some tips for running a three-sided combat:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start by focusing most attacks on the characters. Doing this establishes the tone and danger of the situation quickly. The players should be aware from the outset that if all the enemies turned on them at once, the encounter would likely go very poorly for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep a close eye on the hit points of the characters. When the adventurers begin to feel a sense of hopelessness or peril beyond their capability, then have the other sides focus on each other for a while, giving the characters a chance to recover and regroup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage tactical thinking. If one of the sides of the battle consists of savage monsters or mindless undead, give clues that they attack the nearest enemy rather than thinking tactically. This might encourage characters to move away from those enemies, or push other enemies into their path. This highlights the kind of tactical play that some players thrive on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End dramatically. Three-sided battles can sometimes take longer because of the number of combatants participating. Use your discretion as the DM to have the excitement of the battle build up rather than fizzle out. When it&rsquo;s clear that the characters have the upper hand, turn on the monster toward them. But when it is clear that the characters will be victorious, have the remaining enemies fall quickly to avoid a drawn-out and anticlimactic denouement.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The ghouls working for Skeel bear the same skull marks at the ones who attacked the Wayside Inn during the introduction of this adventure. Skeel&rsquo;s clothes are riddled with thorns and barbed seeds from plants that are only found in the Mere of Dead Men. This can indicate to the characters that the larger undead threat may stem from that marsh.</p>
<p>Velleen and her kobolds each conceal hidden symbols of the Cult of Talos. She also carries a case containing a pair of lenses and a note in Common that says, &ldquo;The lenses show the secrets of the map.&rdquo; If these lenses are used to view the map found in the basement of the Wayside Inn, it reveals secret writing that points out various other locations of Cult of Talos activity up and down the Sword Coast, with the Thunder Cliffs circled as the central hub of activity.</p>
