Spiral Staircase</h2><blockquote>
<p>The staircase is badly rusted but appears to be sturdy. The air inside the passageway is warm, humid, and rather foul. You reach the bottom of the stairs with a splashâ€”the floor is submerged beneath a foot of water!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spiral staircase descends about 100 feet before ending in <strong>area 1</strong>. Sensitive characters will feel it thrumming to a continuous low vibration (this vibration from the Plume geyser will be noticeable everywhere in the dungeon). In the humidity, lamps and torches will burn fitfully and give off a lot of smoke.</p>
<p>Floating on the water are splotches of green and white subterranean algae. This algae or algae-like fungus also clings in patches to walls and ceilings. It is harmless, and can be found almost everywhere in the dungeon where there is water.</p>

Riddling Guardian</h2><p>A rather mangy, bedraggled gynosphinx squats in the space where the three corridors converge. A wall of force along the south side separates the gynosphinx from those who approach from that direction. This wall of force is weaker than most, and can be brought down by <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type=spell>passwall</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>The sphinx will let the characters pass (by removing the wall of force) if they can answer the following riddle:</p>
<p><em>Round she is, yet flat as a board</em></p>
<p><em>Altar of the Lupine Lords</em></p>
<p><em>Jewel on black velvet, pearl in the sea</em></p>
<p><em>Unchanged but e&rsquo;erchanging, eternally</em></p>
<p>The answer is &ldquo;the Moon.&rdquo; If the wall of force is destroyed or circumvented, the sphinx will attack.</p>

Hidden Slime</h2><p>Midway along the corridor that runs northeast, the floor is covered by a large patch of green slime (see &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>). Because the slime is covered by water, it is not easily detectable, and characters might walk through it and not even notice they have done so until it has eaten through their boots and started on their feet.</p>
<h2 id=4-glass-globes>
<a href=#4-glass-globes class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>4. Glass Globes</h2><p>The door to this room appears normal on the way in: a large iron-bound oak door, swollen by dampness and difficult to open. When the characters have entered the room (or as many of them as are going in), the door will slam shut behind them. No tools, weapons, or magic available to the adventurers will open the door or prevent it from closing. Only the proper key inserted in the keyhole on the inside of the door will unlock it.</p>
<p>In the room, suspended from the ceiling by unbreakable wires, are nine silvered glass spheres, each about 2 feet in diameter. Unless otherwise noted, magically looking inside a sphere, such as with a clairvoyance spell or a ring of x-ray vision, will show that it contains some apparent treasure and a key. (Each sphere holds a key, but only one of the keys opens the door.) A good, hard crack with a weapon will shatter any of the spheres (each has AC 13 and 3 hit points), dropping its contents (if not caught) into the muck below.</p>
<p>Number the globes 1 through 9 for your own reference. The globes contain the following items:</p>

When the ring is released from the sphere, it speaks to the characters telepathically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Stop before you put me on. I confer the following powers upon my wearer: invisibility, haste, immunity to charms, fly once per day, detect magic, and one wish. I also provide the benefits of protection and spell turning. The only drawback is that once a year I permanently eat a small part of your life. I must be worn before I can leave this room; merely carrying me away is not possible. If ever I am removed from my wearer&rsquo;s finger, however, all my powers are lost. So you must decide right now who will wear me forever.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This situation is a basic loyalty and intelligence test.</p>
<p>Will the party members cut each others' throats over the ring? Will they be suspicious enough to simply leave it alone? If they take time to think about it, they&rsquo;ll likely realize that the ring must be a hoax.</p>
<p>Someone who puts it on can cause it to exhibit any of the powers mentioned above, except for the wish spell, as long as it remains in the room. While it is located here, the ring enables the wearer to produce the indicated spell effects at will (except for fly), and it also acts as a ring of spell turning and a ring of protection.</p>
<p>Once the ring leaves the area, however, it has no abilities and can&rsquo;t talk.</p>

Numbered Golems</h2><blockquote>
<p>Five flesh golems are clustered against the north wall. Each has a number on its chest: 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Number 5 says, &ldquo;One of us does not belong with the others. If you can pick it out, it will serve you, and the others will allow you passage. If you pick the wrong one, we will kill you. You have sixty seconds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The correct choice is 9, because it is not a prime number. Give the players an actual 60 seconds to figure it out.</p>
<p>If the characters give the wrong answer, roll initiative. The golems lumber forward to confront the intruders, trying to prevent anyone from moving through the door to the north. The monsters will pursue enemies that flee to the south, but they won&rsquo;t climb the stairs that led to <strong>area 6</strong>.</p>
<p>If the characters answer the riddle correctly, events unfold as promised: the golem numbered 9 becomes an ally of the party, accompanying the characters if they so desire, and the other four golems become inert again.</p>

Turnstile</h2><blockquote>
<p>A short flight of stairs leads up to a dry corridor. Just around the corner is a turnstile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characters will discover that the turnstile rotates in only one direction (counterclockwise). They can pass through it easily when moving to the east, but it will probably have to be destroyed on the way back.

Geysers and Chains</h2><blockquote>
<p>The door opens onto a stone platform in a large natural cave. Opposite the entrance in the distance is another stone platform. Between them, a series of wooden disks is suspended from the ceiling by massive steel chains. The cave floor seems to be covered by a pool of boiling mud.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The ceiling is 50 feet above the level of the platforms. The cave floor is 50 feet below. Two spots in the mud are the locations of geysers. The northern one erupts once every 5 minutes, the southern one every 3 minutes. The stone platform opposite the entrance is approximately 90 feet away.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The disks are about 4 feet in diameter and 3 feet apart. Each disk is attached to its chain by a giant staple fixed in its center. The disks swing freely and will tilt when weight is placed upon them.</p>
<p>The disks and the chains, as well as the walls of the cavern, are covered with a wet, slippery algal scum. This coating gives off a feeble phosphorescent glow. Climbing the chains or the walls requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>When the geysers erupt, they reach nearly to the roof of the cavern, and creatures holding onto the disks or the chains might be washed off to fall into the boiling mud. The damage a creature takes from a geyser depends on how close a creature is to the geyser when it erupts (see the table below). Creatures that succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw take half damage.</p>
<p>In addition, a creature that is on a disk or holding onto a chain when a geyser erupts must succeed on a Strength saving throw (see the table for DCs) or be knocked off and fall into the boiling mud.</p>

Coffin</h2><blockquote>
<p>The door opens into an area of utter blackness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The room beyond the door is the lair of a vampire named Ctenmiir. He is compelled by a curse to remain here in a trance except when roused to defend his treasure, which lies in a niche in the floor under his coffin. The vampire automatically awakes at the approach of intruders.</p>
<p>The room is affected by a darkness spell, which the vampire is not hindered by because he has truesight. If the vampire needs to leave this area to pursue intruders, the door to the room is littered with tiny holes through which he can pass in mist form. If the magical darkness is dispelled, it renews again automatically at dawn.</p>

<p>In the eastern wing of the pool are two partly enclosed areas with entrances that are accessible only from beneath the surface of the water. These areas are partially covered by a roof along the east edge, where the water is only 1 foot deep. The southern chamber is the kelpies' lair, which contains their treasure.

<p>Anyone who tries out the bed will find that it feels quite uncomfortable, and anybody who samples the food will be disappointed in the extreme, finding it tough and not very tasty.</p>
<p>In fact, the room is covered in illusions; a true seeing spell or similar illusion-piercing magic reveals that the opulent bed is only an old straw mattress, and the delicious treats are just ordinary rations. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the room are quite bare. A dispel magic spell will automatically remove the illusion.</p>

It is fed by an underground stream that enters from the northwest at a depth 100 feet below that of the ledge. Its runoff flows through a channel to the east, above the ledge, near the ceiling of the cavern.</p>
<p>Any creature that enters the boiling lake takes 44 (8d10) fire damage immediately and again at the start of each of its turns for as long as it remains in the lake.</p>

There the water strikes molten rock and is instantly converted to steam. It is ejected up the blow hole and out the top of the volcanic cone, forming the continuous geyser of White Plume Mountain. The boiling water here is just as dangerous as the water in <strong>area 15</strong>.</p>

The Boiling Bubble</h2><p>A sunken stone ledge projects out into the boiling lake. The corridor from the dungeon continues out into the lake under a magical force field that keeps out the water by forming a sort of elastic skin. The shape of the corridor is not square in cross-section, but rather semicircular, as if a series of hoops were supporting the ceiling.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span></p>
<p>The protective skin is soft, resilient, and uncomfortably warm to the touch. Under any pressure it immediately becomes taut, and any character unwise enough to puncture it with a piercing weapon will cause a stream of scalding water to rush into the corridor, hopefully burning the idiot who made the hole for 2 (1d4) fire damage. Thereafter, any creature that enters the space with this stream of scalding water or that starts its turn there takes that damage. The skin will not &ldquo;heal&rdquo; once it is compromised. Major damage to the skin, as from a slash with a sword or an axe, will collapse the field like a deflating balloon in 1d6 rounds.</p>
<p>After 30 feet the corridor gives way to an oval-shaped, domed area enclosed by the protective skin. Here lives the guardian of the treasure, a Huge giant crab that has the following changes, which increase its challenge rating to 8 (3,900 XP):</p>
<ul>
<li>It has 161 (14d12+70) hit points.</li>
<li>Its Strength and Constitution are 20 (+5).</li>
<li>On one of its claws it wears a rune-covered copper band that makes it immune to being charmed, frightened, and paralyzed. (The copper band is worthless as a treasure, for the magic is keyed to this crab.)</li>
<li>It has an improved claw attack:</li>
</ul>

Hit: 27 (4d10+5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). The crab has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.</p>
<p>The crab will intelligently attack intruders, being careful not to bump the protective skin walls. The crab is experienced in fighting in this manner, as is evidenced by the bones scattered about, but the characters are not. You will have to watch for characters whose actions might rip the water skin, especially any foolish enough to use two-handed weapons or a violent spell such as fireball or lightning bolt. Such people are likely to get the whole party boiled.</p>

<p>Characters protected by the cube will probably end up being blown out the geyser at the top of the mountain. The air-filled cube will float, drain down the cascade, and be ejected from the Plume-a rocky ride.</p>

Metal-Heating Corridor</h2><blockquote>
<p>A series of copper-colored metal plates lines the walls of the path before you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plates are 6 feet high and 6 feet wide, and cannot be damaged or removed. They produce an invisible electrical field that extends from floor to ceiling throughout the 70-foot-long corridor. The field isn&rsquo;t directly harmful, but metal objects that pass between the plates become heated. Metal will become uncomfortably warm after moving 20 feet into the field, painfully hot after 30 feet, and hot enough to deal fire damage at 40 feet and beyond. The field affects armor, weapons, equipment, and even treasure made of metal.</p>
<p>A character in metal armor who tries to move through this corridor would take damage as follows: 4 (1d8) fire damage at 40 feet, another 9 (2d8) fire damage at 50 feet, an additional 16 (3d10) fire damage at 60 feet, and another 22 (4d10) fire damage at 70 feet.</p>
<p>Characters not wearing metal armor but carrying metal weapons or equipment will feel only slight discomfort when passing between the plates. Metal carried in wrappings of cloth will burn through by the 50-foot mark, and it will similarly burn through leather by the 60-foot mark. Armored characters might have no recourse other than to remove their armor, then drag, push, or use magic to get their metal armor and weapons through the corridor, and then suit up again. Armor pulled through the corridor by ropes will heat up enough to burn through the ropes at 60 feet, leaving a pile of hot metal lying in the water.</p>
<p>The only sovereign remedies for this dilemma are area effects that deal cold damage, such as ice storm or cone of cold, which will nullify the effect long enough for the party to dash through.</p>

Frictionless Trap</h2><p>When the characters pass through the door from <strong>area 21</strong>, describe the features of the room beyond depending on how much of the chamber they can see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The path to the west is broken by a sizable gap, and you can see the glint of metal at the bottom of the opening. The floor beyond this area has a silvery sheen.</p>
<p>In the distance you can see another hole, beyond which is a patch of floor that adjoins the western wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The openings in the floor are pits, each 5 feet wide and 10 feet deep. Their bottoms are lined with rusty, razor-like blades. Anyone who falls in takes 6 (1d12) damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease called super-tetanus (see below).</p>
<p>The walls, ceiling, and floor of the area between the pits are covered with a substance that is totally frictionless. This silvery stuff is inert and utterly unaffected by any force, magical or otherwise. Anything that alights on the surface will move in the direction of its last horizontal impetus, bouncing off the walls (if it strikes them) like a billiard ball, until it slides into a razor-pit. It is impossible for a creature even to stand still on the surface, for the slightest movement in any direction would unbalance it enough to send it moving in that direction.</p>
<p>Magic that augments movement (such as fly, jump, and levitate) and teleportation effects do not work in this room.</p>
<p>The line near the west edge of the room is the illusion of a wall-the actual wall is 10 feet farther away. Objects that make contact with the illusory wall will pass through it and seemingly disappear. This fact tends to frustrate (at least initially) any scheme for attaching a rope to the west wall from afar.</p>
<p>In fact, however, one way to get safely across is to get a rope strung through the room and fastened securely at both ends. Once this is done, characters can pull themselves across the floor and are able to control their speed. A clever party might be able to come up with other methods. Ingenuity is required.</p>

<p>Water not only flows through this room, it floats.</p>
<p>Entering a hole in the western wall, two feet off the floor, is a stream seemingly suspended in mid-air. It flows out of another hole near the northeast corner. The water is about three feet deep. You can see a few blind cave fish being carried along in the brisk current.</p>
<p>On either side of the door are a total of six kayaks, each able to carry two riders, but there are no paddles to be found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stream is hemispherical in cross-section where it flows through the room. The entrance and exit holes are 6 feet in diameter; they are the ends of a tunnel that connects this room with <strong>area 24</strong>.</p>
<p>The water is lukewarm. Objects can be thrust through the sides of the stream, but no water other than a few drops will escape. It would even be possible to walk right through the stream, but only a very strong creature could do so without being swept off its feet (requiring a DC 15 Strength saving throw). The stream flows quite quickly from west to east.</p>
<p>If characters choose to go boating into the unknown tunnel, they will have to figure out how to get in the kayaks once the kayaks are placed in the stream, the surface of which is 5 feet off the floor. These vessels tip over easily. If they successfully board the kayaks, the characters will bump along through a twisting tunnel 6 feet across. They can regulate their speed by pushing against the walls. Eventually they will emerge into <strong>area 24</strong>.</p>

Sir Bluto&rsquo;s Guardpost</h2><p>A fallen knight named Sir Bluto Sans Pite (a NE champion; and his eight minions (NE human knight) wait here to ambush any who come through the tunnel. They will be alerted by disturbances in the flow of water as the party tampers with it upstream. The stream that flows through this room is suspended in the same manner as in <strong>area 23</strong>. It continues from north to south out of <strong>area 24</strong> and back to <strong>area 23</strong>, completing the circuit.</p>
<p>Sir Bluto&rsquo;s knights work in two teams of four, with two team members on each side of the stream. When a kayak comes out, a team will throw a large net over it and attempt to drag it and its occupants out of the stream and down onto the floor. When it falls, they move in to finish off the occupants with swords. To escape from a net, a creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a successful check. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees a creature without harming it; any other creature in the same net can then use its action to free itself through that opening.</p>
<p>Sir Bluto was a respected Knight of the Realm before his indictment in the River of Blood mass-murder case. His mysterious disappearance from prison left even the Royal Magician-Detectives baffled, and a reward of 10,000 gp was posted for his capture.

Terraced Aquarium</h2><blockquote>
<p>You are looking out and down into an enormous chamber defined by terraced steps that ring the entire area and descend toward a central enclosure.</p>
<p>A few feet south of the door, water laps at the edge of the stone floor. Looking to the side, you can see that the ring of the terrace that lies beyond is a ten-foot-deep ring of water held in by a nearly transparent wall. Another of these watery steps in the terrace is somewhat lower than the first; at the level in between these aquariums, the terrace steps are dry, but the area is still enclosed by a glassy wall like the others.</p>

<p>Each tier in the room is 10 feet in depth and width. The three middle levels are enclosed by 10-foot-tall glass walls that keep the inhabitants of those tiers confined. The two on either side are filled with water. All the creatures in this room have been charmed and ordered to stay in their areas as long as their glass walls are intact.</p>
<p>A 10-foot-square area of glass wall has AC 15, and 20 hit points. The glass can also be broken with a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p>
<p>The only exit from the room is the door that leads south out of the bottom tier. It opens into a corridor that passes under the higher tiers of the room.</p>
<h3 id=breaking-glass>

If the glass is broken on both of the aquariums, the volume of water is sufficient to fill the two lower tiers and cover the floor of the middle tier to a depth of about 2 feet. The water will slowly drain out of four small drains in the corners of the bottom tier, but it will take a good three hours to do so. Of course, characters who choose to wait will be subject to the possibility of random encounters. Once the water is finally gone, the wall of force will disappear.</p>
<p>If the characters destroy the wall of force, the pressure of the water will push open the door and the water will rush into the corridor beyond, pulling along any swimming characters and miscellaneous debris nearby. The water will collide with another wall of force that covers the door to <strong>area 27</strong>, and then begin draining out through a grating in the floor in the last 10 feet of the passage. The water will take only 20 minutes to drain out through this grating. (The water drains straight down through an old lava tube to a large cave with no other exits.) When the water is gone, the wall of force barring entry to <strong>area 27</strong> dissipates.</p>

They are accustomed to live food, and will ignore dead meat or other nonliving sustenance. They consider any living creature that enters their domain as food, and will attempt to eat it.</p>
<p>No creatures inhabit the top tier of the terrace. The aquarium tier inside that area is occupied by six giant crayfish. The next lower tier is a dry level where the glass walls enclose six giant scorpion. Beneath and inside that is an aquarium that holds four sea lion.</p>
<p>On the bottom tier are three wing-clipped manticore that are unable to fly. The manticores will not hesitate to fire their spikes at any they recognize as intruders.</p>

<p>Lavish furnishings and decorations are everywhere in this large room. The floor is strewn with rugs and cushions, and tapestries cover the walls. A hookah as tall as an adult human stands in one corner. The largest piece of furniture is a sumptuous divan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The room is the residence of Qesnef, an oni who lost a bet with Keraptis and as a result must confine himself in these luxurious surroundings, guarding his treasure, for 1,001 years. A magic mouth spell warns him of the approach of trespassers, so he will disguise himself by using his Change Shape ability to take the form of a doughty halfling warrior, claiming to be someone who has been trapped by the evil wizard.</p>

The hoard includes <wc-fetch type=item>Blackrazor</wc-fetch>, a sentient greatsword (see &ldquo;Sample Sentient Items&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide), 1,000 ep, 200 pp, four pieces of jewelry worth a total of 11,000 gp, a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of greater healing</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type=item>scroll of protection from fiends</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=item>armor of vulnerability (slashing)</wc-fetch>.</p>

A voice will speak to them out of the air:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Not thinking of leaving, are you? You&rsquo;ve been so very entertaining. I just couldn&rsquo;t think of letting you go, especially with those little items of mine. And since you&rsquo;ve eliminated all of their guardians, why, you&rsquo;ll simply have to stay&mldr; to take their places. I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to leave all of your ridiculous weapons behind and let Nix and Nox escort you to the Indoctrination Center. I&rsquo;ll be most disappointed if you cause me any trouble and Nix and Nox have to eliminate you. Don&rsquo;t worry-you&rsquo;ll like it here.&rdquo;</p>

If the party can get past them, they&rsquo;re home free.</p>
<p>Of course, this whole episode can be omitted if the party has already taken too much damage. Conversely, if the characters have had too easy a time of it, this final challenge can be made tougher by the addition of one or two more efreet (called Box and Cox).</p>
<p>If, for some foolish reason, the party decides to comply with Keraptis&rsquo;s request and go with Nix and Nox to the Indoctrination Center, you will have to play it by ear. It&rsquo;s not too difficult-use your imagination and make it up as you go. Just make sure that the characters are extremely sorry they ever decided to submit to Keraptis&rsquo;s demands. They probably will end up as the brainwashed new guards in Keraptis&rsquo;s renewed version of White Plume Mountain&rsquo;s dungeon.</p>
