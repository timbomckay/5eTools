<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Durgeddin&rsquo;s followers lived and worked in a series of carved halls and chambers beyond the Glitterhame. Most of this part of the complex was thoroughly ransacked when the dwarven citadel fell.</p>
<p>Unlike the Mountain Door or the Glitterhame, which offer exits to the surface world, the Foundry isn&rsquo;t readily accessible. The area isn&rsquo;t abandoned, though. Undead horrors wait in its darkest recesses, and dwarf-crafted traps still work perfectly well despite their age. In addition, a small number of duergar have come here to breathe life into Durgeddin&rsquo;s old forges and decipher the secrets of the master smith&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>If the characters come to this part of the complex from the Black Lake (see the &ldquo;Dark Mere&rdquo; subsection of &ldquo;Scout the Area&rdquo;), they begin in <strong>area 38</strong>.</p>

Those who fall in risk being swept away by the current.</p>
<p>A creature that falls in the river and is within 5 feet of the water&rsquo;s edge must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw to catch itself on the rocky bank. On a failed save, or if the creature is too far away from the bank, it is drawn into the main current.</p>
<p>A creature in the main current that takes no other action is swept 60 feet downstream (to the south or to the west, depending on location) each round. If it spends its action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check and the check is a success, it can reduce the distance traveled by the amount of its walking speed and move toward a bank.</p>
<p>On a failed check, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>. Creatures that have a swim speed can take the Dash action and use their full swim speed without making a Strength check. A creature within 5 feet of a bank can pull itself out of the current as part of its move.</p>

Chamber of Statues</h2><p>In the corridor behind the iron door in <strong>area 27</strong>, a flight of steep stone stairs climbs 30 feet northward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stairs end at the entrance to an octagonal chamber. The floor is inlaid with cracked, dusty blue tiles, and the walls are dressed with polished marble. Large doors of iron-bound oak exit to the northwest and northeast.</p>
<p>Three cast bronze statues, almost ten feet tall, stand by the west, north, and east walls. Each depicts an armed dwarf. The eastern and western ones carry axes and shields. The center statue is armed with two axes. The ceiling rises in a dome almost thirty feet above the floor.</p>
<p>From somewhere in the distance, you can hear the faint ringing of hammer on anvil.</p>
</blockquote>

</span></p>
<p>The sound of the hammering comes from beyond the east wall, as can be determined with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Anyone who examines the floor notices that the dust is somewhat disturbed. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals an infrequently used trail that leads from the entrance stairs to the stone wall behind the east statue.</p>
<h3 id=statue-trap>
<a href=#statue-trap class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Statue Trap</h3><p>The obvious exits to the northeast and northwest are false doors that open onto blank stone. Pulling on either door releases a catch that causes the axe-wielding hands of the two closest statues to drop. Any creature within 5 feet of a door when it is opened is subjected to two melee attacks: +5 to hit; 9 (2d8) slashing damage on a hit.</p>
<p>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can discern small scorings on the floor in front of a door, left by earlier axe strokes. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check enables a character to deduce that the doors aren&rsquo;t what they seem, through small clues showing that they are unused. The same check focused on a statue can reveal a small line on the arm that holds an axe, indicating the arm&rsquo;s ability to move.</p>
<p>A character who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools can jam a statue&rsquo;s arm so that the axe can&rsquo;t swing. Destroying a statue (AC 18, 60 hit points, immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage) also disables its attack.</p>
<p>Once a statue has attacked, the trap must be reset manually. If any duergar survive and remain here, they reset the trap within a day after it has been triggered.</p>

If the characters detected the faint trail that leads there, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check locates the door. Beyond is a flight of stone stairs that leads upward.</p>
<p>The stairs have been warded with a magical alarm. When a creature ascends past the halfway point of the staircase, a <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell calls out in Dwarvish,</p>

The Great Hall</h2><p>At the top of the stairs from <strong>area 35</strong> is a stone door carved with a glowering dwarf&rsquo;s face. It opens easily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This enormous hall is lined with ten great pillars, carved into the forms of giants and dragons, that support the vaulted ceiling high above. Guttering orange torches set in sconces along the walls illuminate the room, and a mighty throne sits on a dais at the opposite end. The walls were once covered with tile mosaics, but they have been smashed and defiled by graffiti. Tiny fragments of tile litter the floor. You can see five other exits.</p>
<p>A small fire smolders on the floor before the dais, where six sleeping pallets lie empty, surrounded by packs and supplies. The sound of hammers ringing on iron comes from beyond the doors to the south.</p>
<p>Suddenly a harsh voice calls from the shadows of the pillars, &ldquo;Go back the way you came! This is the only warning you&rsquo;ll get!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cavern was formerly Durgeddin&rsquo;s throne room, banquet hall, and center of authority. Its ceiling is 30 feet high, and the sconces are 10 feet above the floor. The throne is unremarkable: a short bench of stone that might have been decorated at some point in the past. The graffiti consists of crude epithets in the Orc language insulting dwarves and their ancestry.</p>

Ghared shouts the initial warning and speaks for the group; she&rsquo;s suspicious, greedy, and arrogant, but not stupid. She is willing to give information to the party if a character succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The characters can change her attitude to indifferent, reducing the check DC to 10, with a suitable bribe (at least 100 gp).</p>
<p>Ghared can share any of the following information if the party succeeds in getting her to converse:</p>
<ul>
<li>The doors to the north lead to halls infested with undead and cursed magic.</li>
<li>The door to the southwest leads into the old kitchens, guarded by more cursed magic.</li>
<li>A dragon lives in a large lake cavern deep below.</li>
<li>The subterranean river flows from the lake through other parts of the complex below the Glitterhame. It&rsquo;s fed from a lake on the surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>If negotiations are successful, the duergar are willing to let the party enter the rooms to the north. With a sufficiently high Charisma (Persuasion) check and an indifferent attitude from Ghared, the characters can get the duergar to escort them to the entrance to the dragon&rsquo;s territory (the chasm in <strong>area 38</strong>). The duergar will not allow the party into the bladeworks (<strong>area 37</strong>) without an escort, and they prohibit entry into <strong>area 39</strong>.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t negotiate, or if talks go badly, combat ensues.</p>

They use their Enlarge ability in the next round, taking cover behind two of the pillars before wading into melee.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ghared remains invisible and maneuvers to make a sneak attack, then enlarges herself after she becomes visible. She has a potion of healing, which she uses if her current hit points drop to half her hit point maximum or lower.</p>

<p>Double stone doors lead into a barrel-vaulted area containing several furnaces. The eastern end of the chamber continues into a large, dark cave, from which a cold wind moans. A stream of water rushes from west to east through the center of the room, crossed by two stone bridges.

<p>Snurrevin has a familiar, a rat named Browngnaw, that hides in the shadows near the unlit forge to the east. The duergar are preoccupied with their task and don&rsquo;t notice the party&rsquo;s entrance unless the characters make themselves known. They object violently to intruders who aren&rsquo;t escorted by duergar.</p>
<p>If a threat becomes apparent, the two smiths grab their weapons, use Enlarge, and move to guard the two bridges. If the fight goes against them, they turn invisible and try to slip out to <strong>area 36</strong>, then join the other duergar in <strong>area 39</strong>.</p>
<p>In combat, Snurrevin might cast shocking grasp through his hidden familiar, and he might use silent image to confound enemies with realistic-seeming threats.</p>

<p>The stream running through the old dwarven bladeworks meanders through a natural cavern before tumbling into a great chasm. You can see nothing but darkness below, although the splashing of waters deep below is barely audible over the roar of the waterfall.</p>
<p>To the north of the chasm, a small ledge is partially hidden by a spur of rock.</p>

<p>The chasm is 120 feet deep. Anyone who falls in takes 42 (12d6) bludgeoning damage and ends up in <strong>area 50</strong> of the Black Lake level.

Durgeddin&rsquo;s Quarters</h2><p>Durgeddin led a spartan lifestyle, eschewing rich decorations and treasures in his personal quarters. Nimira has appropriated the room for her own use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room appears to be a bedchamber. In one corner to the south stands a large wooden sleeping platform, badly gouged by axe blows and partially burned. A table, a bench, and a writing desk have been similarly treated. In the middle of the southern wall, a space has been cleared for a simple sleeping pallet and a pair of large satchels. Two doors exit the room to the north.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the party enters the room through the secret door in the closet (see below), or if the characters avoided or quietly dealt with the guard in <strong>area 39</strong>, Nimira is here, resting on the pallet. Otherwise, the room is empty. The satchels contain mundane supplies: extra clothes, food, lamp oil, and similar stuff.</p>
<p>The door in the northwest corner leads to a bathing area, fitted with two small clay tanks to hold wash water. The northeast door opens into a closet containing the mildewed remnants of several cloaks.</p>

<p>The stairs leading south from the pillared hall end at a wooden door. Beyond is a corridor that opens up into a large room lined with hearths. This room must once have served as the kitchen: pots, pans, cauldrons, and kettles lie scattered on the floor and strewn across several tables. An archway to the west leads into a pantry filled with rotted foodstuffs. Suddenly, you hear a scraping sound, and a big wooden table shudders and begins to move, heading right for you!</p>

Driven insane with grief, he tried to repair some of the complex&rsquo;s defenses, animating dead warriors and various objects to kill any intruders that returned. In his madness, he even summoned a fiend (see <strong>area 49</strong>), and he perished at its hands not long after.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chamber must once have been the personal quarters of an important dwarf. It is decorated with tapestries and furnished comfortably, although age has taken its toll on the contents.

But the fiend easily over powered Arundil&rsquo;s will, then toyed with him cruelly until it finally drained his life force.</p>
<p>The succubus, which calls itself Idalla, claimed the scholar&rsquo;s library for its own and spends much time here reading through the collected lore. It learned of Khundrukar&rsquo;s history from the scholar&rsquo;s records and realized that the legends of wondrous treasure would lure greedy souls. It consumed the wizard from the previous expedition, who took refuge in this library after his companions were killed. Since that time, it has spread rumors to draw more adventurers to its lair.</p>
<p>Idalla takes the form of a human woman. When the characters enter, the fiend jumps up and begs to be released from imprisonment. Idalla tells the characters that she is a captive of a wizard who resides below this level. The succubus plays the role to the hilt, trembling and crying as it spins a tale of woe. It tries to split up the group, persuading one character to remain (using its Charm attack if necessary) while the others deal with the wizard. If they leave anyone alone with Idalla, the fiend attempts to kiss and drain the hapless dupe. The succubus is an adept liar and mixes in just enough of the truth to be convincing; see the &ldquo;Idalla&rsquo;s Story&rdquo; below.</p>
<p>If the characters attack, Idalla attempts to charm the most dangerous-looking character and turn him or her against the party while the fiend fades into the Ethereal.</p>

The fiend can impart the following bits of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wizard lives below this area. He wants to use Idalla for a study on prolonging life. (False.)</li>
<li>The wizard told Idalla a bit of the history of Khundrukar and the fate of Durgeddin, which she can pass on. (The information is true, but the succubus learned history from reading the books here, not from the wizard.)</li>
<li>A doppelganger lurks in the Glitterhame. (False.)</li>
<li>A dead dwarf haunts the halls, reduced to a mad, gibbering spirit. (True; this is the ghost of Arundil.)</li>
<li>An ancient dragon lairs below the Foundry. (Partly true; Nightscale is a young dragon.)</li>
</ul>

In the library, in addition to an extensive collection of dwarven lore, the characters can find four spell scrolls (of <wc-fetch type=spell>alarm</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>disguise self</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>enlarge/reduce</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=spell>shield</wc-fetch>). The shelves might also include more scrolls, useful information tying in to future adventures, items of value to a collector, or other interesting lore, as you see fit.</p>
