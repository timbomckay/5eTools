<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Welcome to <em>Tales from the Yawning Portal</em>. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.</p>
<p>Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.</p>
<ul>
<li>A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul&rsquo;s passing.</li>
<li>A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.</li>
<li>A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of FaerÃ»n and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.</p>
<p>The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D&rsquo;s deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.</p>

<p>The introduction of each adventure provides ideas on adapting it to a variety of D&D settings. Use that information to place it in your campaign or to give you an idea of how to adapt it.</p>
<p>These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as <em>Storm King&rsquo;s Thunder</em>, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.</p>

Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.</p>
<p>Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It&rsquo;s also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.</p>

Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, <em>The Forge of Fury</em> is tailored to provide increasingly tougher threats as the characters make their way through the fortress. Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th level-seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.</p>

Leason, made its debut under the title <em>Lost Tamoachan</em> at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.</p>
<p>The updated version of the adventure presented herein is designed for a group of four or five 5th-level player characters.</p>

Not only did he get the job, but <em>White Plume</em> became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.</p>
<p>The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.</p>

In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to <em>Tomb of Horrors, Ruins of Undermountain</em>, and other &ldquo;killer dungeons&rdquo; throughout the history of the game.</p>
<p>The version of <em>Dead in Thay</em> presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.</p>

Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.</p>
<p>The compilation of <em>Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl</em>, and <em>Hall of the Fire Giant King</em> was published in 1981 as <em>Against the Giants</em>. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.</p>

<p>The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax&rsquo;s personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of <em>Tomb of Horrors</em>, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.</p>
<p>As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game&rsquo;s cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D&rsquo;s greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime</p>

Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you&rsquo;re well prepared before the action starts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Monster Manual</em> contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster&rsquo;s name appears in <strong>bold</strong> type, that&rsquo;s a visual cue pointing you to the creature&rsquo;s stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure&rsquo;s text tells you so.</p>
<p>Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment mentioned in the book are described in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>. Magic items are described in the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>, unless the adventure&rsquo;s text directs you to an item&rsquo;s description in appendix A.</p>

With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.</p>
<p>Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.</p>
<p>The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character&rsquo;s background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.</p>

Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.</p>
<p>In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.</p>
<p>For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne&rsquo;er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.</p>
<p>Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he&rsquo;d never left.</p>
<p>Adventurers from across FaerÃ»n, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don&rsquo;t survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.</p>

In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.</p>

The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The &ldquo;well&rdquo; is all that remains of Halaster&rsquo;s tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.</p>
<p>Balconies on the tavern&rsquo;s second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.</p>

The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.</p>

Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan&rsquo;s fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.</p>

On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd&rsquo;s encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.</p>
<p>Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.</p>

Blessed with a seemingly limitless life span by treasures he brought back from his expedition nearly two centuries ago, he is as much a fixture in the tap room as the well.</p>
<p>Durnan is a man of few words. He expects to be paid for his time, and will offer insight and rumors only in return for hard cash. &ldquo;We know the odds and take our chances,&rdquo; he says, whether he is breaking up a card game that has turned violent or refusing the pleas of adventurers trapped at the bottom of the well who are unable to pay for a ride up. Despite his stony heart, he is an excellent source of information about Undermountain and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.</p>

They plundered the dwarves' ancestral halls and slew all they could catch. Fleeing his enemies, Durgeddin led the destitute remnants of his clan in search of a new home. After years of wandering, the dwarves discovered a great cavern system beneath the Stone Tooth: a rugged, forested hill crowned by a bare rocky crag. There Durgeddin and his followers founded the stronghold of Khundrukar.</p>
<p>About a century ago, a member of Durgeddin&rsquo;s clan was captured by a powerful orc tribe during a raid, and the orcs learned of their enemy&rsquo;s hidden stronghold. The orc chieftains raised a great army and marched on Khundrukar. In a hard-fought siege lasting months, the orcs tunneled around the dwarven defenses. When they finally stormed the place, they put all within to the sword, then carried off wagonloads of booty.</p>
<p>In the years since the great battle, various creatures have occupied the stronghold and used the place as a base for their raids. At other times, the caverns have lain empty except for the mindless and bloodthirsty monsters that haunt such places. Today legends of Durgeddin&rsquo;s Vengeance (or the Smith&rsquo;s War) and the extraordinary blades the dwarves forged in anger still surface from time to time in the lands near the Stone Tooth.</p>

It is designed for four 3rd-level player characters. They can advance to 5th level with good play.</p>
<p>The characters come to the Stone Tooth in search of a reputed cache of Durgeddin&rsquo;s superior blades and find the stronghold inhabited by dangerous monsters. The complex consists of the following five sections:</p>

It is currently inhabited by a tribe of fierce orcs, led by a brutal ogre known as Great Ulfe.</p>
<h4 id=the-glitterhame>
<a href=#the-glitterhame class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Glitterhame</h4><p>The largest level of Khundrukar, the Glitterhame is an expanse of beautiful natural caverns now infested by troglodytes and other cave-dwelling monsters.</p>
<h4 id=the-sinkhole>
<a href=#the-sinkhole class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Sinkhole</h4><p>Streams in the Glitterhame descend to an underground river, which runs through a corner of the caverns forgotten by the denizens above.</p>
<h4 id=the-foundry>
<a href=#the-foundry class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Foundry</h4><p>Beyond the Glitterhame lies a complex of chambers and passageways carved by Durgeddin&rsquo;s folk. A small band of duergar (gray dwarves) currently hold Durgeddin&rsquo;s hall, working to uncover the secrets of the smith&rsquo;s ancient forge. A great crevasse drops to the Black Lake.</p>
<h4 id=the-black-lake>
<a href=#the-black-lake class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Black Lake</h4><p>The most dangerous denizen of the caverns under the Stone Tooth lairs in the cold, still waters of the Black Lake. Nightscale, a young black dragon, discovered a passage into the lake through an underwater siphon connecting to a mere on the far side of the hill. The dragon has claimed the ancient wealth of Khundrukar as her hoard.</p>

<p>The town of Blasingdell is briefly described in this adventure, if you need a location where the characters can make their final preparations.</p>
<p>Your next task is to decide how the party learned about Khundrukar. Pick one of the following options that suits your campaign, or make up an explanation.</p>
<h4 id=follow-the-map>
<a href=#follow-the-map class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Follow the Map</h4><p>The party has acquired a map showing the location of a secret dwarven stronghold named Khundrukar. Perhaps the characters discovered the map and other lore about the place during a previous adventure, or it turned up in a forgotten corner of a library. Tales attributed to a previous, failed expedition make reference to a hoard of wondrous arms and armor.</p>
<h4 id=track-the-broken-blade>
<a href=#track-the-broken-blade class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Track the Broken Blade</h4><p>Baron Althon, a local noble, hires the party to search for the legendary cache of weapons forged by Durgeddin the smith. He shows the characters a broken blade bearing the smith&rsquo;s mark, and tells them that it was discovered near a rocky hill called the Stone Tooth. Baron Althon provides directions and promises to reward the characters richly for each of Durgeddin&rsquo;s blades they recover. He will pay the characters 20 gp each just for bringing back information about the dwarven complex, and an additional 100 gp if they provide detailed maps.</p>

The local militia captured an orc warrior left for dead by its comrades and brought it back for questioning. Under the influence of a <wc-fetch type=spell>charm person</wc-fetch> spell, the orc divulged the location of the monsters' lair, a lonely hill called the Stone Tooth. The mayor offers a bounty of 25 gp per orc, dead or alive, and the gratitude of the townsfolk to any who can permanently end the threat.</p>

Although it isn&rsquo;t close enough for the characters to use as an overnight rest stop while they explore Khundrukar, Blasingdell is still useful as a place to purchase equipment, stock up on supplies, and train between excursions into the caverns.</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s population of around 2,000 is quite diverse; although humans are the largest group, almost any player character race can be found here.</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s mayor is <strong>Sir Miles Berrick</strong> (male human noble).</p>
<p><strong>Sergeant Grendar Kuln</strong> (male half-orc veteran) is in charge of the town watch; <strong>Constable Dara Whitewood</strong> (female human veteran) is the senior officer. The town watch consists of two full-time guards in addition to its officers. A militia force of around 100 commoners can be mustered in emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>Kheldegan Tolm</strong> (male dwarf commoner) owns Tolm&rsquo;s Superior Outfitting and Dry Goods.</p>
<p><strong>Sarel Bankdown</strong> (female half-elf commoner) is the proprietor of the Griffon&rsquo;s Nest inn and tavern.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Alonsa</strong> (female human priest) heads up the town&rsquo;s small temple (its primary deity is left to you). Sister Alonsa is assisted in her duties by two acolytes.</p>

<p><strong>Dragonlance:</strong> On Krynn, Khundrukar can be placed anywhere in the Kharolis Mountains. An independent stronghold that has no direct tunnels connecting it to Thorbardin, it was overrun by attackers during the Age of Might. During the Age of Despair, it was seized by Highlord Verminaard&rsquo;s forces. Consider replacing the orcs in the adventure with hobgoblins and the duergar with Theiwar dwarves.</p>
<p><strong>Eberron:</strong> Once an outpost in the western Mror Holds, Khundrukar was besieged and cleared of its inhabitants when the Kingdom of Galifar invaded that land. The aggressors left the place unoccupied after their victory. Since then, it has fallen into the hands of various groups of monsters.</p>
<p><strong>Forgotten Realms:</strong> Located northwest of Mirabar in the Spine of the World, Khundrukar was a shield dwarf stronghold that became overrun by renegade orcs from the Many-Arrows tribe, unhappy with what they saw as their kingdom&rsquo;s betrayal of the old ways.</p>
<p><strong>Greyhawk:</strong> Khundrukar stands in the Pomarj, in the western Drachensgrab Hills. The fortress fell shortly after the Hateful Wars, when a wave of orcs and other evil humanoid invaders swept over the region.</p>
