<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Before the dissolution of the ordning, the influence of the storm giants was so great that lesser giants were compelled to abide by their decrees. The storm giants, reclusive by nature, did their best to discourage lesser giants from destroying the civilizations of the small folk. The death of Queen Neri and the disappearance of King Hekaton have left Maelstrom in disarray, allowing evil giants to run rampant.</p>

</p>
<p>King Hekaton saw signs that his eldest daughters were unfit to claim the <wc-fetch type=item>Wyrmskull Throne</wc-fetch>, so he made his even-keeled youngest daughter, Serissa, his rightful heir. She has taken her place on the <wc-fetch type=item>Wyrmskull Throne</wc-fetch>, but with the ordning shattered, she doesn&rsquo;t have the power to keep the evil giant lords in line. She relies on two storm giants for counsel: her uncle, Uthor (Hekaton&rsquo;s younger brother), and the wise, matronly Iymrith. Unfortunately, neither of them has much respect for small folk. In that regard, Serissa is alone. Like her dearly departed mother, Serissa believes that small folk are cleverer and mightier than most giants give them credit for, and as a child, she visited their shores in the company of her mother and has great affection for them.</p>
<p>In this part of their mission, the characters use their <wc-fetch type=item>conch of teleportation</wc-fetch> (obtained in a previous chapter) to teleport to Maelstrom. Once there, they must make their way to Princess Serissa and win her confidence. She wants to believe that her father is alive. She also wants to believe that the characters are resourceful and strong enough to find and rescue King Hekaton, despite what Uthor and Iymrith whisper. If the characters convince Serissa that they can help, she shows them a clue found near the corpse of her mother: a wooden coin that leads the characters into conflict with the Kraken Society (as discussed in chapter 11, &ldquo;Caught in the Tentacles&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Standing in the characters' way are Serissa&rsquo;s siblings, Mirran and Nym, who do everything in their power to turn Serissa against the adventurers and prove to their younger sibling that small folk can&rsquo;t be trusted and must be wiped out. The characters also encounter Iymrith again. To prove their true worth to the storm giants, the characters must expose the dragon who hides in their midst. The dragon flees when her true nature is revealed, and the characters don&rsquo;t encounter Iymrith again until they confront her in her desert lair (see chapter 12).</p>
<p>Characters who have no interest in intrigue might try to plunder the stronghold or do away with members of the royal family. Any such act turns Serissa against the characters and plays right into Iymrith&rsquo;s hands.</p>

For centuries, it has been the stronghold of the world&rsquo;s most powerful storm giant kings. The undersea fortress of King Hekaton is carved into a reef. Four rocky towers covered in barnacles and coral reach upward, and between them is a large sinkhole that descends into the heart of the fortress. A natural phenomenon sometimes causes the ocean currents to form a great whirlpool with enough strength to draw ships down into it. These vessels are torn apart as they are pulled down, and the wreckage is deposited at the bottom of the sinkhole, where hulking crabs pick through it for their storm giant masters.</p>
<h3 id=reaching-maelstrom>
<a href=#reaching-maelstrom class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Reaching Maelstrom</h3><p>The easiest and safest way to reach Maelstrom (shown on maps 10.1 and 10.2) is with teleportation magic, and characters should have a <wc-fetch type=item>conch of teleportation</wc-fetch> when the time comes to visit the storm giant stronghold. Characters who teleport to Maelstrom using the conch appear atop the magical glyph in <strong>area 2</strong>.</p>
<p>Characters can also reach Maelstrom by ship. Maelstrom is located on the sea floor between Ruathym, the Whalebones, and the Korinn Archipelago. Any ship that sails over Maelstrom encounters a giant whirlpool, which inexorably draws the vessel into the depths. The ship&rsquo;s hull is torn apart, its wreckage sucked to the bottom of a sinkhole in the heart of the stronghold (<strong>area 1</strong>). Creatures aboard the vessel must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (<wc-roll>10d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. There&rsquo;s no air in the sinkhole, so characters who survive the shipwreck must hold their breath, locate an air pocket, or use magic to breathe. Characters who are drawn down into the depths must also contend with water pressure.</p>
<h4 id=water-pressure>
<a href=#water-pressure class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Water Pressure</h4><p>Creatures and vehicles at Maelstrom&rsquo;s depth take 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage per minute from water pressure unless they are adapted or built to withstand this environment. Storm giants, whales, sharks, crustaceans, and aquatic invertebrates are immune to water pressure at this depth, as are vehicles with a damage threshold of 10 or higher. Other creatures might be immune to the effect of water pressure, at your discretion.</p>
<p>A spell that allows one to breathe underwater provides no protection against the crushing effect of water pressure unless the spell&rsquo;s description says otherwise. Even an <wc-fetch type=item>apparatus of Kwalish</wc-fetch> isn&rsquo;t designed to withstand water pressure at this depth. Creatures inside an <wc-fetch type=item>apparatus of Kwalish</wc-fetch> are protected from the crushing effect of the pressure while the apparatus has at least 1 hit point.</p>

<p>Princess Serissa is the supreme authority in Maelstrom during her father&rsquo;s absence. She entrusts her uncle, Uthor, with command of the garrison. If the stronghold is attacked, Uthor&rsquo;s primary duty is to protect the princesses, Serissa first and foremost. All other storm giants-the princesses included-obey Uthor&rsquo;s commands when it comes to military matters.</p>
<p>Once Iymrith realizes that small folk have invaded the stronghold, she does everything she can to foment a war. She tries to convince Serissa that the adventurers are assassins sent to kill her (&ldquo;hired by the villainous Lords' Alliance, no less,&rdquo; Iymrith supposes), and that every word spilling from their mouths is a lie. As a last resort, Iymrith will goad Mirran and Nym into attacking the adventurers, since she knows that Uthor and his guards will quickly turn on anyone who harms his nieces. Iymrith won&rsquo;t attack the adventurers herself. If her true nature is revealed, she tries to snatch the Korolnor Scepter from Serissa&rsquo;s clutches before fleeing the stronghold and returning to her lair in Anauroch (see chapter 12, &ldquo;Doom of the Desert&rdquo;).</p>

The general features of the undersea stronghold are summarized here.</p>
<p><strong>Air-Filled and Submerged Areas:</strong> Many chambers and corridors are filled with air that is continuously and magically replenished. On the map, air-filled areas are tinted purple. Some air-filled areas contain pools of water; a pool fills a depression in the floor and is tinted blue on the map. Submerged areas are tinted blue from wall to wall. Characters who can&rsquo;t breathe underwater must hold their breath in a submerged area. While submerged, they are also susceptible to the effect of water pressure (see the &ldquo;Water Pressure&rdquo; section). Rules for underwater combat appear in the &ldquo;Underwater Combat&rdquo; section in chapter 9 of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Anemone Chests:</strong> The storm giants cultivate 10-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide anemones that can survive out of the water and have hollow cavities within them. The giants use the anemones as treasure chests and for waste disposal. Edible organic matter placed in an anemone chest is slowly digested over a period of days; inedible or inorganic matter is not.</p>
<p>When a storm giant touches one of these anemones, it opens at the top. Any other creature that comes into contact with an anemone must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) poison damage from the anemone&rsquo;s poisonous tendrils. A character can trick an anemone into opening by touching it and succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. If the check fails, the anemone doesn&rsquo;t open, and the character must make the saving throw. A chest remains open for 1 minute, then closes. An anemone chest has AC 5 and 20 hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Ceilings:</strong> Ceilings throughout the fortress are 50 feet high in air-filled areas and 30 feet high in submerged areas unless otherwise noted. The sinkhole in the middle of the fortress is open to the sea above.</p>
<p><strong>Climbing:</strong> The stronghold has slick, rough-hewn walls that don&rsquo;t offer a lot of handholds, so climbing them without gear requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal Windows:</strong> Some rooms have oval windows made of thick, transparent crystal. These windows were designed to withstand tremendous amounts of pressure and force, and aren&rsquo;t easily broken. Each window has AC 15, 60 hit points, a damage threshold of 20, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Breaking a window causes seawater to pour into the stronghold, flooding air-filled chambers and lower levels quickly. Doing this has no effect on storm giants, who can breathe water as easily as they breathe air, but creatures that can&rsquo;t breathe water aren&rsquo;t likely to survive for long without the aid of water breathing spells or similar magic.</p>
<p><strong>Doors and Secret Doors:</strong> The giant-sized doors throughout Maelstrom are 30 feet tall and made of barnacle-covered stone with rusty iron hinges. Their handles are 13 feet above the floor. Secret doors are similar in size but lack visible hinges and handles. A Huge giant has no trouble opening either type of door. A smaller creature can attempt to open a door if that creature or some other helpful creature can reach the door&rsquo;s handle and unlatch it. While the handle is unlatched, a creature must use an action to push or pull on the heavy door, opening it with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed check, the door doesn&rsquo;t open. The doors aren&rsquo;t airtight and can&rsquo;t hold back water.</p>
<p>Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher spot a secret door as they move near its location. A character can also find it by searching for secret doors and succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p><strong>Giant Clams:</strong> Giant clams appear in several of the stronghold&rsquo;s chambers. As an action, a character can pry open a giant clam with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check. Using a crowbar, a sword, or a similar tool grants advantage on the check. When a giant clam is opened, roll on the Giant Clam table to determine its contents.</p>

<p><strong>Illumination:</strong> All interior spaces are dimly lit. Air-filled chambers have wall sconces with continual flame spells cast on them or oval windows of transparent crystal that allow light from the bioluminescent coral reef to enter. Bioluminescent fish dimly illuminate submerged areas.</p>
<p><strong>Oversized Furnishings and Objects:</strong> Most of the furnishings and other items in Maelstrom are sized for storm giants. Exceptions are noted in the text. Tables, chairs, and other room fixtures are typically three times as high, long, and wide as their human-sized equivalents and roughly twenty-seven times the weight. Small and Medium creatures can scuttle under and clamber over giant-sized furniture, treating the spaces they occupy as difficult terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Portcullises:</strong> Throughout the stronghold are iron portcullises covered in barnacles. A portcullis can be raised or lowered with a successful DC 26 Strength (Athletics) check. A Small creature can slip between the bars with ease, while a Medium creature can squeeze between the portcullis bars with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p>
<p><strong>Stairs:</strong> Staircases in the stronghold are sized for storm giants. Each step is 4 feet tall by 4 feet deep. Large and smaller creatures treat the staircases as difficult terrain.</p>

Vortex and Sinkhole</h2><p>A powerful vortex swirls above a 100-foot-deep, 180-foot-wide sinkhole on the ocean bottom. (On the surface of the water, the vortex manifests as a half-mile-wide whirlpool powerful enough to drag ships to their doom.) The sinkhole has a drain at the bottom. Plugging the drain would cause the vortex to dissipate, but the drain is 50 feet in diameter. A barnacle-covered iron grate covers the drain, and the holes between its bars are 10 feet wide. The sinkhole has three levels.</p>
<h3 id=level-1>

The walls are covered with coral and other ocean life. Five flooded passageways lead to areas 2, 5, 6, 8, and 11.</p>

A rocky, uneven ledge clings to the outer wall of the hole and has coral, plant life, and the bones of a wrecked ship atop it. Five flooded tunnels lead to areas 15, 19, 20, 21, and 29.</p>

From here, an observer on the ocean floor can just barely make out a circular ledge 50 feet down, while the bottom of the sinkhole is hidden in the gloom 100 feet below. Lying around the mouth of the sinkhole are more wrecked ships, and looming above are the four coral-covered underwater spires that serve as home to the royal family. The shipwrecks have been picked clean, and anyone who lingers in the area sees sharks, whales, crabs, and other creatures moving about. These aquatic creatures mind their own business and pay little heed to surface-dwellers.</p>
<p>The coral on the outside of the royal spires can be harvested and sold. Someone who can withstand the pressure at this depth (see the &ldquo;Water Pressure&rdquo; section earlier in this chapter) can harvest <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> pounds of coral in an hour. Each pound is worth 50 gp. The storm giants in <strong>area 34</strong> try to scare off anyone plundering the coral.</p>

Portal Chamber</h2><p>Anyone that teleports to Maelstrom appears atop a glowing glyph carved into the floor of an alcove in the north east corner of this rough-hewn chamber. This is true even if the destination was elsewhere in the stronghold.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</p>
<p>The moist walls here are covered with bioluminescent lichen, snails, starfish, and barnacles. Tiny, harmless crabs crawl across the floor, avoiding the sigil.</p>
<p>The first time the characters arrive in this chamber, they hear music: a powerful female voice accompanied by the deep, haunting tones of a masterfully played pipe organ. The music comes from within a spiral staircase that leads up to <strong>area 14</strong>. The two storm giants who normally stand guard at the foot of this staircase are currently in <strong>area 14</strong>, keeping an eye on some other visitors.</p>
<p>(See <strong>area 14</strong> for Treasure Parcels)</p>

Doors on the south wall of the corridor lead to <strong>area 3</strong>. Each door is made of ironbound oak, measures 15 feet tall by 7 feet wide, and has AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Neither door has a lock.</p>
<p>A similar hall stretches northward. The statue at the end of the north hall depicts a male storm giant blowing a pink and blue conch shell. Giant-sized doors to either side of the statue lead to more guest quarters (<strong>area 4</strong>).</p>

Every hour on the hour, a geyser of steam shoots up from a vent in the bottom of the shallow basin, sending out a loud hissing noise as it erupts. Any creature in the small, circular room when the geyser erupts is engulfed in scalding steam and boiling water, and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

They have covered their shells with ship wreckage, and they attack anything that enters their cave unless it looks like a storm giant. From a distance of 30 feet or more, the crabs are easily mistaken for piles of debris. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check recognizes the creatures for what they are.</p>

An enormous killer whale (144 hit points) swims circles in the pool, attacking any creature other than Nym that enters it. The whale is Nym&rsquo;s mount.</p>
<p>A submerged passage blocked by a lowered portcullis connects the whale&rsquo;s pool to the sinkhole (<strong>area 1</strong>). Crates of dead fish rest against the walls, and a spiral staircase ascends 120 feet to <strong>area 31</strong>.

Nym has turned this cave into her personal coral garden. Growths of coral sprout from walls and rock formations, all of them colorful and immense. One of the coral-covered rock formations is actually a roper, which Nym uses as a guardian. The roper attacks any creature other than Nym that crosses the room.</p>
<p>A character can harvest <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> pounds of coral in an hour. The coral here is worth 100 gp per pound. The garden holds 50,000 gp worth of coral.</p>

Staircases carved into the northwest and southeast walls lead down to areas 7 and 10. An open portcullis hangs above the southeast staircase. A third stairway leads up to <strong>area 9</strong>, and a wide spiral staircase ascends 120 feet to <strong>area 30</strong>. A crate of dead fish is near the spiral staircase. Halfway up it is a secret door that opens into <strong>area 20</strong>.</p>

When the whale sees another creature, it leaps out of the water and sings for its supper. If a character throws it a dead fish or some thing else it can eat, the whale remembers the gift and won&rsquo;t attack that individual unless the character attacks it first. The pool is connected to the sinkhole (<strong>area 1</strong>) by a flooded passage with a lowered portcullis.</p>

Study</h2><p>Serissa used to come here quite often to study in solitude, but her present duties permit her no opportunity to pursue her studies. An ugly bookshelf made from ship wreckage stands against one wall, packed full of tomes that Serissa recovered from wrecked ships. The books were written by &ldquo;small folk&rdquo; and are sized appropriately. The covers and pages of the books are wrinkled and stained by seawater, and the writing is often smeared and illegible, but Serissa has gleaned a lot of information about humans, halflings, and other small folk from perusing the tomes. Since the books are small by Serissa&rsquo;s standards, she uses a spyglass to read them. The spyglass rests on top of the 20-foot-tall bookshelf.</p>
<p>Other furnishings include two anemone chests and a table with a concave top made from a huge mussel shell.</p>

Great Hall</h2><p>Music fills this hall when the characters first arrive. The room is split into two levels; a 15-foot-high raised ledge hugs the walls to the north and east, and gently sloping ramps lead up to it. The acoustics here are excellent. Barnacle-covered pillars of hewn rock rise to meet the vaulted ceiling, and a huge crystal window allows in light that casts beautiful patterns on the walls.</p>

</span>
</p>
<p>Under the crystal window is a hulking crab with colored nodules and hollow flutes of beautiful coral growing out of its shell. This creature is a living instrument. When one of the nodules on its shell is tapped, the motion tickles the crab and causes it to exhale a burst of air through one of its coral pipes, producing a deep tone similar to that of a pipe organ. Any creature that has proficiency in the Performance skill can, with hours of practice, learn to play the crab organ.</p>

</p>
<p>Performing next to the ledge are King Hekaton&rsquo;s two eldest daughters, Mirran and Nym. Mirran is singing, while Nym provides instrumental accompaniment by tapping on the crab&rsquo;s shell with a pair of whalebone mallets. Mirran and Nym have the statistics of a storm giant, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mirran and Nym are neutral evil.</li>
<li>They are unarmed and unarmored (AC 12).</li>
<li>They have the following additional skills: Deception +9, Performance +9.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sisters are entertaining several high-ranking visitors: a cloud giant count named Vaal (neutral evil), a fire giant duchess named Tartha (lawful evil), a frost giant jarl named Hellenhild (neutral evil), and a stone giant thane named Braxow (neutral). These giant nobles have come to Maelstrom, using their own <wc-fetch type=item>conch of teleportation</wc-fetch>, to find out what Princess Serissa plans to do about the dissolution of the ordning, and to ascertain the extent of her power and influence. Each of them awaits an audience with the regent. The giant guests gather around mussel-shell tables and a giant coral fountain in the lower part of the room. The coral fountain spouts fresh water (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;), which the giants drink from their conch shells. The giant visitors know better than to start a fight in here. They have no interest in hearing what the &ldquo;small folk&rdquo; have to say.</p>
<p>Watching the visitors are two storm giant wearing helms. If Mirran and Nym are attacked, these royal guards rush to the princesses' defense and cover their retreat to the throne room (<strong>area 15</strong>). The visiting giants join the battle on the side of the storm giants to avoid incurring the royal family&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>A 40-foot-wide hall leading south ends at a guarded set of doors that open into the throne room.</p>

The guards quickly interpose themselves between the princesses and the new arrivals, but Mirran orders the guards to stand down so that she and Nym can learn &ldquo;what brings these puny creatures to court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the characters make demands, Mirran is enraged by their insolence, while Nym gives them a cold, condescending smile. Neither sister is of a mind to facilitate a meeting between Serissa and a motley group of &ldquo;small folk.&rdquo; If the characters are diplomatic, Mirran and Nym tell them that their young, inexperienced sister is &ldquo;far too overwhelmed with important matters&rdquo; to grant the characters an audience at this moment. Mirran instructs the two storm giant guards to escort the adventurers to the guest quarters (<strong>area 3</strong>), where they are to remain until summoned. If the characters allow themselves to be taken to <strong>area 3</strong>, the storm giants stand guard in <strong>area 2</strong> to make sure they don&rsquo;t wander.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after a private discussion, Mirran and Nym decide that the adventurers must be eliminated. Nym goes to inform Serissa that assassins have breached Maelstrom&rsquo;s defenses. At the same time, Mirran confronts the adventurers in <strong>area 3</strong>, tells them that their request for an audience with Serissa has been granted, and leads them into <strong>area 2</strong>, where Vaal, Tartha, Hellenhild, and Braxow wait to attack them (see &ldquo;Dealing with the Giant Lords&rdquo;). The storm giant guards cover Mirran&rsquo;s escape to <strong>area 15</strong>.</p>
<p>Mirran and Nym do everything possible to avoid getting entangled in melee, and they don&rsquo;t hesitate to turn on each other to save themselves. Neither knows that Iymrith is a blue dragon in disguise. If Iymrith&rsquo;s true nature is exposed, each sister blames the other for colluding with a dragon. Each feigns innocence while blaming the other for conspiring with Iymrith to murder their mother and dispose of their father.</p>
<p>If things go badly and the sisters have nowhere else to go, Mirran retreats to her quarters (<strong>area 30</strong>), refusing to abandon the stronghold she believes is rightfully hers, while Nym retreats to <strong>area 6</strong> and wisely tries to flee Maelstrom on the back of her pet killer whale.</p>

Nevertheless, a character can attempt to shift a giant lord&rsquo;s attitude toward the party from hostile to indifferent by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A character can use an action to attempt to sway one giant lord. A failed check can&rsquo;t be retried against the same giant lord until 24 hours have passed. The character gains advantage on the check under the following conditions.</p>

She commands Uthor to marshal all of Maelstrom&rsquo;s defenses and destroy the adventurers. Serissa also realizes that her faith in the small folk has been misplaced. In effect, the killing of Mirran or Nym gives Iymrith a major victory, so far as the act drives a wedge between giants and the small folk.</p>
<p>To win Serissa&rsquo;s trust, the characters might try to convince her that Mirran and Nym are complicit in the assassination of their mother and the abduction of their father. Without evidence or a confession from one or both evil sisters, a character must make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Serissa that one or both of her sisters should be placed under house arrest pending a full investigation. Award advantage on the check if the characters disclose that they learned of Mirran and Nym&rsquo;s treachery from the Eye of Annam-a source that both Serissa and Uthor trust. If the check succeeds, Serissa views the arrest of her sisters as a sensible precaution. On Serissa&rsquo;s orders, Uthor has Mirran and Nym confined to their towers (areas 30 and 31, respectively), with a storm giant guard placed at the top of each staircase to make sure the sisters don&rsquo;t leave. Each evil sister professes her innocence while proclaiming the other&rsquo;s treachery. If the character&rsquo;s Charisma (Persuasion) check fails, Serissa takes no action against her sisters. The check can be repeated, but only if new and relevant information is brought to Serissa&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p>Characters can outwit the hill giants by concocting a believable lie, such as &ldquo;We are spies for Princess Serissa, come to deliver important information about her father!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Princess Serissa told you that we were coming, or have you forgotten?&rdquo; Have the liar make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the giants' Wisdom (Insight) check. (Roll once for both giants.) If the character wins the contest, Tug and Cog exchange glassy-eyed looks, shrug, open the doors, and allow the characters to enter the throne room.

Stone bleachers overlook an oblong chamber with a 50-foot-deep pool of seawater near its center. In the middle of the bleachers is an archway with two doors in it. A submerged passageway that leads from the bottom of the pool to the sinkhole (<strong>area 1</strong>) is designed to serve as an escape route. At the far end of the passageway is a lowered portcullis that bars access to the sinkhole.</p>
<p>Facing the pool and the doors are three enormous thrones. The middle one is carved from a solid chunk of obsidian, has four blue dragon skulls affixed to its base, and floats 1 foot above the floor. Characters who succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (History) check recognize this object as the <wc-fetch type=item>Wyrmskull Throne</wc-fetch>.

When she was a child, her mother would take her on trips to the Sword Coast and the Moonshae Isles, where they met small folk who were generous and kind. Serissa thinks that giants and small folk can learn to coexist peacefully, though Iymrith and Uthor would have her believe otherwise.</p>
<p>Serissa is mourning the death of her mother. Queen Neri&rsquo;s body was recovered from a cluster of islands that humans refer to as the Red Rocks. One of the storm giants who found the queen also found a wooden coin painted with a golden goose insignia and gave it to Serissa, thinking it belonged to her mother. Serissa hasn&rsquo;t told anyone about the coin. She doesn&rsquo;t know what it represents and hopes to find someone who does.</p>
<p>If the characters gain an audience with Serissa, she is patient and listens intently to what they have to say. If the characters express interest in bringing an end to the unrest in giant society, she hands them the wooden coin and asks them to find out where it came from. She believes that the people who murdered her mother might have also kidnapped her father, and the wooden coin is her only clue to his whereabouts. If the characters accept Serissa&rsquo;s quest, she leads them to the meditation cave (<strong>area 18</strong>) and uses its teleport power to transport them back to the mainland (or wherever else they wish to go). She also allows them to keep the wooden coin. The significance of the coin is revealed in chapter 11, &ldquo;Caught in the Tentacles.&rdquo; If the characters agree to go hunting for Hekaton, Serissa suggests that they take their <wc-fetch type=item>conch of teleportation</wc-fetch> with them so that they can return to Maelstrom safely. If the characters no longer have their conch for some reason, Serissa furnishes them with another one (taken from one of her guests).</p>

<p>If the characters attack Serissa, she uses the powers of the <wc-fetch type=item>Wyrmskull Throne</wc-fetch> against them. If they make allegations against her sisters, Serissa reacts as described in the &ldquo;Development&rdquo; section in <strong>area 14</strong>.</p>

Iymrith tries to squash any alliance between the storm giants and the small folk by telling Serissa that the adventurers can&rsquo;t be trusted, adding hastily,</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Iymrith realizes almost instantly that she has chosen those words poorly, for how could she know that Hekaton has been abducted? If the players fail to pick up on her self-incriminating words, have Serissa and all characters present make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. Those who succeed on the check realize that Iymrith knows more than she&rsquo;s letting on.</p>
<p>If the characters accuse Iymrith of being a dragon in disguise, she expresses outrage at the accusation and tries to convince Serissa that this claim is a ploy to sow discord in the storm giants' court. Heedless of Iymrith&rsquo;s words, Serissa is inclined to give the characters the benefit of the doubt. When it becomes clear to Iymrith that Serissa&rsquo;s fondness for small folk can&rsquo;t be undone with mere words, the dragon begins plotting her exit strategy.</p>
<p>Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on Iymrith doesn&rsquo;t reveal her true form, but contact with an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> causes her to revert to her dragon form. It&rsquo;s unlikely that characters will have access to such powerful magic, but if all else fails, they can simply attack her. Iymrith doesn&rsquo;t revert to dragon form in this encounter. On her first turn in combat, she curses the characters in Draconic, declares that all giants and small folk are doomed, and snatches the <wc-fetch type=item>Korolnor Scepter</wc-fetch> from around Serissa&rsquo;s neck. On her next turn, she teleports away. If she is unable to cast her <wc-fetch type=spell>teleport</wc-fetch> spell for some reason, she flees through the circular pool in the floor and swims out of the strong hold to the surface. (As long as she remains in storm giant form, Iymrith can breathe underwater.) If Serissa is seated on the <wc-fetch type=item>Wyrmskull Throne</wc-fetch> when the scepter is stolen from her, Serissa is paralyzed (see the throne&rsquo;s description in appendix B for details).</p>
<p>If the characters do nothing to force Iymrith&rsquo;s hand, she allows them to leave and pursue Serissa&rsquo;s quest, convinced that they will never find King Hekaton. At the same time, Serissa&rsquo;s confidence in the characters' abilities sows doubt in Iymrith&rsquo;s mind (see &ldquo;Development&rdquo;).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the characters might come into possession of a <wc-fetch type=item>Spell Scroll (7th level)</wc-fetch> <wc-fetch type=spell>resurrection</wc-fetch> at some point in the adventure, in which case they could offer to cast the spell on Queen Neri and bring her back from the dead. If they make such an offer, Serissa leads them to her mother&rsquo;s sunken tomb (<strong>area 22</strong>) or has the queen&rsquo;s body brought to them. If Neri is returned to life, she replaces Iymrith as Serissa&rsquo;s advisor, and Serissa rewards the characters by giving them the magic items in the sea chest in the royal treasury (<strong>area 16</strong>). Queen Neri, like Serissa, has a fondness for the small folk, and she&rsquo;s just as eager to find out what happened to Hekaton.</p>

Royal Treasury</h2><p>Thirty-four rusty anchors dangle from iron chains bolted to the 50-foot-high ceiling of this room, one above each full 10-foot square. The storm giants salvaged the anchors from wrecked ships and transported them here. Each anchor weighs roughly 3,000 pounds and is suspended 40 feet above the floor. Two of these dangling anchors are part of a trap (see &ldquo;Trap&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The room holds three crates, two barrels, a massive sea chest, and two anemone chests.</p>

The pressure plate fills two 10-foot squares (each marked T on the map). Anyone who searches the floor for traps before entering the room spots the pressure plate with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. Applying 250 pounds or more to the plate causes the anchor above each trapped square to drop, chain and all. Any creature in a trapped space must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by the falling anchor for 44 (<wc-roll>8d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage. One minute after the trap triggers, a mechanism hidden in the walls and ceiling causes the iron chains to retract, pulling the anchors back up, whereupon the trap resets. As an action, a character can disable the pressure plate (by driving a wedge or iron spike into its seam to prevent the plate from moving), doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.</p>

The second crate holds an <wc-fetch type=item>apparatus of Kwalish</wc-fetch> that was recovered from the pressurized hold of a wrecked gnomish submarine. The third crate contains hundreds of trinkets recovered from the sea floor-tribute from various sea elf tribes that pledge fealty to the storm giant king. The trinkets include everything from worthless baubles to fine statuary and jewelry plundered from shipwrecks. The total weight of this tribute is 100 pounds, and its total value is 10,000 gp.</p>
<p>The two barrels are full of exquisite wine (worth 2,500 gp each) and weigh 2,500 pounds each.</p>
<p>The sea chest is 12 feet long, 9 feet tall, and 9 feet deep, with a lid shaped like a half-barrel. The large padlock that hangs from its latch is too big to be picked using thieves' tools. A Small character can squeeze inside the locking mechanism and pick the lock with a successful DC 16 Dexterity check. Lifting the heavy lid requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. The chest holds a dozen smaller (human-made) chests that are unlocked and contain booty retrieved from the sea floor. Each small chest has <wc-roll>3d6 Ã 100</wc-roll> gp in mixed coinage. Lying among the chests are <wc-roll>1d4+1</wc-roll> magic items. Roll on Magic Item Table H in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em> for the first two items and on Table F for any other items.</p>
<p>The first anemone chest holds six grapefruit-sized pink pearls (worth 500 gp each). The second anemone chest contains six <wc-fetch type=item>potion of giant size</wc-fetch> in purple and green coral vials sized for Small and Medium creatures. Each coral vial is worth 25 gp.</p>

Meditation Cave</h2><p>This naturally formed cave has bioluminescent lichen, coral, snails, and starfish clinging to its damp walls. The area radiates overlapping auras of conjuration, divination, and evocation magic when scrutinized with a detect magic spell. Over the years, the storm giants have learned how to become attuned to the magic of this cave and harness its innate magical properties.</p>
<p>Becoming attuned to the cave requires a creature to spend a short rest meditating inside the cave. While meditating, the creature can&rsquo;t engage in any strenuous activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature becomes aware of the cave&rsquo;s magical properties and can use them as described here.</p>
<p>Only one creature can be attuned to the cave at a time. A creature&rsquo;s attunement to the cave ends as soon as it leaves the cave. A creature that is attuned to the cave can use an action to cast one of the following spells, requiring no material components: <wc-fetch type=spell>clairvoyance</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type=spell>teleport</wc-fetch>.</p>

The walls of this temple are etched with images of storm giants riding whales, battling dragon turtles, and blowing conch shells to summon giant crabs, giant octopi, manta rays, and schools of fish. Harmless star fish and sea urchins cling to the walls and congregate around the base of the statue.</p>
<p>Characters who examine the statue and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can see marks on the rough floor, suggesting that the statue has recently been moved aside. It takes a creature as big and strong as a storm giant to slide the statue, but the characters can use ropes to pull it over with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check. Doing this breaks the statue and reveals a flooded, 15-foot-wide shaft that descends for 30 feet, then bends to the west and leads to Queen Neri&rsquo;s sunken tomb (<strong>area 22</strong>).</p>

<p>Arrayed along the walls are ten upright stone sarcophagi, their barnacle-covered lids sculpted to look like regal storm giants.

These rocks also record fables that are meant to be passed down from one generation to the next, including cautionary tales about the fall of ancient Ostoria and accounts of the giants' ancient war against dragonkind.

A crystal window facing the interior of the stronghold provides a clear view of the swirling vortex, the sinkhole, and the other towers of Maelstrom&rsquo;s upper level. The mussel-shell tables in the middle of the room are covered with platters of boiled lobster, as well as edible urchins and fish, while shelves and cabinets hold various knick knacks.

<p>If her life is threatened and she is forced to retreat to her tower, Mirran arms herself with the greatsword mounted on the wall, and considers her next move while gazing through the crystal window. She is too proud to flee Maelstrom and give up what she believes is her birthright.</p>
