<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Operatives of the Kraken Society have King Hekaton in their clutches. If the characters forge an alliance with Princess Serissa and agree to find her father, she gives them a wooden coin painted with the image of a golden goose that was found near the corpse of her slain mother, Queen Neri. Serissa presumes (correctly) that the coin was accidentally dropped by one of her mother&rsquo;s assassins.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The characters begin this part of their mission by tracking the gambling chip to its owner, Lord Khaspere Drylund of Yartar. The nobleman is maneuvering to become the city&rsquo;s new Waterbaron. He runs a gambling hall aboard a riverboat named the <em>Grand Dame</em>. Lord Drylund&rsquo;s wealthy patrons are the movers and shakers of Yartar, and he wants to impress them and place them in his debt. They come to his riverboat day and night, exchanging coins for wooden gambling chips called &ldquo;golden geese.&rdquo; They dine on the finest prepared food, dance to marvelous music, and gamble away their chips at Lord Drylund&rsquo;s tables, all under the watchful eye of his chief of security, the wizard Pow Ming.</p>
<p>Tracking the wooden coin to its source requires some investigation and, perhaps, a little help from one or more factions. Once the coin is traced to a gambling hall aboard a resplendent riverboat in Yartar, the game is afoot! The characters must attack or infiltrate the riverboat to reach Lord Drylund, for only he knows where King Hekaton is kept. Drylund reveals under duress that the storm giant king is sequestered aboard a scry-proof vessel called the <em>Morkoth</em> that circles the islands of the Trackless Sea, far from prying eyes. Drylund&rsquo;s betrayal immediately precedes his doom, as Slarkrethel reaches out from the depths of the Trackless Sea and slays the corrupt nobleman with a telepathic thought.</p>
<p>The chapter concludes with the characters' hunt for the <em>Morkoth</em> and the freeing of King Hekaton, and perhaps a terrifying encounter with the kraken itself.</p>

It&rsquo;s half again the size of a typical gold coin, and there&rsquo;s nothing magical about it. A legend lore spell provides no clues as to its origin, since the coin isn&rsquo;t legendary.</p>
<p>Any character who has a background, a bond, or a flaw related to gambling or festhalls knows that the coin is likely a gambling chip. Ascertaining where the coin came from requires a period of downtime, during which a character can show the coin around, make inquiries at gambling houses and festhalls, and bribe local guilds for information. A character must spend a certain amount of gold per day to cover expenses. After <wc-roll>1d4+1</wc-roll> days, the character can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a success, the character learns where the coin came from. A failed check means that the character&rsquo;s investigation has reached a dead end, but he or she can try again by spending the requisite amount of time and gold. The DC of the check depends on where the investigation is conducted. Cities have more people to talk to and more leads to follow than towns or villages, but the expenses are higher. This information is summarized in the Finding the Golden Goose table.</p>

</span></p>
<p>You can rule that an investigation automatically fails if it is conducted in a particularly isolated location, such as the islands of Ruathym or Tuern, where it&rsquo;s unlikely that the characters will find anyone who is familiar with the festhalls and gambling havens of Yartar. Conversely, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, and the Zhentarim all have a strong presence in Yartar. Any character who belongs to one of these three factions can reach out to the organization and use this connection to gain advantage on the Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>

Lord Drylund has the statistics of a noble, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lord Drylund is unarmored (AC 11) and speaks Common, Dwarvish, and Elvish.</li>
<li>He wields a rapier with a bejeweled octopus-shaped hilt (worth 2,500 gp).</li>
<li>As long as Lord Drylund and Slarkrethel are on the same plane of existence, Lord Drylund is considered to be within range of the kraken&rsquo;s telepathy. While this telepathic link exists, Slarkrethel can use an action on its turn to deal 20 psychic damage to Lord Drylund. This damage is enough to kill Lord Drylund instantly.</li>
</ul>
<p>From dawn until dusk, the flat-bottomed wooden boat is moored at the city docks. Dockworkers come and go with food and other supplies throughout the day, watched closely by crew on deck.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span></p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s crew consists of a captain named Nelvin Storn (LE male Tethyrian human bandit captain) and eight deckhands (NE male and female Tethyrian human bandit). An hour before dusk, a mob of commoner (thirty-two rowers, six chefs, six servers, a dozen card dealers, a dozen escorts, and three musicians) arrives at the docks for inspection by the captain, who stands on the pier next to the ship&rsquo;s boarding ramp. Storn promises each hired worker 5 gp for good service, with payment made the next morning. Once the workers are aboard, rowers are expected to report to the lower deck (<strong>area 4</strong>), servers and chefs to the kitchen (<strong>area 8</strong>), card dealers and escorts to the casino (<strong>area 9</strong>), and musicians to the dance hall (<strong>area 14</strong>). Wealthy, well-dressed guests begin arriving around the same time as the workers. Guests are free to wander the ship but are advised to keep away from the bridge and crew quarters on the upper deck (areas 11-13). The <em>Grand Dame</em> has no living quarters for passengers, whether workers or guests.</p>
<p>Characters who approach the ship wearing armor or carrying unconcealed weapons are turned away. Those who threaten the ship or try to board it are attacked. A battle on the pier frightens off the workers and guests who aren&rsquo;t aboard. It also alerts a half dozen city guard patrolling the wharf, who arrive <wc-roll>1d4+2</wc-roll> rounds after the battle is joined and fight on the side of the ship&rsquo;s crew.</p>
<p>The adventurers might try to replace one or more of the workers or pose as wealthy guests. A character who wants to get aboard in this fashion must succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by Captain Storn&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. A character who wins the contest can board the ship without raising suspicion. If Storn wins the contest, he views the character as suspicious and demands an explanation for the individual&rsquo;s presence. Storn isn&rsquo;t really interested in the answer; he&rsquo;s looking to see how the character reacts. A character who reacts in a nonthreatening manner can repeat the check. If the character wins the contest, Storn&rsquo;s suspicions are allayed, and the character is permitted to board. If Storn wins the contest, the character is turned away. A character who refuses to leave is attacked.</p>
<p>On any given night, <wc-roll>2d6 Ã— 5</wc-roll> well-dressed aristocrats and guild members come aboard (treat these guests as unarmed and unarmored noble). Guests are expected to while away the hours dining, socializing, and gambling, all under the watchful eye of Lord Drylund&rsquo;s banker and security officer, Pow Ming (N female Shou human). Pow Ming has the statistics of a mage, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pow Ming speaks Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, and Elvish.</li>
<li>She has the <wc-fetch type=spell>detect thoughts</wc-fetch> spell prepared in place of <wc-fetch type=spell>misty step</wc-fetch>.</li>
<li>She carries a <wc-fetch type=item>bag of holding</wc-fetch> and wears a <wc-fetch type=item>robe of serpents</wc-fetch> with six snakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pow Ming keeps hundreds of golden goose chips in her <wc-fetch type=item>bag of holding</wc-fetch>. The bag is also where she keeps the money she receives in trade. At any given time, the bag holds <wc-roll>1d10 Ã— 100</wc-roll> gp. When the ship returns to port, Pow Ming pays out the winners, collects all the golden goose chips, and gives the remaining spoils to Lord Drylund, who places them in a locked chest (in <strong>area 13</strong>). If Pow Ming suspects that a guest might be cheating, she casts a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect thoughts</wc-fetch> spell to confirm or put to rest her suspicions. If she becomes convinced that someone is cheating, she uses her <wc-fetch type=spell>suggestion</wc-fetch> spell to convince the individual to take a flying leap off the deck of the ship.</p>
<p>Assuming that nothing happens to prevent its launch, the ship begins a slow, scenic journey upriver at dusk. Two deckhands oversee the rowers in <strong>area 4</strong>. Captain Storn and his six remaining deckhands take turns on the bridge (<strong>area 11</strong>). Pow Ming spends most of her evening in the gambling hall, keeping an eye on the guests (<strong>area 9</strong>). In the wee hours of the morning, the rowers turn the ship and head back to port so that guests and workers can disembark at dawn. Lord Drylund gives Storn money to pay the workers as they disembark.</p>
<p>Lord Drylund remains in his cabin (<strong>area 13</strong>) throughout the day, then emerges once the ship leaves port to greet every guest with a smile and a handshake, offering his favorites handfuls of free gambling chips. If he doesn&rsquo;t recognize one or more visitors, he questions them to see if they&rsquo;re worth keeping aboard. Drylund caters to those who have political influence in the city of Yartar, but he&rsquo;s eager to meet anyone with a lot of money. He expects his guests to be splendidly dressed-and unarmed. Those who are caught carrying concealed weapons are advised to cast their weapons overboard. Those who refuse to do so are unceremoniously thrown off the deck of the ship by the crew.</p>

Golden Goose Casino</h3><p>This large cabin has been transformed into a gambling hall, the centerpiece of which is a gold-plated wooden sculpture of a goose that rests on a table in the aft end. Glasses of fine wine, free for the taking, are arrayed around it. An unflattering portrait of a fat, foppish, grinning man (Lord Drylund) hangs on the wall across from a wooden spiral staircase that leads up to the dance hall (<strong>area 14</strong>).</p>
<p>Most of the floor space is taken up with tables of card games. From dusk until dawn, attractive dealers sit behind the tables, distributing cards to the players while small crowds look on. No actual currency passes into the hands of the hired help. Instead, bets are made with coin-sized wooden chips called golden geese, so named because each one bears Lord Drylund&rsquo;s golden goose emblem. Lord Drylund mingles with guests here, sometimes with his pet octopus on his shoulder, before retreating to his cabin (<strong>area 13</strong>) to count his money or spend time with one guest in particular-usually a &ldquo;new catch&rdquo; whom he tries to charm or bribe into supporting his political ambitions.</p>

<p>Pow Ming patrols the gambling hall in the evening, smiling at guests while watching for cheaters. She takes particular interest in customers who are on board for only the first or second time. If the characters threaten the ship or its passengers, she conjures one or more giant snakes with the aid of her <wc-fetch type=item>robe of serpents</wc-fetch> and uses her spells to try to defeat them while being careful not to harm crew or passengers.</p>

Learning the truth wouldn&rsquo;t surprise her, however. Although she&rsquo;s not evil, Pow Ming is no saint. Her ultimate goal is to join the Arcane Brotherhood. In the meantime, she&rsquo;s using Lord Drylund to meet rich, influential people who might have contacts within that organization. If the characters eliminate Lord Drylund but leave Pow Ming alive and the riverboat intact, Pow Ming takes over the whole enterprise.</p>

Lord Drylund&rsquo;s Cabin</h3><p>If he&rsquo;s not shaking hands and whispering in the ears of guests, Khaspere Drylund is here, dreaming of the day when he rules Yartar as its Waterbaron. He also receives occasional telepathic static from the kraken Slarkrethel, which leaves him with crushing headaches that last for hours.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Lord Drylund&rsquo;s cabin is a testament to bad taste, with its purple velvet curtains and scented candles in gaudy candelabras. In the middle of the room is a table with a large aquarium tank resting atop it. The aquarium contains a coral reef that serves as home for Lord Drylund&rsquo;s pet octopus. The octopus has bonded with its owner and can survive outside of water for 30 minutes. Beneath the aquarium, built into the table, is a shelf on which rests a locked wooden chest rigged with a poison needle trap (see the &ldquo;Sample Traps&rdquo; section in chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>). Lord Drylund hides the key inside a miniature &ldquo;dead man&rsquo;s chest&rdquo; lying inside the aquarium, and the octopus attacks any creature other than Lord Drylund that tries to reach for it.</p>
<p>Other furnishings include a silk hammock, a writing desk (covered with quills and loose sheets of blank parchment), a small table holding a silver wine decanter and matching goblet, and an iron stove.</p>

If the characters corner and threaten him, he surrenders without a fight. He admits under interrogation that he&rsquo;s a member of the Kraken Society and reveals where King Hekaton is being kept. After he divulges that Hekaton is a prisoner aboard the <em>Morkoth</em>, which sails around the northern islands of the Trackless Sea, Lord Drylund&rsquo;s eyes widen in terror as he receives a telepathic message from the kraken-a wave of mind-shattering dread that deals 20 psychic damage to the nobleman. An instant later, Lord Drylund keels over dead, blood running from his nose.</p>

If Lord Drylund dies before the characters learn King Hekaton&rsquo;s whereabouts, they can still learn where the storm giant king is being held by casting a <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> spell on Lord Drylund&rsquo;s corpse. If that option is unavailable to them, they can raise Lord Drylund from the dead. If they lack the means to do so themselves, they can bring Lord Drylund&rsquo;s body to a temple in any major city and pay to have the <wc-fetch type=spell>raise dead</wc-fetch> spell cast. The party must provide the material component of the spell (a diamond worth at least 500 gp) and make a donation of 500 gp to the temple. If one or more of the characters are members of the Lords' Alliance, they can muster the resources to acquire a <wc-fetch type=item>Spell Scroll (5th level)</wc-fetch> <wc-fetch type=spell>raise dead</wc-fetch> free of charge, as long as they&rsquo;re in Yartar or another settlement that&rsquo;s part of the Lords' Alliance (see &ldquo;The Lords' Alliance&rdquo; section in chapter 1).</p>
<p>Slarkrethel has cast a powerful spell on the <em>Morkoth</em>, its crew, and their prisoner, hiding them all from divination magic. Neither the ship nor anyone aboard it can be targeted by any form of divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p>

The ship&rsquo;s precise location changes from one hour to the next and is ultimately not important, nor is it imperative that the characters find the vessel quickly.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Chapter 3 describes random encounters you can use to spice up a sea voyage. To calculate how long it takes for the characters to find the <em>Morkoth</em>, ascertain the rough distance from the party&rsquo;s starting location to the Purple Rocks, then calculate the amount of time it would take the party&rsquo;s conveyance to travel that distance. Once the characters get within 100 miles of the Purple Rocks, they have a base 10 percent chance per day of locating the <em>Morkoth</em>. This chance assumes that the characters are traveling in one group or aboard multiple conveyances in fairly close formation. If multiple conveyances are searching for the <em>Morkoth</em> and they are so widespread as to be at least 30 miles apart, roll separately for each conveyance.</p>
<p>You can forgo precision and assume that the party spots the <em>Morkoth</em> <wc-roll>1d4+2</wc-roll> days after coming within 100 miles of the Purple Rocks.</p>

<p>To create a more realistic journey, you can use the Weather table in chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em> to determine the prevailing weather on a given day. If the results indicate strong wind and heavy rain, these weather conditions combine to create a storm that lasts for <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> hours.

Once the <em>Morkoth</em> is sighted, the characters can attack it from a distance or fly in close. The airship can&rsquo;t land on the <em>Morkoth</em>, but it can float in the water nearby or hover directly overhead, out of the line of fire of the <em>Morkoth&rsquo;s</em> ship-mounted ballistae.</p>

Weather conditions might hinder their search, but there is no chance of the castle&rsquo;s being blown off course by a storm.</p>

Dragons don&rsquo;t tire as easily and can transport characters overseas if they are sufficiently motivated. Dragons are also able to avoid and outpace storms. A friendly metallic dragon of the party&rsquo;s acquaintance might be persuaded to make the journey for a sizable donation to its trove. One rare magic item or 10,000 gp per passenger wouldn&rsquo;t be unreasonable</p>

Since the islands of the Trackless Sea are home to predatory, seafaring barbarians, most ship captains are unwilling to risk their vessels and lives on a fool&rsquo;s errand, no matter how much the characters offer to pay. Another possibility exists for characters who are associated with the Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet, the Emerald Enclave, the Lords' Alliance, or the Zhentarim. Members in good standing of any of those groups can contact their organizations and convince them that an expedition must be mounted to find the Morkoth, for the sake of all civilization. Roll <wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll> for each faction that the characters approach for assistance; the result is the number of days it takes for that faction to secure and provision a sailing ship. If a deck plan of the ship becomes necessary, use the sample ship that appears in Appendix C of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>. Where the characters must go to board each vessel depends on the faction that provides the help.</p>
<p>The Harpers hire a brooding Waterdhavian captain named Zaldar Floshin (NG male half-elf mage). His ship, the <em>Kelpie&rsquo;s Kiss</em>, has a sprite named Arrow as its first mate and fifteen crewmembers (N male and female Tethyrian human bandit). A Harper agent named Ilkara Levari (CG female half-elf spy) serves as the ship&rsquo;s bosun. The ship is docked in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>The Order of the Gauntlet hires a merchant ship owned by a Waterdhavian noble named Arilosa Adarbrent, who supports the order financially. Her ship is the <em>Coin Toss</em>, and its captain is Tazlan Rilzeer (NG male Tethyrian human bandit captain), a fearless scoundrel with a sharp wit. His crew includes fifteen sailors (N male and female human bandit of various ethnicities) and a cheery, overweight medic named Tharkil Morn (LG male Tethyrian human priest of Helm). The ship is docked in Neverwinter.</p>
<p>The Emerald Enclave hires the <em>Koalinth</em>, a ship under the command of a hobgoblin captain named Klarz and crewed by twenty hobgoblin and five bugbear. Klarz owes his life to an Emerald Enclave ranger who helped him after the two were stranded together on a monster-infested island in the Korinn Archipelago. This service repays Klarz&rsquo;s debt to the Emerald Enclave. Klarz&rsquo;s ship waits for the characters in a cove several miles north of Waterdeep.</p>
<p>The Lords' Alliance recently captured a pirate ship called the <em>Ravenous</em>, along with its nefarious captain, Sharlasta Stormsword (LE female Illuskan human bandit captain). After cooling her heels in prison, Stormsword is visited by Lord Dagult Neverember, who strikes a deal with her. When she is released from custody and returned to her ship, Stormsword gathers a crew of twenty half-trained scalawags (commoner of various races and alignments) and whips them into shape for the voyage, the completion of which guarantees her a pardon signed by the Lords' Alliance leaders. The <em>Ravenous</em> is anchored in Neverwinter&rsquo;s bay.</p>
<p>The Zhentarim assigns Captain Drashk (N male tiefling bandit captain) to command a ship called the <em>Lost Cause</em> and assigns him a crew of six Zhentarim mercenaries (N male and female human thug of various ethnicities) and twelve deckhands (commoner of various races and alignments). The eye-patch-wearing captain has an imp that perches on his shoulder and wreaks havoc with his moral compass. Drashk also has permission to negotiate trade deals with the storm giant king on behalf of the Black Network, should the opportunity arise. The <em>Lost Cause</em> is anchored in Waterdeep&rsquo;s bay.</p>
<p>Other ships that might be available to the characters are presented in the &ldquo;Reaching Svardborg&rdquo; section in chapter 7.</p>
<h2 id=the-morkoth>
<a href=#the-morkoth class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Morkoth</h2><p>The <em>Morkoth</em> (shown on map 11.2) is a bizarre-looking yet seaworthy vessel with a hull that resembles a giant squid. As it plies the Trackless Sea, the top of the forward stabilizing fin remains above the water while the aft tentacles trail behind underwater. The <em>Morkoth</em> has the statistics of a sailing ship (see the Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Its captain, Tholtz Daggerdark (CE male Illuskan human <em>archmage</em>), is one of Slarkrethel&rsquo;s mad, devoted thralls. He claims to be in constant telepathic contact with the kraken, though in truth Tholtz can only receive telepathic messages from the kraken, and such messages are rare and tend to give him nosebleeds.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Tholtz&rsquo;s first mate is Rool (NE male half-orc assassin), a vicious cutthroat who despises Captain Daggerdark and looks forward to gutting him like a fish one day. Rool&rsquo;s hatred of the wizard is well earned, for Tholtz frequently refers to the half-orc as a &ldquo;soulless half-breed,&rdquo; a &ldquo;human mistake,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;mongrel.&rdquo; Rool oversees a crew of twenty Kraken Society cultist (CE male and female humans of various ethnicities) while Tholtz pretends to talk to Slarkrethel or raves on and on about the spells the kraken has promised to teach him. Morale aboard the ship is understandably low.</p>
<p>Half of the cultists are on duty at any given time, while the rest are asleep in their hammocks (<strong>area 4</strong>). When the characters first come upon the <em>Morkoth</em>, Captain Daggerdark is resting in his cabin (<strong>area 5</strong>) as well. Rool is behind the wheel atop the aft castle (<strong>area 2</strong>), and the ten awake cultists are manning the ballistae or keeping an eye on the storm giant prisoner. For ballista rules and statistics, see the &ldquo;Siege Equipment&rdquo; section in chapter 8 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>.</p>
<p>Any loud disturbances on deck cause the captain and the sleeping cultists to awaken and investigate. Unless the characters approach the <em>Morkoth</em> invisibly, it is likely that the entire ship&rsquo;s crew will be armed and ready to face them in battle.</p>
<p>Escorting the <em>Morkoth</em> are four merrow loyal to Slarkrethel. These creatures swim alongside the vessel, two on each side, and use their harpoons to impale enemies and pull them into the water. Merrow harpoons have ropes made of tightly woven kelp attached to them so that they can be reeled in. If it misses with its harpoon attack, a merrow can use its next action to reel in the harpoon. If another creature is holding onto the harpoon, the merrow regains the weapon if it wins a contested Strength check. If characters take cover to avoid harpoon attacks, or if the merrow are unable to hurl their harpoons, the merrow crawl up onto the deck and attack with their teeth and claws, pursuing prey into the Morkoth&rsquo;s lower deck if necessary.</p>

Once Daggerdark is dispatched, Rool continues to fight the adventurers to the bitter end, grinning with the satisfaction that he dealt the fatal blow to his hated rival.</p>

Hekaton in Chains</h3><p>Two Kraken Society cultist stand watch on the decks fore and aft of King Hekaton, who lies on his back in the ship&rsquo;s hold, wrapped in magical chains that trap him in stasis. The 28-foot-tall giant appears frozen in time, his eyes open and staring blindly into the sky. He is effectively restrained and unconscious while bound in this manner. Four chains bind him. The chains are secured to the hull and must be broken to release the giant from his stasis or free him from the ship&rsquo;s hold. Striking a chain alerts any <em>Morkoth</em> crew members not already engaged in battle.</p>
<p>Each chain has AC 20, 10 hit points, and immunity to all damage except bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from adamantine or magic weapons. If all four chains are broken, Hekaton&rsquo;s stasis ends and he is no longer restrained or unconscious. If Hekaton is awakened during a battle, roll initiative for the storm giant king. Hekaton is a storm giant, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hekaton has 330 hit points.</li>
<li>He has no greatsword but can wield a length of broken chain as a melee weapon, making two attacks with it as an action on his turn. Each chain attack has a +14 bonus to hit, has a reach of 15 feet, and deals 19 (<wc-roll>3d6+9</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a hit.</li>
<li>He has no rocks to hurl but can pick up a shipboard ballista and use it like a heavy crossbow. The ballista gains the heavy, loading, and two-weapon properties when used in this way (see the &ldquo;Weapon Properties&rdquo; section in chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook). The weapon retains its range, attack modifier, and damage (see the &ldquo;Siege Equipment&rdquo; section in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide).</li>
<li>As a bonus action on his turn, Hekaton can shift his weight and cause any ship upon which he stands to heave to one side or the other. All other creatures standing on the ship must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=development-3>

The last thing he remembers was being ambushed during a meeting with small folk, whom he was led to believe were representatives of the Lords' Alliance. (In fact, they were Kraken Society operatives in disguise.) The only individual aboard the <em>Morkoth</em> that Hekaton recognizes is Rool the half-orc, who was part of the group that ambushed him.</p>
<p>Hekaton rises to his full height and begins lashing out against small folk indiscriminately, shouting, &ldquo;Lords' Alliance indeed! I&rsquo;ll see your alliance wrecked upon the waves for this treachery!&rdquo; A character can use an action to try to persuade the king to stand down or not attack certain targets. That character must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check to calm down the king. If the check fails, the character&rsquo;s words fall on deaf ears. If the character mentions Serissa by name, the check is made with advantage.</p>
<p>Hekaton has no idea that his court has been thrown into upheaval and that evil forces are conspiring to usurp his throne. Only when the battle aboard the <em>Morkoth</em> has ended can the characters bring Hekaton up to date on recent developments. Regardless of what he is told, the king remains skeptical until he has had a chance to speak with his daughter, Serissa, and his brother, Uthor. He urges the characters to return to Maelstrom with him. Characters can either use Hekaton&rsquo;s conch to teleport themselves and the storm giant king to Maelstrom, or they can follow Hekaton as he dives into the water and swims home.</p>
<p>If the characters want to delay their departure, Hekaton agrees to stay around long enough for them to search the <em>Morkoth</em> or to take care of other matters. For example, the characters might need to conclude some business with the captain of the ship that brought them here, or they might need time to gather belongings from their airship. If Hekaton and the characters remain in the vicinity of the <em>Morkoth</em> for more than 1 hour, they are present when Slarkrethel shows up (see &ldquo;The Kraken Cometh&rdquo; section at the end of this chapter).</p>

Captain&rsquo;s Cabin</h3><p>Tholtz Daggerdark&rsquo;s cabin is a mess. Nautical books and navigational charts are strewn across the floor, as are quills, loose sheets of blank parchment, empty wine bottles, and spilled jars of ink. Most of the furniture is bolted to the floor, including an unmade bed with a squid-shaped headboard, a writing desk stained with ink, an open trunk, a slender wardrobe stuffed with old robes, and a wooden cloak rack.</p>
<p>If he hasn&rsquo;t been disturbed, Tholtz the archmage is sleeping on the floor in a corner of the room, facing the cabin door. In his sleep, he used a knife to carve the words &ldquo;DRAGON,&rdquo; &ldquo;IYMRITH,&rdquo; &ldquo;SISTERS,&rdquo; and &ldquo;TREACHERY&rdquo; into the floorboards. If he is awakened by a loud disturbance on deck, he drops the knife and leaves the cabin to investigate. He doesn&rsquo;t know who or what Iymrith is, nor does he know why he carved these words into the cabin floor.</p>
<p>Tholtz casts <wc-fetch type=spell>mage armor</wc-fetch> on himself before entering battle. If enemies threaten him with ranged attacks, he casts <wc-fetch type=spell>fly</wc-fetch> on himself, then tries to maneuver himself into a position where he can deal the most damage to them.

First Mate&rsquo;s Cabin</h3><p>Rool&rsquo;s sparsely furnished cabin contains a hammock, a wooden treasure chest with a built-in lock, and a rug made from a yeti&rsquo;s hide.</p>
<p>Rool carries the key to the locked chest, which can be picked open with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The chest is rigged with a gorgon-gas trap that triggers if an attempt is made to pick the lock. Detecting the trap requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, and disabling it requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. If the attempt to disable the trap fails by 5 or more, the trap triggers. The green gas spills out through thin cracks in the lid and fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the chest. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be petrified for 1 hour.</p>

The first contains a sack of 180 gp. The second holds twelve nonmagical daggers that Rool has collected over the years. The third contains a deck of marked playing cards (worth 15 gp) in a wooden case, a spyglass (worth 1,000 gp), a quill, a jar of dragon blood (which Rool uses for ink), and a diary with a black leather cover.</p>
<p>In his diary, Rool articulately spells out why he would like to kill Captain Daggerdark and take command. The writing reveals that the captain claims to have a direct line of communication to the kraken Slarkrethel, an assertion that Rool suspects is true given that the captain is prone to headaches and nosebleeds. The diary also mentions that the captain keeps his spellbook in his desk, protected by &ldquo;the worst lock I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

The kraken leaves its lair in the darkest depths of the Trackless Sea and swims toward the <em>Morkoth</em>. The same magic that Slarkrethel placed on the <em>Morkoth</em> to conceal it from divination spells allows the kraken to locate the ship unerringly.</p>
<p>If the characters free Hekaton and leave the <em>Morkoth</em> within an hour of doing so, Slarkrethel arrives too late to stop them. If the characters are still aboard the <em>Morkoth</em> an hour after freeing Hekaton, the kraken pays them an unannounced visit. The kraken announces its arrival by wrapping its gigantic tentacles around the hull of the <em>Morkoth</em>. All creatures aboard the ship are surprised unless they are swimming beneath the vessel and can see the enormous kraken approaching from directly below the craft. Once the kraken strikes, all creatures in this encounter must roll initiative. Slarkrethel wants to terrify and humble the adventurers, not annihilate them, so it mainly uses its tentacles to crush the <em>Morkoth</em> and pull it into the depths. Under no circumstances does the kraken allow the ship to fall into enemy hands. As an action, the kraken can attack the <em>Morkoth</em> with all ten of its tentacles and deal 250 bludgeoning damage to the ship on each of its turns, accounting for the Morkoth&rsquo;s damage threshold and the kraken&rsquo;s siege monster feature. Assuming the ship has all its hit points when Slarkrethel attacks, the vessel is destroyed after the kraken&rsquo;s second turn in combat. While crushing the ship, the kraken can&rsquo;t take other actions but can use its legendary actions as normal. Hekaton isn&rsquo;t afraid to face the kraken, and the kraken in turn has no qualms about killing the storm giant king (see &ldquo;Development&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Slarkrethel is a kraken, with the following changes:</p>
<p>Slarkrethel has a challenge rating of 25 (75,000 XP).</p>
<p>It gains the Legendary Resistance and Spellcasting features described below, and it casts foresight on itself before it attacks.</p>

If Hekaton is present, the kraken tries to drag the storm giant king down with it, leaving the puny and insignificant surface-dwelling adventurers to fend for themselves. Hekaton doesn&rsquo;t survive long in the kraken&rsquo;s clutches. If the storm giant king dies, all is not lost. Characters can return to Maelstrom and report the sorry news to Serissa. Although Hekaton&rsquo;s death is hard on her, Serissa is determined to see the ordning restored in his name and takes her father&rsquo;s place in the next chapter of the adventure.</p>

If the characters fail to save King Hekaton, the adventure can proceed without him as long as the characters still have one or two allies in the court of the storm giant king. See the start of chapter 12 for details.</p>
<p>Failures and miscalculations on the part of the characters could create a situation in which they can&rsquo;t return to Maelstrom or have little reason to. For example, if they failed to rescue Hekaton from the Kraken Society&rsquo;s clutches and they lose the conch of teleportation, the characters might choose to avoid any further dealings with the storm giants and focus their attention elsewhere. The same development might ensue if the characters made enemies of Serissa and Uthor by stealing from the storm giants or harming members of the royal family. The storm giants notwithstanding, the characters might have a personal score to settle with Iymrith (a desire to avenge Harshnag, for example) and could decide to go after the dragon on their own once they find her lair. In such a case, you can time events so that the storm giants arrive at Iymrith&rsquo;s lair at the same time the characters do, giving the characters an opportunity to join forces with the giants and reconcile any past grievances. Conversely, the characters might choose to avoid another confrontation with Iymrith, effectively skipping chapter 12, and instead set their sights on the remaining evil giant lords. Try not to force the player characters one way or the other. Let them make the tough choices!</p>

As long as they try, the characters gain a level at the conclusion of this chapter and should be 10th level when they confront Iymrith in chapter 12, &ldquo;Doom of the Desert.&rdquo; Given the danger that Iymrith poses, players might want their characters to gain more levels before facing the ancient blue dragon in her lair. The characters can go after any evil giant lords that remain, gaining a level for every two they defeat, and face Iymrith at 11th or 12th level.</p>
