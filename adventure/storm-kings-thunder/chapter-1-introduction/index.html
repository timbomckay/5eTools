<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>This chapter is designed to advance a party of 1st-level characters to 5th level. The characters gain levels by accomplishing various goals, which are summarized in the Character Advancement sidebar at the end of the chapter. If the characters are already 5th level, skip ahead to chapter 2, &ldquo;Rumblings,&rdquo; using the information in appendix A if the characters are transitioning from another published adventure to this one.</p>
<p>Nightstone is a fortified settlement located a few miles south of the Ardeep Forest, in the untamed hills between Waterdeep and Daggerford. A lonely wooden signpost, standing where the trail to Nightstone meets the High Road, points the way to the settlement.</p>
<p>Nightstone&rsquo;s closest neighbors are the elves of the Ardeep Forest. Hunters from Nightstone have incurred the elves' wrath on multiple occasions. However, elves are the least of the settlement&rsquo;s problems, as fledgling heroes who come to Nightstone in search of adventure quickly discover.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The characters are traveling to Nightstone for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters have heard rumors of goblins terrorizing the settlement. The High Steward of Nightstone, Lady Velrosa Nandar, is a Waterdhavian noble. She is reportedly offering a reward to anyone willing and able to deal with the goblin threat.</li>
<li>Nightstone is a popular retreat for wealthy nobles who wish to hunt in the Ardeep Forest. Adventurers can earn good money by offering their services as guards on a hunt.</li>
<li>The residents of Nightstone have a longstanding and seemingly irreconcilable conflict with their northern neighbors, the elves of the Ardeep Forest. Lady Velrosa Nandar has been searching for skilled mediators to help resolve the dispute.</li>
<li>The Nightstone Inn is renowned for its food and cozy guest rooms. The dwarf innkeeper, Morak Ur&rsquo;gray, has a fondness for adventurers and a nose for lucrative adventuring opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create other adventure hooks using the information presented in this chapter about Nightstone.</p>
<p>When you and the players are ready to get underway, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been traveling along the High Road for days. As evening approaches, you spot a wooden signpost next to a trail that heads north into the hills. Nailed to the post are three arrow-shaped signs. The two marked &ldquo;Waterdeep&rdquo; and &ldquo;Daggerford&rdquo; follow the High Road but point in opposite directions. The third, marked &ldquo;Nightstone,&rdquo; beckons you to follow the trail. If memory serves, Nightstone is roughly ten miles up the trail.</p>
</blockquote>

You can adjust the boxed text for the time of day or night when the party arrives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After following the trail for ten miles, you hear the ringing of a bell. The sound grows louder as Nightstone comes into view. A river flows around the settlement, forming a moat. The village itself is contained within a wooden palisade, beyond which you see a windmill, a tall steeple, and the high-pitched rooftops of several other buildings. Apart from the ringing of the bell, you detect no other activity in the village. The trail ends before a lowered draw bridge that spans the moat. Beyond the drawbridge, two stone watchtowers flank an open gap in the palisade.</p>
<p>South of the village and surrounded by the river moat is a cone-shaped, flat-topped hill on which stands a stone keep enclosed by a wooden wall. The keep, which overlooks the village, has partially collapsed. A wooden bridge that once connected the keep to the village has also partially collapsed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nightstone got its name from a massive chunk of obsidian that once stood in the middle of the village square. The obsidian megalith had strange glyphs carved into it and radiated magic under the scrutiny of <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spells, but its properties and purpose couldn&rsquo;t be ascertained. The villagers assumed it was a relic of some bygone age or kingdom and left it alone.</p>
<p>Three days ago, a cloud giant castle passed over Nightstone and dropped large rocks on the settlement and its keep. Unable to defend themselves against the bombardment, villagers who weren&rsquo;t killed in the attack lowered the drawbridge and fled into the nearby hills, taking refuge in some caves. Once the village was abandoned, four cloud giants descended from the sky, uprooted the nightstone, and bore it back to their castle for further study, believing it to be an Ostorian artifact. The cloud castle then drifted away with its prize.</p>
<p>The villagers were surprised to find a clan of goblins and an allied pair of ogres lurking in the caves. The villagers were ambushed, captured, and brought before Hark, the goblin boss. Hark interrogated them, learned of the giant attack on Nightstone, and sent a band of goblins to plunder the abandoned village. Characters who capture and interrogate these goblins can learn where the villagers are located.</p>
<p>The following warning signs indicate that all is not well in Nightstone:</p>
<ul>
<li>The drawbridge (<strong>area 1</strong>) is lowered, and the perimeter watchtowers (<strong>area 2</strong>) are unguarded.</li>
<li>The temple bell (<strong>area 5</strong>) won&rsquo;t stop ringing.</li>
<li>The keep (<strong>area 14</strong>) and the bridge that connects it to the village (<strong>area 11</strong>) have partially collapsed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Goblins are scouring the village for treasure. They have unwisely spread themselves thin, providing adventurers with an opportunity to pick them off one or two at a time. A goblin that is alone and outnumbered might try to flee if it takes damage, at your discretion. If possible, the goblin retreats to the temple (<strong>area 5</strong>). See the &ldquo;Nightstone: General Features&rdquo; sidebar for information about the settlement. Map 1.1 shows its layout. The sections that follow describe locations on that map.</p>

The settlement&rsquo;s general features are summarized here.</p>
<p><strong>Bailey.</strong> A 15-foot-high wooden palisade encloses the village bailey. The palisade&rsquo;s logs rise to sharpened points, and the gaps between the logs are sealed with tar. The palisade and its stone watchtowers (see <strong>area 2</strong>) can&rsquo;t be climbed without the aid of climbing gear or magic, such as a <wc-fetch type=spell>spider climb</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>All the buildings in the village except the watchtowers are made of wood and have steep, shingled rooftops. Muddy paths connect them.</p>
<p><strong>Moat.</strong> Water from the river fills the moat to a depth of 15 feet. The moat is 30 feet wide, narrowing to a width of 20 feet under the drawbridge (<strong>area 1</strong>). The moat is home to schools of trout.</p>
<p><strong>Motte.</strong> The keep overlooking the village stands atop a constructed, funnel-shaped hill called a motte. The rocky slopes of the motte are covered with loose shale, and scaling these slopes without climbing gear requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>Encircling the motte&rsquo;s keep is an 8-foot-high stone parapet with a 15-foot-high outer curtain wall made of thick wooden planks perforated with shuttered archer windows. The outer walls of the keep are made of smooth, tightly fitted stone bricks. The keep and the outer curtain wall can&rsquo;t be climbed without the aid of climbing gear or magic, such as a <wc-fetch type=spell>spider climb</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p><strong>Rocks.</strong> As the characters explore Nightstone, they see ample evidence of the giants' attack: rocks embedded in the earth, holes punched through rooftops, shattered wreckage, and dead villagers buried under piles of debris. The cloud giants' rocks are 3 feet in diameter and weigh 500 pounds each.</p>

Drawbridge</h2><p>The drawbridge is lowered when the party first arrives. It is 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and made of sturdy oak planks. Iron chains bolted to the drawbridge connect to winch mechanisms in the nearby watchtowers (<strong>area 2a</strong>).</p>

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that most of the tracks (made by several dozen fleeing villagers) lead north. A successful check also reveals smaller humanoid tracks (made by roughly a dozen goblins) heading from the north toward the drawbridge, as well as two sets of unusually large wolf tracks (made by the worgs in <strong>area 3</strong>) heading in the same direction.</p>

Watchtowers</h2><p>Seven stone watchtowers stand along the village perimeter. Each tower is 20 feet tall, with a roof enclosed by crenellated battlements. Inside each tower is a wooden ladder that leads to an unlocked trapdoor in the roof.</p>
<h3 id=2a-west-towers>
<a href=#2a-west-towers class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>2a. West Towers</h3><p>Two watchtowers flank the entrance to the village, forming a gatehouse of sorts. Each tower contains a winch, and both mechanisms must be turned to extend or retract the chains that raise and lower the drawbridge. If both winches are operated simultaneously, it takes 1 round to raise or lower the drawbridge by 30 degrees. In other words, the fully lowered drawbridge can be fully raised in 3 rounds.</p>
<h3 id=2b-northwest-tower>
<a href=#2b-northwest-tower class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>2b.

East Tower</h3><p>The door to this tower is ajar, and a greedy goblin named Gwerk lurks within. Gwerk stole a silver locket from a nearby residence (<strong>area 4e</strong>) and is quietly admiring it. She&rsquo;s afraid the other goblins might try to take it from her.</p>

Square</h2><p>Two worg slaughtered a dog and are feasting on its remains in the northeast corner of the village square. The worgs move to attack any characters who enter the square. The worgs fight to the death. If combat erupts in the square and the temple bell has been silenced, the goblins in areas 4c and 9 hear the noise and investigate. They stay on the fringes of the battlefield and shoot arrows at the characters.</p>
<p>The square is a muddy open area with a 5-foot-deep hole in the middle of it. The nightstone once stood here, but the cloud giants took the megalith and left the hole behind. North of the hole is a covered well. Other features of the village square include an empty wooden cart and a couple of tethering posts planted firmly in the ground. From the square, characters can see signs identifying the Nightstone Inn (<strong>area 8</strong>) and the Lionshield Coster trading post (<strong>area 9</strong>).</p>

Most villagers assume that the ornate runes are purely decorative, but any character who understands Infernal can translate the script as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let all who enter this home without the consent of its owner burn for ninety-nine years in the depths of Nessus and freeze for a thousand more in the icy wastes of Cania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the northeast corner stands an aboveground crypt with the name Nandar engraved over its sealed entrance. Cracking the door seal requires a crowbar or similar tool and a successful DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>The Nandar crypt contains a stone bier, upon which rests a wooden coffin. The coffin can easily be pried open and holds the skeletal remains and tattered burial shroud of Lord Drezlin Nandar, the village&rsquo;s founder, who died one year ago. Neither the coffin nor the crypt contains anything of value. If one or more characters remove any of Lord Nandar&rsquo;s bones from the crypt, a specter forms in the crypt and attacks them.

<p>Morak is a natural leader. Realizing that the village couldn&rsquo;t defend itself against the cloud giants' bombardment, he led his fellow villagers to the Dripping Caves. In the confusion and panic, Morak left behind his only guest at the time: Kella Darkhope, a Zhentarim spy posing as a traveling monk.

Two smaller round tables and several chairs remain intact, and resting atop each table is an unlit oil lamp. Characters exploring this room can hear someone rummaging through the kitchen (<strong>area 8b</strong>).</p>
<p>Lying on the floor in the middle of the room is a dead goblin with a crossbow bolt sticking out of its chest. The goblin fell prey to Kella Darkhope, who is spying on the room through the gaping hole in her bedroom floor (see <strong>area 8f</strong>). A character who inspects the corpse and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check can determine that the wound is fresh, indicating that the goblin has been dead only a few minutes. If the characters linger here, Kella tries to eavesdrop on their conversation and learn more about them without revealing her location.

The northwest corner of the inn (pantry included) was destroyed by a falling rock. Most of the kitchen, however, was undamaged. Set into the north wall is a stone fireplace, and the floor is covered with broken dishware and scattered utensils.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Kella infiltrated Nightstone in the guise of a traveling monk and is waiting for Zhentarim reinforcements to arrive (see the &ldquo;Seven Snakes&rdquo; section). She had nothing to do with the cloud giant attack, but she intends to take over the village and turn it into a Black Network base. Her original plan was to drive away the Lionshield Coster and bully Lady Velrosa Nandar into subservience, but the cloud giant attack has left the abandoned village ripe for conquest while leaving its defenses more or less intact.</p>
<p>Kella isn&rsquo;t alone. The morning after the cloud giants attacked, a flying snake carrying a message from her Zhent associates arrived. The snake belongs to Xolkin Alassandar (see the &ldquo;Seven Snakes&rdquo; section), and it now coils around Kella&rsquo;s left arm.

If discovered, she pretends to be a guest who was knocked unconscious by falling debris and left behind after the giant attack.

Characters can see through her ruse with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by Kella&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check.

<p>The trading post consists of a 20-foot-square store and a 10-foot-by-20-foot side room containing storage shelves and a cot. The store&rsquo;s proprietor was a Tethyrian human named Darthag Ulgar. He escaped the giant attack but didn&rsquo;t survive long as a prisoner of the goblins (see the &ldquo;Dripping Caves&rdquo; section for details).</p>

<p>The windmill&rsquo;s interior is dark, gloomy, and filled with wooden gears and cogs that help turn the millstone.

<p>A creature with a Strength score of 15 or higher can leap across the broken section of the bridge if it moves at least 10 feet before the jump. The jump is made more difficult by the fact that the bridge is sloped:</p>
<ul>
<li>A creature jumping from the lower part of the bridge to the higher part must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to land on its feet. On a failed check, the creature falls prone at the broken edge of the bridge and takes 2 (<wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage from the fall.</li>
<li>A creature jumping from the higher part of the bridge to the lower part must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on its feet.

The nobles of House Nandar had a hunting lodge in the forest two centuries ago, but elves forced them to abandon it. Ten years ago, members of House Nandar-Lord Drezlin Nandar and Lady Velrosa Nandar-decided it was time to return. They built a new motte-and-bailey settlement south of the Ardeep Forest and began making forays into the woods with friends to hunt and explore. Unknown to the Nandars, wood elves from Evermeet then settled in the forest, determined to protect the remnants of old elf empires from plunder and desecration. As in the past, the interests of the elves and Nandars were at cross purposes. A year ago, the conflict came to a head, and the elves attacked Nightstone. Drezlin was among the many slain-shot and killed by elf arrows while standing on the roof of his keep. His widow, Lady Velrosa Nandar, made peace with the elves and promised to make no further incursions into the Ardeep Forest-a promise she kept for the rest of her life. Velrosa was mortally wounded when the cloud giants bombarded Nightstone, leaving the village without a lord or lady to govern it.</p>

Great Hall</h3><p>Half of the great hall lies buried under rubble. Four guard (NG male and female Illuskan humans) have placed the body of Lady Velrosa Nandar atop the shattered remains of an oak dining table and are arguing about next steps.</p>
<p>The guards' names are Sydiri Haunlar, Torem Breck, Alara Winterspell, and Kaelen Zam. No strong leader stands among them, so they turn to the characters for guidance and leadership. If the characters question the guards about what happened, they share the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nightstone was bombarded by rocks dropped from a giant castle in the sky. The keep was cut off from the village when a rock tore away part of the bridge.</li>
<li>With nowhere to hide, the people in the village lowered the drawbridge and fled north. In the event of an attack, the villagers are supposed to retreat to the keep; with the bridge out, that was no longer an option.</li>
<li>North of Nightstone, about a mile away, are some bat caves. The villagers probably hid there.</li>
<li>Several guards stationed in the village fled north with the villagers.</li>
<li>Once the villagers had fled, four pale-skinned giants descended from the sky, uprooted the nightstone in the village square, and took it back to their castle. The cloud castle left soon thereafter, drifting eastward.</li>
<li>Lady Nandar was in the great hall when the roof collapsed. She was buried under the rubble and died before anyone could reach her.</li>
</ul>
<p>The great hall once served as a throne room and a dining room. Doors in the west wall lead to the kitchen (<strong>area 14b</strong>) and den (<strong>area 14c</strong>). Between these doors is a wooden staircase leading up to the second floor (<strong>area 14d</strong>).</p>

A wooden staircase in the west wall descends to the main floor. A similar staircase in the south wall climbs to the roof.</p>

Master Bedroom</h3><p>This room is the only one of three bedchambers to survive the cloud giants' attack. Tapestries and oil lamps are mounted on the walls, and wolfskin rugs cover the wooden floor. The room&rsquo;s centerpiece is a large bed, its ornate headboard sculpted with images of roses and foxes. Four wardrobes stand against the walls; each contains a season&rsquo;s worth of women&rsquo;s clothing, all in the latest fashions of Waterdeep. At the foot of the bed is an unlocked wooden chest.</p>
<p>Mounted above the door is a longsword. This weapon is actually a flying sword that attacks anyone who opens the chest. (Only Lady Nandar was able to open the chest without causing the sword to attack.) The guards in <strong>area 14a</strong> try to prevent anyone from looting the contents of the chest.</p>

<h2 id=seven-snakes>
<a href=#seven-snakes class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Seven Snakes</h2><p>This event takes place after the characters rid Nightstone of its goblin infestation but before they have time to finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Seven Zhentarim mercenaries arrive at the village on horseback. If the drawbridge is lowered, they ride to the square and call out for Kella Darkhope. If the characters raised the drawbridge, the Zhents call out for someone to lower it. If she&rsquo;s still alive, Kella tries to let them in.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/SKT/Xolkin.jpg alt=Xolkin class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>The leader of the new arrivals is Xolkin Alassandar (LE male half-elf bandit captain), a charming, ruthless man in his mid-thirties. He and his six subordinates (LE male and female human bandit of various ethnicities) are mounted on seven riding horse. Known as the Seven Snakes, Xolkin&rsquo;s band does &ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; for the Snail, a Zhent leader based in Daggerford (see the &ldquo;Daggerford&rdquo; section in chapter 3). Their current mission is to help Kella Darkhope turn Nightstone into a base for the Black Network. The settlement&rsquo;s defensibility and its proximity to Waterdeep make it ideal for Zhentarim operations. The Seven Snakes had planned to infiltrate the village posing as bounty hunters in search of a wanted criminal (Kella), but they drop the ruse once it becomes apparent that the village is mostly abandoned.</p>
<p>Xolkin is in love with Kella and would do just about anything for her, even though he knows that she doesn&rsquo;t feel the same way about him. If Kella is a prisoner, Xolkin tries to buy her freedom (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;). Failing that, he tries to liberate her by force. If Kella wormed her way into the characters' good graces, she reveals her allegiance to the Zhentarim once the Seven Snakes are close enough to protect her. If the party includes one or more characters with strong ties to the Black Network, Kella tries to convince them to help secure the village as a Zhentarim base.</p>
<p>If the characters do nothing to oppose the Zhent mercenaries, Xolkin orders his men to raise the drawbridge while he uses his flying snake to send a message to the Snail, letting him know that the village is under the Black Network&rsquo;s control. If the characters killed Xolkin&rsquo;s flying snake, Xolkin orders one of his mercs to ride to Daggerford and report the news while the others &ldquo;hold down the fort.&rdquo; If combat erupts, Xolkin drinks his <wc-fetch type=item>potion of invulnerability</wc-fetch> before leaping into the fray.</p>
<p>The Zhents have no easy way to reach the keep and ignore it for the time being. That said, if the Zhents learn that some of Lady Nandar&rsquo;s guards are holed up in the keep, they urge friendly characters to dispose of the guards. Similarly, if the characters are on friendly terms with the guards in the keep, the guards ask the characters to save the village from Zhentarim occupation.</p>
<p>The characters are under no obligation to rid Nightstone of Kella Darkhope and the Seven Snakes. If they defeat the Zhents or come to terms with them, allow the characters to take a long rest, if they wish, before continuing with the &ldquo;Ear Seekers&rdquo; event.</p>

Gurrash, the orc war chief, recently led an attack on the forest. Unfortunately for the orcs, the elves were ready for them. More than half of the orc horde perished, and the surviving orcs were forced to flee. Gurrash and several orcs escape out of the forest, make their way south, and stumble upon Nightstone. Knowing that the elves aren&rsquo;t far behind, Gurrash and his orcs try to fight their way into the village and make a stand there.</p>
<p>Gurrash, the orc war chief, is bleeding from wounds inflicted by elven arrows and has 60 hit points remaining. He leads a force consisting of twenty uninjured orc and an uninjured orc Eye of Gruumsh named Norgra One-Eye. Norgra is Gurrash&rsquo;s lieutenant and assumes command if the war chief dies.</p>
<p>The orcs have no gear other than their weapons and armor. If the drawbridge is lowered, they rush toward it and try to storm the village, killing other creatures in their path. If the drawbridge is raised, the orcs swim across the moat and try to climb the palisade, with no success. After being thwarted by the palisade, Gurrash sends scouts downriver to find another point of entry. It takes these orcs 10 minutes to realize that they can enter the village through the gap in the palisade where the bridge (<strong>area 11</strong>) leads up to the keep. Once the orcs enter the village, they fight to the death and don&rsquo;t take prisoners. Because the orcs don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re up against, characters can try to hide in the village and pick off a few orcs at a time. They can also retreat to the keep, which the orcs ignore.</p>
<p>If the orcs lose more than half their number without gaining a foothold in the village, the survivors flee into the surrounding hills. Once the orcs are defeated, the characters can advance to 3rd level and head to the Dripping Caves to locate and retrieve the missing villagers. If they&rsquo;re not sure where the villagers went, Kella Darkhope or the guards in the keep can point them in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Strange Bedfellows.</strong> If the characters came to terms with the Black Network in the previous event and the Seven Snakes are still around when the orcs arrive, the Zhents help the party defend Nightstone. Xolkin and Kella aren&rsquo;t heroes and don&rsquo;t place themselves in unnecessary danger, but they are quick to raise the drawbridge or position defenders on the watchtowers as needed. Knowing that orcs are devastating melee combatants, the Zhents favor ranged attacks and try to keep the orcs at a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Elves to the Rescue!</strong> If the characters are in danger of being overwhelmed by War Chief Gurrash and his bloodthirsty orcs, eight elves of the Ardeep Forest (CG male and female wood elf scout) arrive from the north to assist them. The leader of this band is a daring wood elf named Rond Arrowhome. He and his fellow elves have no love or respect for the residents of Nightstone, but they hate orcs more. Once the orcs are defeated, Rond yells out, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome!&rdquo; before leading the elves back to the Ardeep Forest. The elves aren&rsquo;t looking to pick a fight or mend fences with Nightstone&rsquo;s inhabitants, and they aren&rsquo;t interested in any kind of reward.</p>
<h2 id=dripping-caves>
<a href=#dripping-caves class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Dripping Caves</h2><p>The hills around Nightstone are riddled with caves. The villagers hid in the Dripping Caves, located a mile north of Nightstone, after the cloud giant attack. Characters who follow the villagers' tracks or are given directions discover a gaping cave mouth on the south face of a rocky hill topped with pine trees. Characters who use this entrance arrive in <strong>area 1</strong> of the Dripping Caves.</p>
<p>If the characters take an hour to circle the hill, they find two other entrances. At the base of the hill, on the west side, is a narrow tunnel into which a stream flows. This tunnel is 40 feet long and leads to <strong>area 6</strong>. On the east side of the hill is a dry, 100-foot-long tunnel that gently slopes down to <strong>area 3a</strong>.</p>
<p>If the characters climb to the top of the hill and look around for other possible entrances, they find a natural chimney (a 5-foot-diameter shaft) that descends 50 feet to <strong>area 7</strong>. The chimney has abundant handholds and can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. No ability check is required if the characters use a rope or climbing gear.</p>
<p>A goblin clan driven from the Ardeep Forest by wood elves took refuge in the Dripping Caves a little over a month ago. A week later, while scouring the hills for food, they befriended a mated pair of ogres and lured them to the caves for protection. The goblins and ogres captured the Nightstone refugees and have started eating the villagers. Prisoners that the goblins haven&rsquo;t eaten are doomed to meet a similar fate unless the adventurers intervene.</p>
<p>Hark, the goblin boss, isn&rsquo;t an unreasonable creature. His instincts for self-preservation outweigh any natural animosity he feels toward his enemies or his prey. Characters can negotiate with Hark and avoid unnecessary bloodshed (see <strong>area 9</strong>), or they can kill Hark and his followers to win the villagers' freedom-the choice is theirs.</p>
<p>The characters should be 3rd level by the time they set foot in the Dripping Caves. Map 1.2 shows the caves' layout. The sections that follow describe locations on that map.</p>

<p><strong>Darkness.</strong> The Dripping Caves contain no light sources. The goblins and ogres rely on their darkvision to see.</p>
<p><strong>Dripping Water.</strong> The caves get their name from the water that constantly drips from the stalactites in the main cavern (<strong>area 1</strong>). The sound of dripping water echoes throughout the complex but isn&rsquo;t loud enough to drown out other distinctive noises.</p>
<p><strong>Narrow Tunnels.</strong> The tunnels leading away from the main cavern (<strong>area 1</strong>) are 7 to 8 feet high and range in width from 2 to 5 feet. Ogres and other Large creatures can squeeze through these passages, but they suffer the normal penalties for doing so (see the &ldquo;Squeezing into a Smaller Space&rdquo; section in chapter 9 of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Walls.</strong> The walls are damp and slick, but thanks to an abundance of handholds and footholds, they can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>

Main Cavern</h2><p>Characters who follow the villagers' tracks arrive at a yawning cave mouth, 12 feet wide and 20 feet high. Beyond the cave mouth is a vast cavern with a forest of stalagmites in its center and 10-foot-high ledges along its walls. Water drips from the stalactite-covered ceiling, which rises to a height of 30 feet in the middle of the cavern. Six naturally formed tunnels lead from this central cavern to other parts of the cave complex. The floor is littered with broken spears, broken shields, and drops of bat guano.</p>
<p>Characters who peer into the cave can see a male ogre bathing in a pool of mud (see <strong>area 1b</strong>). Those with darkvision can also see one or more goblin sentries on ledges (see <strong>area 1a</strong>). If the characters are carrying light sources or making a lot of noise, the creatures in areas 1a, 1b, and 1c detect them and attack.</p>

Ledges</h3><p>Ten-foot-high ledges of rock have formed along the walls of the cavern. Climbing up to a ledge or safely descending from one requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>Five goblin stand guard on the ledges-one on each ledge marked with a &ldquo;1a&rdquo; tag on the map. Their names are Gleek, Lop, Nitch, Pox, and Slibberdabber. When they detect intruders, the goblins cry out &ldquo;Bree-yark!&rdquo; and begin shooting arrows. Their cries of alarm put the rest of the cave complex on alert, but no reinforcements arrive.</p>

The mud pool is considered difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Nob and his mate (see <strong>area 1c</strong>) work for Boss Hark, who browbeats them into service with his superior intellect and nasty disposition. Nob tries to crush enemies with his greatclub. If his enemies try to flee, Nob and his mate chase after them.</p>

In the middle of the stalagmite &ldquo;forest&rdquo; is a clear space. The ogres have turned this space into a den, and a female ogre named Thog is sleeping here when the characters first arrive. She awakens to sounds of combat or cries of alarm, and either hurls javelins or wades into battle with her greatclub. A search of the ogres' den yields nothing of value.</p>

The Blob</h3><p>Stalactites and stalagmites crowd this 20-foot-high, 15-foot-wide cave. Rising up from the middle of the floor is a particularly large (10-foot-tall) stalagmite riddled with 4-inch-wide, 12-inch-deep naturally formed holes that bore down into a hollow central cavity. Lying near the base of the stalagmite are the badly corroded remains of two goblin scimitars.</p>
<p>A black pudding has taken residence inside the stalagmite&rsquo;s hollow core, and the holes in the stalagmite&rsquo;s &ldquo;shell&rdquo; are wide enough that a character can stick an arm, a staff, or a weapon into any one of them. The pudding makes a free pseudopod attack against anything that is inserted into one of the stalagmite&rsquo;s holes.</p>
<p>The pudding has total cover while inside the stalagmite&rsquo;s core. If left undisturbed, the pudding remains inside the stalagmite until the characters make their way toward <strong>area 3b</strong>, whereupon it quietly emerges and follows them. Once the characters are trapped in <strong>area 3b</strong>, the pudding attacks.</p>
<p><strong>East Tunnel.</strong> This 5-foot-wide, 7-foot-high tunnel slopes gently upward as it travels east. After 100 feet, it breaks through the east side of the hill.</p>

The goblins used to come here to drink fresh water, but they stopped visiting the cave when the black pudding in <strong>area 3a</strong> started picking them off.</p>
<p>Growing near the southeast wall is a patch of twenty green mushrooms. A character who inspects the mushrooms and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check can ascertain that they are poisonous.

Bats and Prisoners</h2><p>A short tunnel leads to a sunken cavern that echoes with the sound of flapping wings. The sound emanates from a naturally formed pit in the cavern&rsquo;s floor, which is covered with bat guano. Ten-foot-high ledges surround the pit and form raised alcoves to the north, east, and south. Huddled in these alcoves are thirty Nightstone villagers. The villagers are prisoners of the goblins and ogres, and they are trying to remain as quiet as possible for reasons that might not be readily apparent to the characters.</p>
<p>Directly below this cavern is another similarly sized cavern filled with thousands of bats. Any loud noise in either cavern agitates the bats. When the bats become agitated, have the characters roll initiative. On initiative count 10, the bats fly up the pit and flutter about the upper cave, shrieking loudly. The fluttering bats reduce visibility in the upper cavern to 5 feet. A creature takes 1 piercing damage whenever it enters a 5-foot-square area filled with fluttering bats. At the start of each of the bats' turns, roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll>. On a roll of 1-5, the bats remain agitated. On a roll of 6, the bats return to the lower cavern and are no longer agitated.</p>
<p>The pit descends through 20 feet of solid rock before opening into the lower cavern, which is 30 feet deep.</p>

The villagers fear for their lives but can&rsquo;t escape the Dripping Caves until the monsters in <strong>area 1</strong> are defeated. Every few hours, one of the ogres enters the cave, grabs a prisoner, and takes the unfortunate villager away to be eaten (if not by the ogres, then by the goblins in <strong>area 2</strong> or the giant rats in <strong>area 9</strong>).</p>
<p>In the absence of a true leader, Morak Ur&rsquo;gray (LG male shield dwarf commoner), the owner and proprietor of the Nightstone Inn, speaks on behalf of the villagers. Morak is an optimist, and he&rsquo;s counting on Lady Velrosa Nandar coming to the rescue. When he lays eyes on the adventurers, he breathes a sigh of relief and assumes they were hired by Lady Nandar. (He would be dismayed to learn that she didn&rsquo;t survive the attack on Nightstone.)</p>
<p>Other noteworthy prisoners trapped in the cavern include Hiral Mystrum (LG male Tethyrian human commoner), the village&rsquo;s cowardly priest of Lathander, and six unarmed guards (LN male and female guard of various ethnicities). The guards were wounded by the goblins and ogres in the process of being captured; each has only <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> hit points remaining.</p>
<p>The other prisoners found here are surviving members of local families. All the adults are unarmed commoner, and all the children are noncombatants. They let Morak speak on their behalf. The families are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Agganor Family.</strong> Destiny Agganor (age 42) is Nightstone&rsquo;s tiefling midwife. Her son, Grin Agganor (age 27), worked in the village&rsquo;s stable house, feeding the horses and cleaning the stalls for Lady Nandar. Destiny worships Asmodeus but doesn&rsquo;t impose her beliefs on anyone else, including her son.</p>
<p><strong>Delfryndel Family.</strong> The Delfryndels are Tethyrian humans. They own and operate Nightstone&rsquo;s windmill. The surviving family members are Renarra Delfryndel (age 64), her youngest son Zalf (age 40), his wife Elize (age 37), and their two adolescent children, Darson (age 17) and Hildy (age 14). No family members died in the giant attack, but Renarra&rsquo;s eldest son, Olaf, was killed and eaten by the goblins.</p>
<p><strong>Hulvaarn Family.</strong> The Hulvaarns are Damaran human potato and turnip farmers. The surviving family members are Godrick Hulvaarn (age 32), his wife Prennis (age 30), and their three children: daughter Jehanna (age 12) and twin sons Ellis and Ghalt (age 9). The children lost their grandfather (Godrick&rsquo;s father, Nestor) in the giant attack on Nightstone.</p>
<p><strong>Nesper Family.</strong> The Nespers are Tethyrian human pumpkin and squash farmers. None of them were killed in the giant attack, but three of them died at the hands of the goblins and ogres in the Dripping Caves. The remaining family members are Yondra (age 15) and her brother Sarvin (age 11). They lost both of their parents and an older sister named Sylda.</p>
<p><strong>Osstra Family.</strong> The Osstras are Tethyrian human wheat farmers. The surviving family members include Thelbin Osstra (age 52) and his husband, Brynn (age 52), and their good-hearted nephew, Broland (age 23). Brynn lost his elderly mother and younger sister (Broland&rsquo;s mother) to the goblins.</p>
<p><strong>Summerhawk Family.</strong> The Summerhawks are strongheart halflings. Taela Summerhawk (age 28), an apothecary, comforts her four young children, Barley (age 10), Midge (age 8), Nincy (age 6), and Dollop (age 3). Taela&rsquo;s husband, Larlow, was killed in Nightstone when a rock fell on their house.</p>

Fissure</h2><p>An 8-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep fissure splits a tunnel leading north. The goblins won&rsquo;t cross the fissure and haven&rsquo;t explored the tunnel. Where the tunnel leads is up to you. It might break the surface at some point, or it might lead to a monster&rsquo;s lair or the Ardeep Forest. If you don&rsquo;t want the characters wandering too far afield, inform the players that the tunnel collapsed after a few hundred feet, forcing the characters to turn back.</p>

The water doesn&rsquo;t taste good because of its high mineral content, but the goblins have been forced to drink it because their supply of fresh water has been cut off (see <strong>area 3</strong>).</p>
<p>If the characters enter the caves undetected and take refuge here, there&rsquo;s a 50 percent chance each hour that a goblin noncombatant enters the cave, looking for a drink of water. The goblin flees at the sight of intruders, heading north to <strong>area 9</strong>. The goblin has AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks.</p>

Natural Chimney</h2><p>A chimney has formed in the 7-foot-high ceiling of this small side cave. The chimney is 5 feet wide and has abundant handholds and footholds. A creature can climb up or down the shaft with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. No ability check is required if a rope or climbing gear is used.</p>
<p>An unscrupulous and ambitious goblin named Snigbat stands guard at the bottom of the shaft. Snigbat&rsquo;s job is to watch for intruders and report what she sees to Boss Hark. Snigbat considers this duty a form of punishment. If she sees one or more well-armed adventurers, Snigbat offers to lead them to Boss Hark if they promise to kill Hark and help Snigbat become the new boss. Snigbat knows where Hark keeps his treasure (<strong>area 8</strong>) but doesn&rsquo;t share this information with the characters in the hopes that she might get it.</p>

Hark&rsquo;s Hoard</h2><p>A large round rock fills the low, 4-foot-diameter tunnel leading to this cave. The boulder fits snugly in the tunnel and must be pushed into the cave to clear the passage. Moving the boulder out of the way requires a successful DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check. The sound of the rolling boulder is loud enough to be heard by the creatures in <strong>area 9</strong>.</p>
<p>The cave has an 8-foot-high ceiling and contains a grass pallet (Hark&rsquo;s bed), next to which rests a battered wooden chest with a rusty lock. The lock is purely for show and falls apart if handled roughly.</p>

Boss Hark&rsquo;s Cave</h2><p>This 10-foot-high cave contains Hark, the goblin boss, two female goblin (bodyguards) named Ratcha and Zukluk, and seven giant rat (Hark&rsquo;s beloved pets). When the characters enter the cave for the first time, Hark and his bodyguards are gleefully watching the rats feed on the corpse of a slain villager (Darthag Ulgar, the proprietor of the Lionshield Coster trading post).</p>
<p>Hark has collected all the weapons and shields belonging to the captured villagers and stashed the equipment in a western alcove behind rocks. Characters who search the cache find nine spears, five clubs, two daggers, and six wooden shields.</p>

Cowering in the back of this 6-foot-high larder is Lady Velrosa Nandar&rsquo;s terrified lady-in-waiting, Daphne Featherstone (LG female Tethyrian human commoner). Daphne was in the village when the cloud giants attacked. Unable to make it back to Nandar Keep, Daphne fled to the Dripping Caves with the other villagers-a decision she has come to regret.

He agrees to release the remaining villagers if the characters do one of the following things (and leave the goblin lair in peace):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay a ransom of 1 gold piece per villager. (The total amount is 31 gp, minus 1 gp for each villager who has died since the characters arrived at the caves.)</li>
<li>Give Hark a working lock. Hark needs the new lock for his treasure chest in <strong>area 8</strong>.</li>

<p>Once he is safely back in the village, Morak Ur&rsquo;gray takes stock of the damage, makes arrangements to deliver news of the giants' attack to Waterdeep, and urges the characters to undertake one of the following three quests. If Morak died in the Dripping Caves, another NPC can give the quest in his place. Choose whichever quest you like. Your choice will determine whether the characters visit Bryn Shander, Goldenfields, or Triboar in the next leg of the adventure (see chapter 2).</p>

Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see an enormous tower floating on a billowy cloud a thousand feet overhead. The tower must be hundreds of feet tall, and its spire looks strangely like a pointy wizard&rsquo;s hat. As the tower drifts closer, stairs made of clouds begin to form underneath it and descend toward you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Map 1.3 shows the tower. The stairs are made of firm cloud stuff and spiral downward, stopping just short of the ground. They are sized for humans and safe to climb. After climbing the stairs for 1,000 feet, the characters stand in front of the tower&rsquo;s entrance, on a cloud that feels as firm and safe as solid ground. If the characters enter the first floor of the tower, a cloud giant wizard named Zephyros descends from the second floor (using a <wc-fetch type=spell>levitate</wc-fetch> spell) to greet them.</p>

<p>Zephyros is an eccentric cloud giant with windswept white hair, a wispy white beard, and a billowy purple robe adorned with gold stars. He poses no threat to Nightstone or the characters.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/SKT/Zephyros.jpg alt=Zephyros class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>Ever since the ordning shattered, Zephyros has been using <em>contact other</em> plane spells to find a way to set things right. Failed castings of the spell have driven him insane on multiple occasions. He has recovered from the madness, yet it has accentuated his eccentricity. His magical investigations led him to Nightstone. He had nothing to do with the cloud giant attack on the settlement and is horrified to learn of the damage his fellow giants caused.</p>
<p>Zephyros holds &ldquo;small folk&rdquo; in higher regard than most giants. If the characters introduce themselves to him, a wide smile settles on the cloud giant&rsquo;s face as he realizes they are the ones mentioned by the mysterious planar entities with which he has spoken. Convinced that the characters can restore the ordning, Zephyros offers to transport them to one destination of their choice in the North. That is the extent of his involvement. The planar entities with whom Zephyros has spoken via the <wc-fetch type=spell>contact other plane</wc-fetch> spell warned him against taking a more direct hand in events. The party&rsquo;s destination should coincide with Morak&rsquo;s quest. After safely delivering the characters to their destination, Zephyros and his tower depart for the Moonshae Isles.</p>
<p>If the characters ask Zephyros to take them somewhere other than Bryn Shander, Goldenfields, or Triboar, Zephyros (eccentric wizard that he is) gets a little befuddled and ends up taking them to one of these places by accident.</p>
<p>Zephyros is a cloud giant, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zephyros is neutral good.</li>
<li>He has an Intelligence score of 18 (+4) and the spellcasting feature described below.</li>
<li>He carries a giant-sized staff of the magi instead of a morningstar. As an action, he can make two melee attacks with the staff. Each attack has a +15 bonus to hit and deals 20 (<wc-roll>3d6+10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a hit, or 23 (<wc-roll>3d8+10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands. This damage is considered magical.</li>
<li>He has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> Zephyros is a 12th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +11 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cantrips (at will): <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>message</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>prestidigitation</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>ray of frost</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>shocking grasp</wc-fetch></li>
<li>1st level (4 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>charm person</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>comprehend languages</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>magic missile</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>shield</wc-fetch></li>
<li>2nd level (3 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>crown of madness</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>gust of wind</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>levitate</wc-fetch></li>
<li>3rd level (3 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>nondetection</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>protection from energy</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>tongues</wc-fetch></li>
<li>4th level (3 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>conjure minor elementals</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>greater invisibility</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>Otiluke&rsquo;s resilient sphere</wc-fetch></li>
<li>5th level (2 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>cone of cold</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>contact other plane</wc-fetch></li>
<li>6th level (1 slot): <wc-fetch type=spell>mass suggestion</wc-fetch></li>
</ul>
<p>Zephyros&rsquo;s tower has no fitting accommodations for small folk, but the cloud giant wizard allows the party to camp on the first floor. He requests that the characters confine their activities to the first floor and stay away from the second floor and the aerie. Zephyros controls the tower&rsquo;s movements using a navigation orb on the second floor.</p>
<p>The Tower of Zephyros Travel Times table summarizes how long it takes the tower to travel from Nightstone to Bryn Shander, Goldenfields, or Triboar. Regardless of their ultimate destination, the characters have at least one encounter en route (see the &ldquo;Unfriendly Skies&rdquo; section for details).</p>

An open archway leads to an empty vestibule, at the back of which hangs a thin, translucent blue curtain that flaps in the breeze. Beyond the curtain lies a 100-foot high hexagonal chamber containing a giant-sized wooden table and stone chair. Dangling from the ceiling by iron chains are six crystal spheres with <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast on them. The illuminated spheres keep the room brightly lit.</p>

Furnishings include a giant-sized bed and an enormous wooden chest sealed by an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell. Stone shelves protrude from the walls at heights of 20, 40, and 60 feet, and these shelves bear the weight of Zephyros&rsquo;s vast collection of journals (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Floating 10 feet above the floor is a <wc-fetch type=item>navigation orb</wc-fetch> that Zephyros uses to control the movement of the tower.</p>
<p>Zephyros uses magic to move between levels. A 20-foot-diameter hole in the floor allows access to the first level, the floor of which is 100 feet below. A similarly sized hole in the ceiling leads to the aerie.</p>

It contains all the spells that Zephyros has prepared plus the following additional spells: <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane eye</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>fire shield</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>hypnotic pattern</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>mage armor</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>mirror image</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>misty step</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>modify memory</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>shatter</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=spell>slow</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>Zephyros&rsquo;s library contains more than five hundred research journals that he wrote himself. For the past fifty years, Zephyros has been drifting around the Moonshae Isles and cataloging its many wonders, both magical and mundane. Each book weighs 100 pounds, consolidates a month&rsquo;s worth of research, and is worth as much as 250 gp.</p>

<p>The cultists use giant vultures as flying mounts. When they spot the cloud giant&rsquo;s tower, they investigate. The cultists land outside the tower&rsquo;s entrance on the first floor. Zephyros is sleeping on the second floor when they arrive and only becomes aware of visitors if the characters wake him or if combat erupts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the third day of your journey, you spot nine very thin and lightly armored humans riding giant vultures. They land atop the cloud, whereupon the humans dismount. All the riders wear steel helms that cover their eyes and resemble stylized bird heads. One of them is equipped with a shoulder bag adorned with a smiling face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The visitors include two cult fanatic (NE male Illuskan humans) and seven cultist (NE male and female humans of various ethnicities). The cultists try to enter the tower while their nine giant vulture remain outside. The vultures allow only members of the cult to ride them, and they attack anyone else who approaches within 5 feet of them. A character who dons a cultist&rsquo;s costume can, with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Animal Handling) check, fool a giant vulture into allowing him or her to ride it. The giant vulture attacks the character if the check fails.</p>

<p>The cult fanatics are named Amarath and N&rsquo;von. They speak for the rest of the group and claim to speak on behalf of Yan-C-Bin as well. Amarath and N&rsquo;von wish to make contact with a cloud giant and have no interest in dealing with anyone else. If the characters get in the way, the cultists ignore them and call out for master of the tower. If the characters get pushy or turn violent, the cultists attack them.</p>
<p>Amarath carries a magic bag (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;) with an invisible stalker inside it. On his first turn in combat, Amarath releases the invisible stalker and commands it to attack the cult&rsquo;s enemies.</p>

<p>One pinch of the pixie dust can substitute for the material components of any enchantment spell of 3rd level or lower. The pixie dust has other magical effects as well.

Only if the characters are near defeat does the cloud giant cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>mass suggestion</wc-fetch> spell on the cultists and the invisible stalker, urging them to leave at once and never return.</p>
<p>If the characters allow the cultists to speak to Zephyros, they offer him the pouch of pixie dust as a gift and urge him to help Yan-C-Bin &ldquo;return the world to its primordial state, as it was at the dawn of history.&rdquo; The cultists are hazy on how this can be achieved and more interested in a yes or no from the giant.</p>
<p>Zephyros accepts whatever counsel the characters wish to offer. Unless the characters advise him to send away the cultists, Zephyros accepts the cultists' gift and allows them to remain in his tower while he considers their offer. He then retreats to the second floor and casts <wc-fetch type=spell>contact other plane</wc-fetch> to determine the best course of action. If he fails the spell&rsquo;s Intelligence saving throw, he remains catatonic until he finishes a long rest. If the save is successful, he determines with the aid of the spell that the cult&rsquo;s interests are opposed to his own, and politely asks the cultists to leave. The cultists grudgingly concede to his request and take their leave, but not before Amarath chastises the cloud giant wizard for his &ldquo;foolish and shortsighted decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After his business with the cultists is concluded, Zephyros feels bad about keeping their gift and gives the pouch of pixie dust to the characters, believing they might get more use out of it than he will.</p>

The preponderance of giant activity in the North has members of the Lords' Alliance on edge, and their operatives are gathering information while taking steps to curtail the giants' advances.</p>
<p>Any character standing guard outside Zephyros&rsquo;s tower or watching the sky from the tower&rsquo;s aerie spots danger approaching if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A huge silver dragon glides through the clouds, approaching quickly. As it flies closer, you see a number of armored dwarves clutched in its talons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A male adult silver dragon named Clarion owes a favor to Queen Dagnabbet of Mithral Hall and is transporting a Lords' Alliance strike team to Zephyros&rsquo;s tower at her behest. The dragon clutches three shield dwarves in each foreclaw. The dwarves have orders to disable cloud giant strongholds, and they plan to locate and destroy the tower&rsquo;s navigation orb. Neither they nor the dragon know that Zephyros poses no threat to the settlements of the North, nor do they care. They have orders from their queen and a mission to complete, and by Moradin&rsquo;s beard, they intend to succeed!</p>
<p>Characters who spot the silver dragon have 1 minute to prepare for its arrival. Otherwise, all of the tower&rsquo;s inhabitants are startled by the sound of the dragon&rsquo;s flapping wings as he lands on the cloud outside the tower. After dropping off the dwarves, Clarion takes to the air, frightens away the griffons in the tower&rsquo;s aerie, and waits there while the dwarves complete their work.</p>
<p>The shield dwarves are named Daina Ungart, Ildehar Ironfist, Hewen Horn, Voldrik Firehammer, Griswelda Torunn, and Naalt Splintershield. They have the statistics of veterans, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dwarves are lawful good.</li>
<li>Their speed is 25 feet.</li>
<li>They have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</li>
<li>They speak Common and Dwarvish.</li>
<li>They have advantage on saving throws against poison, and they have resistance to poison damage.</li>
<li>They wield battleaxes instead of longswords, and handaxes instead of shortswords (the handaxes deal slashing damage instead of piercing damage).</li>
<li>Each is equipped with a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of gaseous form</wc-fetch>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dwarves quaff their <wc-fetch type=item>potion of gaseous form</wc-fetch> upon landing and make their way into the tower, searching for the <wc-fetch type=item>navigation orb</wc-fetch>. Realizing that the orb isn&rsquo;t on the first floor, they fly up to the second floor. Once the orb is in sight, the dwarves revert to their true forms and attack it. Zephyros does his best to protect the orb without harming any of the dwarves, using spells such as <wc-fetch type=spell>charm person</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>Otiluke&rsquo;s resilient sphere</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=spell>mass suggestion</wc-fetch> to trap or divert them. Meanwhile, the dragon watches the battle from the aerie and tries to neutralize the cloud giant wizard with its paralyzing breath.</p>
<p>The dragon and the dwarves avoid armed conflict with the characters. If the characters kill one or more of the dwarves or deal damage to the dragon, they are accused of conspiring with giants to bring about the downfall of dwarven civilization in the North. The strike team turns on the party, attempting to knock the characters unconscious instead of killing them.</p>

If the player roleplays well and makes a convincing argument, allow the character to use an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, with advantage if the character is a member of the Lords' Alliance, and with disadvantage if one or more members of the strike team are dead. If the check fails, the dwarves say they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t take any chances&rdquo; and press forward with their plan, though the character can try again. If the check succeeds, the dragon and the dwarves call off the attack.</p>
<p>If the dwarves destroy the <wc-fetch type=item>navigation orb</wc-fetch>, the tower is stranded until Zephyros crafts a replacement (which could take months). Rather than strand the characters in his tower, he helps them return to the surface, points them in the right direction, and bids them farewell before returning to his tower to ponder his options.</p>
<p>If the strike team is thwarted or calls off the mission, the dwarves ask Clarion to fly them back to Mithral Hall. If the dwarves are killed, the dragon returns to Mithral Hall alone. Once the Lords' Alliance strike team is gone, Zephyros thanks characters who helped defend the tower, mutters something about dragons under his breath, and carries on as though nothing happened.</p>

<li>Characters who survive the perils of the Dripping Caves advance to 4th level, regardless of how many villagers they rescue.</li>
<li>Characters advance to 5th level after their encounters with the air cultists and the Lords' Alliance strike team.</li>
