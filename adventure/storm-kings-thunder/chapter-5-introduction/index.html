<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>In this chapter, adventurers match wits with Guh, a monstrously fat hill giant chief whose den lies on a branch of the Dessarin River in the hills northeast of Goldenfields. If the characters defeat Guh and obtain her conch of teleportation, they can use it to teleport to Maelstrom, King Hekaton&rsquo;s undersea citadel (see chapter 10, &ldquo;Hold of the Storm Giants&rdquo;). Obtaining the conch is their main goal here. They must be careful not to put the den on alert before eliminating key threats, lest they become overwhelmed by all of Grudd Haug&rsquo;s denizens.</p>

But she&rsquo;s no brighter than a typical hill giant, so her plan is anything but inspired. She plans to eat until she grows so enormous that the gods take notice and show her favor. To her, the biggest giant rules.</p>
<p>Guh&rsquo;s gluttony knows no bounds. She has been feasting for several months and has grown to such a size that she can no longer walk on her own. She spends her time slumped in a wagon with broken axles, surrounded by heaps of stolen loot and crying out for more food.</p>
<h3 id=the-hunt-for-food>
<a href=#the-hunt-for-food class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Hunt for Food</h3><p>Chief Guh has driven away all the other female hill giants in her tribe and taken their husbands as her own. She tasks her many husbands with bringing her food, and she doesn&rsquo;t care how they go about it. Some of her mates form marauding gangs. Others set out on their own, pillaging the countryside for anything edible.</p>
<p>Farmers who live downriver from Grudd Haug have suffered the most from the giants' depredations. The first inkling of trouble was a sudden drop in the river&rsquo;s water level, caused by the dam-like structure of the hill giant den. Not long thereafter, Guh&rsquo;s husbands and their followers began plundering livestock from riverside farms, stealing trees from orchards, knocking down cottages, and snatching up folk who didn&rsquo;t run fast enough.</p>
<p>So far, most of the hill giants' activities have been confined to the region of the Dessarin Valley closest to their den, but as food becomes scarce, Guh&rsquo;s husbands are forced to expand their efforts outward. The villages of Beliard, Womford, and Uluvin, as well as caravans traveling the Iron Road between Womford and Uluvin, are all within the hill giants' threat radius. Meanwhile, the female hill giants exiled by Guh have taken to the hills. They crave the return of their husbands, but they are neither strong enough nor shrewd enough to unseat Guh. They might be convinced to help adventurers overthrow her if it means they get to beat their husbands into submission once more. See the &ldquo;Old Tower&rdquo; section in chapter 3 for an example of a female hill giant outcast.</p>
<h2 id=grudd-haug>
<a href=#grudd-haug class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Grudd Haug</h2><p>The hill giants' den is called Grudd Haug, which means &ldquo;river mound&rdquo; in Giant. Resembling a beaver dam, it straddles a river. The lower level of the den is lodged between two rocky outcroppings and made of piled timber packed with clay and mud, with hollow cavities that resemble caves. Above this piled timber foundation is a mud steading (a house made to giant scale) with a log roof. The structure is an impressive feat of engineering, well beyond the ability of hill giants to fabricate on their own. In fact, Grudd Haug&rsquo;s design is the work of hobgoblin and goblin engineers, assembled with the might of hill giant and ogre laborers. East of the steading is a yard enclosed by a 20-foot-high palisade wall made of logs lashed together with thick twine.</p>

They can also guide a raft upstream or downriver to the hill giant den. In either case, you can make the journey more interesting by adding one or more wilderness encounters appropriate for hill terrain (see the Random Wilderness Encounters table in chapter 3). If Moog the hill giant is with the party, see the &ldquo;Old Tower&rdquo; section in chapter 3 for tips on how to roleplay her once she arrives at Grudd Haug.</p>

</span></p>
<p>If the characters have an airship (see the &ldquo;Airship of a Cult&rdquo; section in chapter 4), they can land it pretty much anywhere outside Grudd Haug. The hobgoblins in the gong tower (see &ldquo;Approaching the Den&rdquo;) spot the airship if it approaches within 1 mile of the stronghold and sound the alarm, putting the entire den on alert (see &ldquo;Denizens&rdquo;). If the characters use the airship&rsquo;s weaponry to attack Grudd Haug, the den&rsquo;s defenders are smart enough to take cover behind walls. Defenders armed with weapons that deal piercing damage target the balloon; those that hurl rocks and use weapons that deal bludgeoning damage target the crew.</p>
<p>The characters might instead approach on a flying mount. They can obtain griffon mounts in Fireshear or hippogriff mounts in Hawk&rsquo;s Nest. Neither settlement is close to Grudd Haug, requiring the characters and their mounts to rest between flights. Characters mounted on hippogriffs can travel 54 miles per day (three 3-hour flights with 1-hour rests in between). Those mounted on griffons can travel 72 miles in the same amount of time. The hobgoblins in the gong tower (see &ldquo;Approaching the Den&rdquo;) spot flying mounts that approach within a quarter mile of the stronghold and sound the alarm, putting the entire den on alert (see &ldquo;Denizens&rdquo;).</p>

Those who come near the den without taking efforts to conceal themselves are spotted by the hobgoblins in the gong tower (<strong>area 8</strong>), who ring the gong to sound the alarm. Characters stand a better chance of infiltrating the den if they approach cautiously, taking advantage of the terrain and using darkness, fog, camouflage, or magic to conceal their movement. Regardless of how the characters approach the den, have them make a group Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the hobgoblins' Wisdom (Perception) check. (Roll once for all the hobgoblins in the tower.) If the characters take precautions, give them advantage on their checks. If they take none, impose disadvantage on their checks.</p>

<p>As soon as trespassers are spotted or combat erupts, the entire den goes on alert. As a consequence, adventurers might find themselves fighting several encounters' worth of creatures at once. Grudd Haug&rsquo;s defenders lack a cohesive defense strategy, but they are many.</p>
<p>If Guh dies, the morale of Grudd Haug&rsquo;s other denizens breaks, and they flee into the wilderness.</p>
<p>All the hill giants in Grudd Haug, with the exception of Guh, are enslaved males. The ogres serve Guh because they are impressed by her size and her determination to rise to the top of the ordning (and, they hope, bring them along with her). The goblinoids have been promised shares of the spoils. The Iceshield orcs haunt the hills and grasslands north of Grudd Haug, near the western edge of the High Forest, and have forged a tenuous alliance with Guh. They are the least loyal of her supporters and don&rsquo;t get along with the goblinoids.</p>

<p>At the end of each hour, roll percentile dice and consult the Grudd Haug Reinforcements table to determine what creatures, if any, appear. Unless otherwise noted, such creatures enter through the stockyard (<strong>area 9</strong>) and go to the feasting hall (<strong>area 2</strong>), to pay homage or deliver food to Chief Guh. There is a 25 percent chance that the creatures have <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> prisoners (unarmed commoner) in tow. If Guh commands the reinforcements to stay, they take up defensive positions in and around the stockyard after confining their prisoners in <strong>area 13</strong>. Otherwise, they leave by the route they came after 20 minutes or so.</p>

Exceptions are noted in the text. Tables, benches, and other room fixtures are typically twice as high, long, and wide as their human-sized equivalents and roughly eight times the weight. Small and Medium creatures can scuttle under and clamber over giant-sized furniture, treating the spaces they occupy as difficult terrain.</p>

Main Entrance</h3><p>A muddy trail leads up to a 40-foot-wide open doorway, parked outside of which is a 30-foot-diameter boulder. North of the boulder is a 60-foot-tall outcropping of rock with a flat, lopped-off peak. This outcropping can be climbed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Standing in the shadows inside the doorway is Hruk, a male hill giant who reeks of dung. A swarm of flies buzzes around him. Hruk carries a sack that contains <wc-roll>1d4+1</wc-roll> mundane items, determined by rolling on the Items in a Giant&rsquo;s Bag table in the introduction.</p>

</span></p>
<p>When Guh feels threatened, she yells at Hruk to move the boulder to block the doorway. The boulder, however, is smaller than the doorway. Small and Medium creatures can move around it unimpeded, while a Large creature can squeeze past the boulder with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A character can push the boulder 10 feet on flat ground by using an action and succeeding on a DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check. A hill giant can do it without the check.</p>

He longs to be reunited with Moog, but dares not defy the mighty Guh. The orcs in <strong>area 4</strong> investigate any disturbance here if they aren&rsquo;t elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id=2-feasting-hall>
<a href=#2-feasting-hall class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>2. Feasting Hall</h3><p>Chief Guh is found here, along with five male hill giant, four ogre, and six goblin. Oil lamps in iron sconces are mounted to thick wooden pillars that support rafters 30 feet from the floor and the roof, which peaks 65 feet overhead. Protruding from the north, west, and south walls is a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-high wooden ledge that the goblins use to get around the room. (The ledge was added after several goblins were crushed underfoot by careless hill giants and ogres.) A wooden ladder climbs up to the ledge, and windows a couple of feet above the ledge let shafts of natural light into the hall.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/SKT/Chief%20Guh.jpg alt="Chief Guh" class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>Eight sturdy but battered wooden tables covered with globs of grease, gnawed bones, empty casks, and scraps of food stand near the north and south walls, while empty ale barrels lie around and underneath them. Refuse covers the dried mud floor, in the middle of which are two 20-foot-diameter circular holes topped with crisscrossing wooden beams held in place by mud cement. The beams are far enough apart that a Medium or smaller creature can slip between them without having to squeeze. A horrible stench rises from the holes, accompanied by the squealing of pigs (see <strong>area 12</strong>).</p>
<p>Chief Guh lies at the west end of the hall, slumped atop a four-wheeled, flatbed wagon that bends and creaks under her great bulk. The wagon&rsquo;s axles are cracked and bowed, its wheels canted inward. Piled around the wagon are bones and other refuse from Guh&rsquo;s recent meals, as well as the treasures she has amassed (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;). Guh weighs more than 20,000 pounds. She can&rsquo;t move, so she keeps her greatclub close by so that she can bop creatures on the noggin. She is a hill giant with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>She has 160 hit points and a speed of 0 feet.</li>
<li>Her Dexterity is 1 (-5), giving her AC 9.</li>
<li>She speaks Common, Giant, and Goblin, though her vocabulary is limited to monosyllabic words.</li>
</ul>
<p>An unarmed goblin, Snert, is stuck in the folds of Guh&rsquo;s flesh. While stuck, the goblin is restrained and unable to speak, and it has total cover. When Guh drops to 0 hit points, Snerk is no longer restrained and tumbles into an unoccupied space next to her, gasping for air. He isn&rsquo;t one of the six goblins guarding the room.</p>
<p>If the characters get this far without raising the alarm and present themselves to Guh, she initially doesn&rsquo;t know what to make of them. Are they servants sent by one of her allies? Are they food? Unless the characters convince Guh that they are more valuable alive than dead, she assumes the latter and orders her mates and minions to beat them to death so that she can feast on their flesh and gnaw on their bones.</p>
<p>If the characters tell Guh a story that explains why they need her <wc-fetch type=item>conch of teleportation</wc-fetch>, she wiggles uncomfortably but refuses to give up the item, instead ordering her servants to attack. If her underlings are defeated, she trades the conch for her life.</p>
<p>The male hill giants are slumped against the tables and walls, tired from having scoured the countryside for food to bring to Guh. The ogres stand ready to serve meals to Guh as they are brought before her. While the ogres and the giants engage in melee combat, the goblins spread out atop the wooden ledge and pepper intruders with arrows. Meanwhile, the wolves in <strong>area 3</strong> begin barking and howling, which puts the rest of the den on alert. If the characters flee, Guh orders her hill giant mates to stay and protect her while any surviving ogres chase after the fleeing characters.</p>
<h4 id=guhs-wagon-throne>
<a href=#guhs-wagon-throne class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Guh&rsquo;s Wagon-Throne</h4><p>Any character who studies Guh&rsquo;s &ldquo;throne&rdquo; can, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check, figure out how to sever a wagon axle with a single hit, causing the wagon bed to fall and spilling Guh onto the floor. Hitting the axle just right requires a successful melee or ranged attack against AC 15 that deals 7 or more damage. Not only does this send Guh tumbling to the floor, but on her next turn she tries to stand up and instead rolls into the nearest pit, breaking through the wooden crossbeams. She falls 30 feet to the floor of <strong>area 12</strong>, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage. She also lands prone and can&rsquo;t get up without assistance. Any creature unfortunate enough to be underneath Guh when she falls must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (<wc-roll>6d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage; the creature is also knocked prone, trapped underneath her, and restrained while trapped in this way. A creature can use an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check on its turn, pulling itself or another creature out from under Guh on a success.</p>
<p>Once Guh is toppled from her &ldquo;throne,&rdquo; characters can spot the valuables hidden therein (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 id=treasure>
<a href=#treasure class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Treasure</h4><p>Guh&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=item>conch of teleportation</wc-fetch> is in the wagon, hidden under her bulk, along with <wc-roll>1d4+1</wc-roll> magic items. Roll on Magic Item Table F in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em> to determine the first item, and on Table B for any other items. Characters can&rsquo;t see or reach these items until Guh is toppled from her throne.</p>
<p>The rest of Guh&rsquo;s treasure lies amid the refuse of her past meals and consists of 5,600 cp, 2,200 sp, 630 ep, and 150 gp; a wooden rocking horse with silver inlay and blue quartz eyes (worth 25 gp); a small wooden chest containing a disguise kit (worth 25 gp); a wooden coffer containing six vials of holy water (worth 25 gp each); a life-size wooden statue of a grinning halfling smoking a golden pipe (worth 25 gp); a battered hat with five carnelians sewn into it (worth 50 gp each); a gold flute (worth 250 gp); a flowerpot carved from jade with images of green dragons (worth 750 gp); and a wooden puppet theater with gold trim, along with gold-stringed puppets wearing bejeweled costumes (worth 2,500 gp).</p>

<p>With the conch, the characters might try to escape the den. The surviving denizens of Grudd Haug pursue fleeing characters until they&rsquo;re out of sight.</p>
<p>A character must attune to the conch before its property can be used, and doing so requires a short rest. Instead of fleeing, the characters can barricade themselves inside the den, using heavy furniture or magic to seal off entrances until a character attunes to the conch.</p>

Wolf Pen</h3><p>A wooden portcullis bars this room. The portcullis can be lifted with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check. Small creatures can squeeze between its bars with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>The room is empty except for a pair of latched wooden gates in the north wall. Beyond the gates are two wolf pens strewn with gnawed bones. Opening or closing a gate requires an action. Two vicious, hungry wolf are locked in each pen. The goblins use them as mounts.</p>

Guard Room</h3><p>This room is tucked behind a mud-splattered curtain. Five orc of the Iceshield tribe sleep on filthy pallets strewn around a large hole in the floor. They awaken to sounds of combat and calls of alarm, and they head to <strong>area 9</strong> if there are no hostile creatures in sight. The hole in the floor is 20 feet in diameter and is topped with crisscrossing wooden beams held in place by mud cement, forming a grate of sorts. The beams are far enough apart that a Medium or smaller creature can slip between them without having to squeeze. A horrible stench rises from the holes, accompanied by the squealing of pigs (see <strong>area 12</strong>).</p>

Kitchen</h3><p>The floor of this filthy kitchen is covered with mud, dirty pots, and leftover food crawling with maggots. In the center of the room, a crackling fire rages in a dome shaped fireplace. Six goblin are tying a halfling to a wooden spit and stoking the fire. They plan to roast the halfling alive and serve it up to Chief Guh. The goblins panic at the sight of interlopers, drop the halfling, and flee to <strong>area 14</strong> by way of the larder (<strong>area 6</strong>).</p>
<p>More dirty pots are piled atop two wooden tables, one of which has a handaxe embedded in one of its legs. Shelves packed with clay dishes and wooden utensils line the walls. A curtained doorway at the end of the north passage leads to the docks. To its left, another curtained doorway leads outside, to the area east <strong>area 8</strong>.</p>

<p>The tied-up entrÃ©e is Roderik Hilltopple (LG male strongheart halfling commoner), an unarmed shepherd who was captured by a hill giant. Though he&rsquo;s grateful to be rescued, he refuses to leave without taking some sheep for his trouble. He asks his liberators to help him free the sheep in the pens (<strong>area 9</strong>).

<p>Beast and humanoid carcasses are often hung here to dry, though the larder is currently empty. A wooden ladder descends through a 20-foot-diameter hole in the floor, leading down 30 feet to <strong>area 14</strong>. The rungs of the ladder are spaced 3 feet apart.

<p>A male hobgoblin calling himself the Watermaster lives here.

A wooden ladder sized for Medium humanoids is lashed to the south side of the tower. Hanging from the tower&rsquo;s rafters is a brass gong with a wooden mallet.</p>
<p>Four hobgoblin stand guard in the tower, facing north, south, east, and west. They have a fairly unobstructed view of the countryside out to a range of 1 mile, though there are hillocks and trees behind which creatures can hide. If the guards spot any unusual creatures approaching the den, or if they come under attack, one of the hobgoblins strikes the gong. The ringing of the gong is loud enough to put the entire den on alert (see the Grudd Haug Roster table for notes on how the den inhabitants react). The ringing of the gong also causes Chief Guh to bellow, &ldquo;Lunch time! Me want food!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A palisade of 20-foot-tall sharpened logs encloses the stockyard, except for an opening to the southeast with a giant boulder outside. The boulder, if rolled into place, is just big enough to fill the opening. A character can push the boulder 10 feet across flat ground by using an action and succeeding on a DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check. A hill giant can do it without needing to make the check.</p>
<p>North of the stockyard, a mud trail climbs a ramp and curves back toward <strong>area 1</strong>. At the bottom of the ramp, at the base of a 60-foot-tall stone bluff, is the entrance of a tunnel that leads north to areas 10 and 11.

The river seeps through a gash in the north wall and forms a stream that cuts across the eastern half of the area before spilling out through a hole in the south wall, tumbling down logs as it goes. A creaky wooden bridge spans the stream at one point. Smaller rivulets also seep into the room and connect to the wider stream, but they are narrow enough to step over. Timber pillars caked in mud support the 30-foot-high ceiling, which has three circular holes cut into it (leading up to areas 2 and 4). Crisscrossing wooden beams cover these holes, though the beams are far enough apart that a Small or Medium creature can fit through them without having to squeeze.</p>

<p>Two 10-foot-high earthen ramps lead down to the chamber&rsquo;s sunken floor, with fences erected around lower tunnels that lead to areas 11 and 14. Scores of fat pigs snort, waddle about, wallow in the mud, and gorge themselves at wooden troughs overflowing with slop. A pig has the statistics of a boar, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pig has AC 10 and 5 (<wc-roll>1d8+1</wc-roll>) hit points.</li>
<li>Its speed is 30 feet.</li>
<li>It lacks the Charge and Relentless features, and it has no effective attacks.</li>
<li>Its challenge rating is 0 (0 XP).</li>
</ul>
<p>Tending the pigs are seven mud-covered bugbear and an ettin named Oinker-Boinker. The bugbears push the pigs around to make sure the stronger ones don&rsquo;t hoard all the food for themselves. They also shovel pig waste into the stream. Oinker-Boinker fills the food troughs and fattens up the pigs before they&rsquo;re served to Guh. The ettin chooses which pigs get slaughtered. Doomed pigs are picked up and taken to <strong>area 14</strong> to die.</p>
<p>Oinker-Boinker and the bugbears prefer melee combat to ranged combat. If the bugbears are subjected to ranged attacks, they use the pigs as cover. If the ettin is taking damage and has no enemies to attack, it retreats to its den (<strong>area 11</strong>) and releases the boars there.</p>

Five wooden cages are arranged about the room. Their doors are situated on top, with heavy rocks placed on them. A creature can use an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to knock off a rock or open a cage door that has a rock pressing down on it. The sound of a rock hitting the cave floor alerts the guards in this area. Three of the five cages contain prisoners destined for Guh&rsquo;s gullet. Two bugbear guard the prisoners.

<p>One cage contains human farmers: a father, a mother, and their three children (a teenage girl and two boys).</p>
<p>A second cage holds an unarmed tribal warrior of the Elk tribe, Gryhark (CN male Uthgardt human). He fights alongside his liberators. If he makes it out of Grudd Haug, he bites into the palm of his hand and tries to smear his blood on the faces of those who freed him. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check realizes that this gesture is a sign of gratitude. Gryhark leaves to return to his tribe whether the characters accept his gratitude or not.</p>
<p>A third cage holds an unarmed prisoner: Emerald Enclave member Ghalvin Dragonmoor (CG male half-elf scout). If freed, he asks the characters to escort him to Goldenfields, so that he can report to the Abbot what he has seen.</p>

<p>Lying atop the easternmost table is the carcass of a slaughtered pig, and looming behind it is Slub, a male hill giant covered head to toe in pig&rsquo;s blood and clutching a handaxe. Before fighting, Slub embeds his axe in the tabletop and picks up his greatclub from the floor.</p>
<p>Slub has a pet otyugh that follows him around like a faithful dog, eating bones and carrion. The otyugh fights to the death to protect the hill giant.</p>
<p>A tunnel in the north wall leads to <strong>area 15</strong>.</p>

It contains a sleeping pallet, a half-empty barrel of pig snouts, a half-empty barrel of vinegar, an old wooden crate, and two empty iron cages with rusty iron doors.

Smithy</h3><p>This freestanding building has mud walls and a 50-foot high ceiling beneath an arching straw roof that is sturdy enough for a Medium or smaller creature to stand on without falling through. The warm interior contains a crude fire pit heaped with hot coals, with red-hot pieces of metal sticking out of it. Leaning against the walls are blacksmithing tools, including tongs and hammers. A barrel of water stands in one corner by the open doorway, and a sleeping pallet rests in the northwest corner.</p>
<p>Grudd Haug&rsquo;s blacksmith is a female hobgoblin who doesn&rsquo;t mind fighting enemies one at a time but retreats or surrenders when faced with overwhelming opposition. When the gong is rung (see <strong>area 8</strong>), she leaves her smithy and heads to the Watermaster&rsquo;s quarters (<strong>area 7</strong>). Assisting the hobgoblin are two goblin, who hide behind the barrel when an alarm sounds. If intruders enter the smithy, the hidden goblins make Dexterity (Stealth) checks to slip out through the open doorway. Their checks are contested by the Wisdom (Perception) scores of creatures within sight of the doorway. If they are cornered, the goblins surrender in the hope that their lives will be spared. They know the layout and defenses of Grudd Haug, and they share that information if they think it will improve their chances of survival.</p>

The characters might have a few issues to resolve before using the conch, such as escorting Ghalvin Dragonmoor to Goldenfields. The characters should advance to 9th level before moving on to chapter 10, &ldquo;Hold of the Storm Giants.&rdquo;</p>
