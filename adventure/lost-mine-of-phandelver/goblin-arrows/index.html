<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>The adventure begins as the player characters are escorting a wagon full of provisions and supplies from Neverwinter to Phandalin. The journey takes them south along the High Road to the Triboar Trail, which heads east (as shown on the overland map). When they&rsquo;re a half-day&rsquo;s march from Phandalin, they run into trouble with goblin raiders from the Cragmaw tribe.</p>
<p>Read the boxed text when you&rsquo;re ready to start. If you create a different adventure hook, skip to the second paragraph and adjust the details as necessary, ignoring the information about driving the wagon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found &ldquo;something big,&rdquo; and that he&rsquo;d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen&rsquo;s Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to &ldquo;take care of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you&rsquo;ve just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before continuing with the adventure, take a few minutes to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven&rsquo;t done so already.</li>
<li>Ask the players to think about how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player&rsquo;s character get out of a tough scrape. This exercise is a great opportunity for the players to contribute to the adventure&rsquo;s backstory.</li>
<li>Ask the players to give you the party&rsquo;s marching order and how their characters are traveling. Who&rsquo;s in front, and who&rsquo;s bringing up the rear? If the characters are escorting Gundren&rsquo;s wagonload of supplies, then one or two characters need to be driving the wagon. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead, as they like.</li>
</ul>

Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding the reins, the oxen stop where they are.</p>
<p>The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re ready, continue with the &ldquo;Goblin Ambush&rdquo; section.</p>
<h2 id=goblin-ambush>
<a href=#goblin-ambush class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Goblin Ambush</h2><p>Read the following boxed text to start the encounter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are using the &ldquo;Meet Me in Phandalin&rdquo; adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They&rsquo;ve been dead about a day, and it&rsquo;s clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four goblin are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.</p>
<p>This will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the goblin stat block in appendix B. Since the goblins are hiding, you&rsquo;ll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.</li>
<li>Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party cannot surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins, rolling once for all of them. Roll a d20, add the goblins' Stealth skill modifier (+6) to the roll, and compare the result to the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins' check result is surprised and loses his or her turn during the first round of combat (see &ldquo;Surprise&rdquo; in the rulebook).</li>
<li>Use the initiative rules in the rulebook to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone&rsquo;s initiative count in the margins of this book or on a separate piece of paper.</li>
<li>When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins' stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. For more information on what the goblins can do on their turn, see chapter 2, &ldquo;Combat,&rdquo; in the rulebook.</li>
<li>When three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=developments>
<a href=#developments class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Developments</h4><p>In the unlikely event that the goblins defeat the adventurers, they leave them unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the Cragmaw hideout. The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen&rsquo;s Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins' trail.</p>
<p>The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows (see the &ldquo;What the Goblins Know&rdquo; sidebar on page 8). A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way (see the &ldquo;Goblin Trail&rdquo; section).</p>
<p>The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip ahead to part 2, &ldquo;Phandalin.&rdquo; Elmar Barthen (the owner of Barthen&rsquo;s Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived. He recounts the goblin troubles and suggests that the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster (see page 16) can provide more information on the goblin attacks.</p>

<h3 id=goblin-trail>
<a href=#goblin-trail class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Goblin Trail</h3><p>After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.</p>
<p>The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.</p>
<p>The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party&rsquo;s marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.</p>
<p><strong>Snare.</strong> About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare&rsquo;s cord. (See the appendix in the rulebook for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn&rsquo;t carefully lowered down takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Pit.</strong> Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn&rsquo;t detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The pit&rsquo;s walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.</p>

When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character 75 XP. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.</p>

The Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.</p>
<p>The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.</p>

<p>A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren&rsquo;t meant to see-hence the need for secrecy.</p>
<p>Maps are best used to show multiroom lairs and other locations that have many places to explore. Therefore, not every location needs a map.</p>
<p>When the players arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a separate piece of graph paper, copying what&rsquo;s on your map while omitting details as appropriate.</p>

<li>Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Following the goblins' trail, you come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream.</p>

This is a goblin guard post, though the goblins here are bored and inattentive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the area-including a pair of goblins lurking there right now!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two goblin are stationed here. If the goblins notice intruders in <strong>area 1</strong>, they open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by surprise. If the goblins don&rsquo;t notice the adventurers in <strong>area 1</strong>, they spot them when they splash across the stream, and neither side is surprised.</p>
<p>Characters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts.

<blockquote>
<p>Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where three wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf&rsquo;s chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three wolf are confined here. They can&rsquo;t reach targets standing on the steps, but all three attack any creature except a goblin that moves into the room (see the &ldquo;Developments&rdquo; section). Goblins in nearby caves ignore the sounds of fighting wolves, since they constantly snap and snarl at each other.</p>
<p>A character who tries to calm the animals can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the wolves allow the character to move throughout the room. If the wolves are given food, the DC drops to 10.</p>

At the base of the fissure is rubbish that&rsquo;s been discarded through the opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the base of the shaft.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters using light or darkvision to look farther up the passage spot the bridge at <strong>area 5</strong>. Add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who can see the bridge in <strong>area 5</strong> might also notice the goblin guarding the bridge. Doing so requires a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin&rsquo;s Dexterity (Stealth) check result.</p>
<p>The goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don&rsquo;t use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in <strong>area 7</strong> to release a flood (see the &ldquo;Flood!&rdquo; section of <strong>area 5</strong>). The goblin moves undetected if its Dexterity (Stealth) check exceeds the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of any character who might notice its movements.</p>

<p>The ledge between the two escarpments is fragile. Any weight in excess of 100 pounds loosens the whole mass and sends it tumbling down to the east. Any creature on the ledge when it falls must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

<blockquote>
<p>The stream passage continues up beyond another set of uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters didn&rsquo;t spot the bridge while navigating <strong>area 4</strong>, they spot it now. Add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A rickety bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels that are 20 feet above the stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One goblin stands watch on the bridge. It is hiding, and characters can spot it by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin&rsquo;s Dexterity (Stealth) check. This guard is lazy and inattentive. If no characters are using light sources, each character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the goblin&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to creep by without being noticed.</p>

It&rsquo;s possible to climb up the cavern wails from the lower passage to the bridge. The 20-foot-high walls are rough but slick with spray, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.</p>
<p>The bridge has an Armor Class (AC) of 5 and 10 hit points. If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone (see &ldquo;Being Prone&rdquo; in the rulebook). Those who succeed hold onto the bridge and must climb it to safety.</p>

In the round after the goblins in <strong>area 7</strong> are signaled by the lookout in <strong>area 5</strong>, they start knocking away the supports. In the following round on the goblins' initiative count, a water surge pours from <strong>area 7</strong> down to <strong>area 1</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge surge of rushing water pours down from above!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flood threatens all creatures in the tunnel. (Creatures on the bridge at <strong>area 5</strong> are out of danger, as are any characters successfully climbing the cavern walls.) Any creature within 10 feet of the disused passage at <strong>area 4</strong> or the steps leading up to <strong>area 3</strong> can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. A creature that fails to get out of the way can attempt a DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on. On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and washed down to <strong>area 1</strong>, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage along the way.</p>
<p>The goblins in <strong>area 7</strong> can release a second flood by opening the second pool, but they don&rsquo;t do this unless the goblin on the bridge tells them to. The goblin on the bridge waits to see if the first flood got rid of all the intruders before calling for the second to be released.</p>

Goblin Den</h3><p>The Cragmaw raiders stationed in the hideout use this area as a common room and barracks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six goblin inhabit this den, and one of them is a leader with 12 hit points. The five ordinary goblins tend the cooking fire in the lower (northern) part of the cave near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper (southern) part of the cave.</p>
<p>Sildar Hallwinter, a human warrior, is held prisoner in this chamber. He is securely bound on the southern ledge of the cavern. The goblins have been beating and tormenting him, so he is weak and at 1 hit point.</p>
<p>The goblin leader, Yeemik, is second-in-command of the whole hideout. If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. &ldquo;Truce, or this human dies!&rdquo; he shouts.</p>
<p>Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in <strong>area 8</strong>, promising to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear&rsquo;s head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn&rsquo;t trust the goblin, and he&rsquo;s right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain.</p>
<p>If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues with the fight. Sildar takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies (see &ldquo;Damage, Healing, and Dying&rdquo; in the rulebook).</p>

He is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelands.</p>
<p>Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accompany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords' Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to Iarno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren Rockseeker, Tharden, and Nundro Rockseeker) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver&rsquo;s Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the &ldquo;Background&rdquo; section to the players at this time.)</li>
<li>Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn&rsquo;t know who or what the Black Spider is.</li>
<li>Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn&rsquo;t know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn&rsquo;t occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle&rsquo;s location. See the &ldquo;What the Goblins Know&rdquo; sidebar on page 8.)</li>
<li>Sildar&rsquo;s contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it&rsquo;s the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they&rsquo;ll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.</p>

Here are some tips to help you run an NPC party member:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the characters make the important decisions. They are the protagonists of the adventure. If the characters ask an NPC party member for advice or direction, remember that NPCs make mistakes too.</li>
<li>An NPC won&rsquo;t deliberately put himself or herself in harm&rsquo;s way unless there&rsquo;s a good reason to do so.</li>
<li>An NPC won&rsquo;t treat all party members the same way, which can create some fun friction. As an NPC gets to know the characters, think about which characters the NPC likes most and which characters the NPC likes least, and let those likes and dislikes affect how the NPC interacts with the various party members.</li>
<li>In a combat encounter, keep the NPC&rsquo;s actions simple and straightforward. Also, look for things that the NPC can do besides fighting. For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or help barricade a door.</li>
<li>If an NPC contributes greatly to the party&rsquo;s success in a battle, the NPC should receive an equal share of the XP earned for the encounter. (The characters receive less XP as a consequence.)</li>
<li>NPCs have their own lives and goals. Consequently, an NPC should remain with the party only as long as makes sense for those goals.</li>

Twin Pools Cave</h3><p>If the goblins have drained either pool to flood the passage, adjust the following boxed text accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This cavern is half filled with two large pools of water. A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three goblin guard this cave. If the goblin in <strong>area 5</strong> spotted the characters and warned the goblins here, they are ready for trouble. The noise of the waterfall means that the creatures in <strong>area 8</strong> can&rsquo;t hear any fighting that takes place here, and vice versa. Therefore, as soon as a fight breaks out here, one goblin flees to <strong>area 8</strong> to warn Klarg.</p>

<p>Klarg the bugbear shares this cave with his mangy pet wolf, Ripper, and two goblin. The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest.

If they return the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see part 2, &ldquo;Phandalin&rdquo;), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company.</p>
<p>In addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains 600 cp, 110 sp, two potions of healing, and a jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp). The frog statuette is small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch.</p>

The adventurers should have plenty of reasons to visit the town:</p>
<p>If the characters began with the &ldquo;Meet Me in Phandalin&rdquo; adventure hook, they can be paid by Barthen&rsquo;s Provisions for delivering the wagonload of supplies. If the characters rescued Sildar Hallwinter the wounded warrior would appreciate an escort to Phandalin (and will pay 50 gp for the service). Details contained within the characters' backgrounds might prompt them to seek out specific NPCs in the town.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that players might decide to do something different, such as striking out in search of Cragmaw Castle (in part 3 of the adventure). If that&rsquo;s the case, skip ahead to that section.</p>

Award each character 275 XP. This should provide enough XP for the characters to attain 2nd level.</p>
<p>Level advancement rules for characters are provided on loose sheets included in this set. Hand these sheets to the players, and allow them to advance their characters to 2nd level before continuing the adventure. Make sure they&rsquo;ve recorded their XP totals on their character sheets.</p>
<p>In the next part of the adventure, you&rsquo;ll award XP differently. The characters will earn experience points based on the monsters and traps they overcome, the NPCs they interact with, and the goals they accomplish.</p>
<p>If the adventurers come up with a nonviolent way to neutralize the threat that a monster poses, award them experience points as if they had defeated it.</p>
