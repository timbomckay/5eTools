<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>In this part of the adventure, the characters follow up on existing leads and lines of inquiry. They can&rsquo;t learn much more in Phandalin, so they need to set out into the forests and hills surrounding the town to uncover the larger plots they are caught up in. The characters are not required to visit all the locations in this section. Depending on which NPCs the characters met and which quests or clues they picked up, some or all the following information might be known to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sister Garaele wants the characters to seek out the banshee Agatha in the ruined town of Conybery and ask her about Bowgentle&rsquo;s spellbook.</li>
<li>Daran Edermath wants the characters to find out who is lurking near the ruins at Old Owl Well.</li>
<li>Quelline Alderleaf has suggested that the characters go to the ruined town of Thundertree and consult with the druid Reidoth, who might know the whereabouts of Cragmaw Castle, Wave Echo Cave, or both.</li>
<li>Townmaster Harbin Wester wants the characters to seek out an orc encampment near Wyvern Tor and chase the orcs away from the area.</li>
<li>Sildar Hallwinter wants the characters to find Cragmaw Castle, search for Gundren Rockseeker, rescue the dwarf, and retrieve his map.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these possible quests has its own section in this part of the adventure. The characters can remain in Phandalin long enough to rest up and purchase supplies. When they&rsquo;re done, have them pick a storyline to investigate, then set out for the appropriate destination.</p>

The area gains its name from an old trail that runs from the distant town of Triboar to the east, winding westward about one hundred miles through the abandoned village of Conyberry, then running north of Phandalin on its way to the High Road along the coast.</p>
<p>Describe the party&rsquo;s overland travels as vividly as you like, but keep the story moving. &ldquo;You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest&rdquo; is far less evocative and memorable than, &ldquo;A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but otherwise you see nothing out of the ordinary.&rdquo;</p>

As can be seen on the regional map on page 5, some of these areas are a good forty to fifty miles apart, requiring several days of marching overland to travel to the next adventure site.</p>

The characters must rest for eight hours per day, with the remaining six hours consisting of making and breaking camp, preparing meals, and a little bit, of foraging or hunting as the opportunity permits.</p>

When the party camps, ask which characters are on watch. This information is important if the party encounters something dangerous.</p>
<p>The Triboar Trail is not safe. As the adventurers travel throughout this area, they might stumble across hungry beasts, greedy bandits, or vicious monsters. Check for encounters once during the day and once at night by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Roll a d12 and consult the Wilderness Encounters table to determine what the party meets.</p>

The Triboar Trail runs right through the abandoned town, providing an easy landmark for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. From the ruins of Conyberry, an old trail leads northwest into Neverwinter Wood. Agatha&rsquo;s lair is a few miles outside town.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters exercise caution and remember what they&rsquo;ve come for, they will be able to speak with the banshee. When the characters enter the shelter, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A home of sorts is sheltered within the dome of woven branches. It is sparsely furnished with chests, shelves, a table, and a reclined couch, all of it old and of elven craft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agatha senses the characters' intrusion and manifests shortly after they enter her home.</p>

<p>The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A cold, pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking on the form of a female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now. &ldquo;Foolish mortals,&rdquo; she snarls. &ldquo;What do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters are rude, disrespectful, or threatening, Agatha scowls and disappears. She does not attack them, nor does she return if the characters call out to her.</p>

The player whose character takes the lead in speaking with the banshee makes the check. If that player roleplays the encounter well, allow him or her to make the check with advantage. If any character has Sister Garaele&rsquo;s silver comb and presents it to Agatha as a gift, the check is automatically successful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ghostly figure smiles with cold amusement. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I know that you seek many things. Ask me one question, and I will give you an answer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters ask about Bowgentle&rsquo;s spellbook, Agatha tells them that she traded the book to a necromancer named Tsernoth from the city of Iriaebor more than a hundred years ago. She does not know what became of the book afterward. Her answer is truthful, and it is all the information Sister Garaele needs for the Harpers to resume their search.</p>
<p>The characters might instead choose to ask Agatha about something else-for example, the location of Cragmaw Castle, the location of Wave Echo Cave, the identity of the Black Spider, or Hamun Kost&rsquo;s question about Old Owl Well (see that section). Agatha is well informed and a capable diviner, so she can answer almost any single question pertaining to the adventure that the characters think to ask. However, the banshee answers only one question, so the characters should choose it carefully.</p>

In the tower&rsquo;s courtyard stands an old well that still delivers clean, fresh water. Old Owl Well lies in the wild and rugged hills south of the Triboar Trail. The site is relatively easy to find, and any NPC in Phandalin can provide directions to the ruins.</p>
<p>Recently, prospectors in the area have noted that someone has set up a campsite at Old Owl Well, and that undead guardians have been posted to keep intruders out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills. The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tent has been set up in the middle of the courtyard, but no one is in sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ruins are currently occupied by a mage who is busy exploring the site in the hope of gleaning arcane lore left behind by its builders. The characters can enter the site from any direction, either following old footpaths or scrambling up the slope and finding a gap in the surrounding walls of rubble.</p>
<p>Twelve zombie lurk inside the crumbled shell of the old watchtower and can&rsquo;t be seen from outside. However, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher smells a deathly odor wafting from the tower&rsquo;s direction. When characters approach the tower or the tent, the zombies shamble out of the tower.</p>
<p>If a battle erupts, Hamun Kost, the evil mage, emerges from his tent and asks,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Kost is a stout, red-robed figure with sallow skin, a shaved scalp, and a black tattoo on his forehead. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes Kost&rsquo;s tattoo as a necromantic symbol. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check verifies the garb as that usual for Thay, a land far to the east where wizards pattern their flesh with tattoos. The tattoo on the head represents a wizard&rsquo;s school of magic. Kost&rsquo;s school is necromancy.</p>
<p>If any character attempts to talk to Kost, even by calling out a greeting or answering his questions during combat, he temporarily calls off his zombies. The Red Wizard is not particularly aggressive, and he is willing to strike a deal that advances his interests at the same time it helps the characters.</p>
<p>Kost stays tight-lipped about the reason for his presence in the region. He is, however, willing to provide information the party needs if it does a favor for him. If the characters give Kost some indication of what they want, he shares one or both of these requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>He wants the orcs at Wyvern Tor removed, since they have scouted out his camp and seem inclined to cause trouble.</li>
<li>He wants to ask a question of Agatha the banshee: &ldquo;What is the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well?&rdquo; Kost won&rsquo;t risk the banshee&rsquo;s anger, but the characters could ask the question for him. (Agatha knows the name: Arthindol.)</li>

Once, this was a prosperous community on the outskirts of the forest, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Then thirty years ago, the eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.</p>
<p>Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long-with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see <strong>area 4</strong>) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Cultists have also arrived recently (see <strong>area 13</strong>) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see <strong>area 7</strong>).</p>
<p>As the party approaches the ruins, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush. Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather. Other buildings appear more or less intact. The whole place is eerily silent.</p>
<p>A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads: &ldquo;DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reidoth placed the sign to discourage bands of treasure seekers from stirring up the monsters in the area.</p>

<p>Intact buildings are rundown, ramshackle stone cottages that are otherwise still standing. Their wooden doors are swollen and require a successful DC 10 Strength check to force open. The windows of any intact building are 2 feet wide and covered by wooden shutters containing 6-inch wide arrow slits. Creatures on one side of an arrow slit gain three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side (see &ldquo;Cover&rdquo; in the rulebook).

<p>Four ash zombie (see the &ldquo;Ash Zombies&rdquo; sidebar) lurk in the shadows in this building, slumped against the walls or under the bar. When living creatures enter, the zombies groan and stir, slowly climbing to their feet (spending half their speed to do so-see the &ldquo;Being Prone&rdquo; section in the rulebook). They pursue any characters they see, attacking until destroyed.</p>
<p>The eastern half of the building is the old common room, while the western portion held the kitchens and the brewer&rsquo;s vats. Huge wooden tuns stand to the west, and a faint smell of yeast still permeates the air. The ale is long gone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This small house appears to be in better condition than the ruined and dilapidated structures nearby. The doors are reinforced with heavy iron bands, and thick shutters protect the windows.</p>
<p>Reidoth is a gaunt, white-bearded human who doesn&rsquo;t use two words when one word will do. Though he receives very few visitors, he is reasonably hospitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reidoth is adept at staying away from the ash zombies that overrun the village, as well as avoiding the area&rsquo;s mutated plants. He knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and he suspects that someone is hiding out on the eastern side of town-he&rsquo;s seen &ldquo;folk in black masks and cloaks&rdquo; (the cultists) skulking around. However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower (<strong>area 7</strong>) since the last time he was here. He warns the characters of all these threats, and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.</p>

He is a member of the Emerald Enclave, a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order while rooting out troublesome threats. The enclave works to restore and preserve the natural order by keeping the elemental forces of the world in check, preventing civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another, and helping others survive the perils of the wilds. The goblins are a threat to the delicate balance.</p>
<p>If the characters ask Reidoth about Wave Echo Cave, he will not divulge its location but will offer to guide the party there in exchange for a favor: he wants them to chase off the dragon in <strong>area 7</strong>. If they succeed, Reidoth will honor his part of the agreement but will not accompany the party inside the mine.</p>
<p>If the characters attack him for any reason, Reidoth transforms into a gray squirrel and scurries out of the cottage through a crack in the wall. He vanishes into the woods, then waits for the hostile characters to leave. His watch post contains nothing of value.</p>

<p>At an intersection near the middle of the village, a narrow lane winds up the steep hillside to the north. Directly to the south is a ruined building that might have been a store or workshop. Webs stretch across the lane, from the building to the trees on the north side of the road.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two giant spider hide on the inner walls in this ruined building, so they are not visible from outside. Trailing lines from the webs in the lane allow the spiders to sense when prey is moving through the webs, at which point they nimbly scuttle over the wall and attack. The alert spiders surprise any character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score is less than 17.</p>

They are difficult terrain, and a creature trying to move through them must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, the creature is restrained in the webs (see the rulebook for the effects of being restrained). A snared creature can take an action each round to attempt to break free with a DC 12 Strength check, or it can try to cut its way free by using a light weapon that deals slashing damage. The webs have AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage (see &ldquo;Damage Resistance and Vulnerability&rdquo; in the rulebook for how vulnerability works).</p>
<p>Going around the webs is difficult because of the thickets on the north side of the road. Going around the ruined building to the south leads to the twig blights in <strong>area 5</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the top of the hill stands a round tower with a cottage attached. Both are in good condition, although half of the tower&rsquo;s roof is gone. A door leads into the cottage, and several arrow-slit windows are visible in the tower. You can&rsquo;t help but notice an eerie quiet in the area and a strange, acrid smell in the air.</p>
<p>The corpses of two hideous giant spiders are sprawled near the edge of the pathway, apparently dragged there. Their bloated bodies are puckered and blistered, and appear to have been mauled by a large animal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A young green dragon named Venomfang has recently claimed the tower, having passed over Thundertree while searching Neverwinter Wood for a suitable lair. The giant spider corpses are the former residents of the tower, killed by the dragon after it tore its way through the roof. Since then, Venomfang has been laying low.</p>

<p>The dragon has barely noticed the most interesting item in its hoard. Beneath the coins is a rusty old battleaxe of dwarven manufacture. Runes in Dwarvish on the axe head read, &ldquo;Hew,&rdquo; and the rust is misleading. Hew is a +1 battleaxe that deals maximum damage when the wielder hits a plant creature or an object made of wood.

<p>Two ash zombie (see the &ldquo;Ash Zombies&rdquo; sidebar) are slumped on the floor. When the characters enter, the monsters climb to their feet (spending half their speed to do so-see the &ldquo;Being Prone&rdquo; section in chapter 2 of the rulebook). Then they attack. When the zombies have caught sight of the characters, they pursue them no matter where they go.</p>
<p>A variety of old tools-tongs, bellows, hammers, and a pair of iron anvils-are scattered around the interior of this building.</p>

One lane leads southeast, another heads southwest around the hill in the middle of the town, and a third way meanders north. In the middle of the square, leaning to one side ever so slightly, is a weathered wooden statue of a warrior clutching a spear and shield.</p>

<p>The leaning statue is ten feet tall, including the base. It depicts an old hero of Neverwinter named Palien, who supposedly defeated several monsters in Neverwinter Wood when Thundertree was first founded.

<p>The barracks appears to have weathered the years better than most buildings in town. Its rooftop features a simple battlement, and arrow-slit windows confirm that it was built to serve as a small keep in times of emergency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five ash zombie (see the &ldquo;Ash Zombies&rdquo; sidebar) lurk within this building. Former members of the garrison, they still wear the remnants of rusted mail and soldiers' surcoats. These scraps of armor do not improve their Armor Class, however. The zombies animate and attack if any living creature disturbs their rest.</p>
<p>The interior of the building still contains furnishings, and the main room has a ladder leading through a trapdoor to the roof. The chamber to the north contains two double bunks, while the chamber to the south has three double bunks, providing quarters for ten soldiers altogether. To the northwest of the main area of the barracks was a kitchen and pantry, now containing piles of well-rotted sacks and barrels that once held salted meat. All the foodstuffs have long since been devoured by vermin.</p>

People traveling along the Triboar Trail in the vicinity of Conyberry catch glimpses of Wyvern Tor to the south as they go. The tor was formerly the home of a large and dangerous nest of wyverns, but a band of bold adventurers dealt with the monsters years ago. Though the wyverns never returned, other creatures lair here from time to time. Wyvern Tor&rsquo;s current squatters include a band of orcs and their ogre ally.</p>
<p>The orcs are scouts of the Many Arrows tribe. These orcs often roam into the more civilized areas of the North, spying out human settlements, waylaying travelers, and looting and plundering as opportunities present themselves. Stories of new settlers near Phandalin and renewed traffic along the old Triboar Trail drew this band to the area.

<p>The faint smell of smoke hangs on the air as you ascend a rugged ridge on the lower slopes of the hill. Fifty yards away, a cave mouth opens up at the bottom of a ravine. Hunkered down by a boulder twenty yards outside the cave, keeping watch, is a single orc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters can quietly and expeditiously take out the lone orc, they have a chance to surprise the orcs in the cave. If the sentry spots the characters sneaking up, or if it is not silenced during the surprise round, the orc retreats back to the cave to warn the others.</p>
<p>The marauders in the cave include Brughor Axe-Biter (an orc with 30 hit points), six ordinary orc, and a filthy ogre named Gog. Gog fights until slain, while the orcs fight until Brughor is killed, at which point any remaining orcs flee.</p>

<p>Cragmaw Castle is not a goblin construction, nor is that the structure&rsquo;s original name. Raised by a talented wizard-noble of old Phalorm, an ancient realm that once controlled much of the North, the stronghold consists of seven overlapping towers; however, its upper levels have long since collapsed to heaps of crumbling masonry. Only the ground floor is still sound enough to be habitable.</p>

Round towers loom over the entranceway, with dark arrow slits looking down on the terrace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No monsters dwell here, but the goblin sentries in <strong>area 3</strong> are supposed to be keeping watch. They glance only occasionally out of the arrow slits, however, so characters who move quietly might be able to creep past them. Have each character make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.

For example, they might don the scarlet cloaks of the Redbrands and claim to be emissaries sent by Iarno &ldquo;Glasstaff&rdquo; Albrek, the Redbrand leader, to meet with King Grol. A good DM rewards this kind of clever thinking by giving the characters a chance to succeed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay if the characters circumvent combat and talk their way past castle defenders. Both the Cragmaw tribe and the Redbrands work for the Black Spider, so the goblinoids aren&rsquo;t likely to attack the party if they claim to be working in the Black Spider&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>If the characters try to perpetrate a deception as a group, have them each make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the monsters' Wisdom (Insight) checks, and give the characters advantage on their checks if the deception is particularly well planned or roleplayed. If at least one of the characters win the contest, the deception is a success. As the party makes its way deeper into the castle, additional checks might be required, at your discretion.</p>

<p>If the goblin sentries in <strong>area 3</strong> raised the alarm, the goblins and hobgoblins in areas 4 and 6 come running out of the north and south doors at the same time. They attack from both directions, trying to overwhelm the adventurers and drive them out of the castle.</p>

Spotting the tripwire requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of at least 20, or a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check if characters are actively searching for traps in the area. Once spotted, the tripwire is easily avoided and disarmed (no ability check required).</p>
<p>Any creature that walks over or through the rubble without avoiding the tripwire triggers a cave-in of wooden beams and heavy stones. (The area of the collapse is marked on the map.) Any creature in the area when the trap triggers must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage from the falling rubble (half as much damage on a successful save).

<p>Though the stores here are not edible by human standards, the goblins can tolerate them when fresher food isn&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>One small cask is filled with an exceptional dwarven brandy, which the goblins overlooked because of its size. The cask contains the equivalent of twenty glasses. A character who imbibes a glass of brandy regains 1 hit point, but a character who drinks two glasses within 1 hour becomes poisoned for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Four plain straw pallets and bedrolls are lined up on the floor of this barracks. Brackets on the walls hold a number of weapons-spears, swords, morningstars, and more. The north wall shows signs of damage, but the floor is swept clean of rubble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four hobgoblin are quartered in this room. Because their goblin neighbors are always getting into fights, they don&rsquo;t pay attention to noise in areas 2 or 3. However, they are quick to defend their tower if any intruders appear, or to respond to an alarm raised by the goblin sentries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The western portion of this large hall ends in a wall of rubble, but the remainder is still intact. This must once have been the castle&rsquo;s banquet hall, with a soaring ceiling twenty-five feet high. Two large wooden tables with plain benches stand in the middle of the room, and a brass brazier full of glowing coals is tucked into one corner. Dirty dishes, half-full stewpots, moldy heels of bread, and gnawed bones cover the tables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hall holds seven miserable goblin and their leaderâ€”a fat, cantankerous goblin with 12 hit points named Yegg. Yegg is the chief cook for the Cragmaws, and he viciously bullies his unwilling assistants as they go about the work of putting food on the tribe&rsquo;s table. If Yegg is killed, any goblins left alive flee to the east or west, avoiding the north door because of the trap in <strong>area 2</strong>.</p>

Dark Hall</h3><p>Even by day, this area has no exterior light. The boxed text assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This high, narrow hall looks as if it might have been part of a chapel or shrine at one time. Angelic figures are sculpted along the room&rsquo;s upper reaches, looking down on the floor below. To the north, heavy curtains block a matching pair of archways. Between the archways is a cracked but ornately carved stone brazier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chamber contains a grick, the special pet of the goblin Lhupo (<strong>area 9</strong>). The grick like to climb up to a ledge hidden in the shadows of the statuary in the higher reaches of the room. It quietly observes intruders that enter the area before dropping down to strike. Compare the grick&rsquo;s Dexterity (Stealth) check to the characters' Wisdom (Perception) checks (or their passive scores) to determine who among them is surprised. The grick knows that goblins are not to be eaten unless Lhupo says so. The rest of the Cragmaws are terrified of Lhupo&rsquo;s pet and hurry through this room, preferably in twos or threes.</p>
<p>Any cleric who examines the chapel&rsquo;s decor can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check to identify the deities that were once revered here: Oghma (god of knowledge), Mystra (goddess of magic), Lathander (god of dawn), and Tymora (goddess of luck). This is an obvious sign that the builders of the castle were human.</p>

<p>This chamber occupies the northern tower of the castle. A stone altar stands in the middle of the room, covered with bloodstained black cloth. Golden ritual implementsâ€”a chalice, a knife, and a censer-are carefully arranged on top of the altar. Two archways to the south are covered with heavy curtains.</p>

<p>This shrine is home to Lhupo (a goblin with 12 hit points) and two ordinary goblin that serve as his &ldquo;acolytes.&rdquo; They all wear filthy robes over their armor, but none of them possess divine powers (although Lhupo claims to hear Maglubiyet speaking to him). If the goblins heard the characters fighting the grick in <strong>area 8</strong>, they hide behind the altar and attempt to surprise the characters. Otherwise, all three goblins are kneeling before the altar, praying to their evil god.</p>

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a footpath leading up to the hidden entrance. If the characters are actively searching the outside of the castle for a hidden entrance, they can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the canvas &ldquo;door.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tower has almost completely collapsed, although the ground floor still has a little open space. Rotting crates and ancient barrels show that provisions were once stored here. A heavy curtain blocks a crumbling area to the south, and an intact door leads east. To the north, a short passage through the rubble ends before a screen of canvas.</p>

<p>Two hobgoblin stand guard in this room. They are smart, tough, and loyal to King Grol. At the start of combat, one hobgoblin runs to warn the king in <strong>area 14</strong>, then returns 2 rounds later to rejoin the fray.</p>
<p>This area was once a parlor for the castle&rsquo;s human occupants, though its rotted furnishings were broken up by the Cragmaws and used for firewood.</p>

When the bar is lifted, the creature in the room awakens and lets out a terrible roar.</p>
<p>The arrow slits here are shuttered, leaving the room dark. The boxed text assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The upper floors of this tower have collapsed to create a hollow silo at least thirty feet high, and the upper reaches of the room are lost in shadows. Dust, rubble, and broken glass cover the floor, and old worktables and bookshelves lie strewn to the south. In the middle of the room is a hulking beast that looks like a mangy bear with an owl&rsquo;s head. It rears up and roars when it sees you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cragmaws have captured an owlbear and confined it to this tower. The room is kept dark to keep the beast calm, but King Grol doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with it yet. If a character throws it fresh meat, the owlbear devours the food. Otherwise, it attacks the first creature it sees in the doorway.</p>
<p>This room was once a library and workshop, but nothing of its original contents remains intact.</p>

King&rsquo;s Quarters</h3><p>Any character who listens at the door hears two voices in a heated discussionâ€”a loud, growling voice demanding payment for something, and a silky smooth reply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chamber has been set up as a crude living space, with thick furs thrown on the floor to serve as carpets, old trophies hanging on the walls, a large bed to the north, and a brazier of coals burning brightly. A round table with several chairs stands to the south near the door. Near the table, on the floor, is an unconscious dwarf who looks badly beaten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>King Grol is a fierce old bugbear with 45 hit points. He rules the Cragmaws through pure intimidation. Age has stooped his shoulders and hunched his back, but he remains surprisingly agile and strong. He is demanding and vindictive, and no Cragmaw dares to cross him.</p>
<p>Grol is attended by Snarl, a wolf with 18 hit points, and a doppelganger disguised as a female drow. The doppelganger, Vyerith, is a messenger from the Black Spider, come to collect Gundren Rockseeker and the map of Wave Echo Cave from King Grol. Grol wants to sell the map instead of surrendering it. and he and the drow are negotiating a price. Vyerith first wants to question Gundren to find out if anyone else knows the location of the mine. Then the doppelganger intends to kill the dwarf and destroy the map.</p>
<p>If the villains have been warned that an attack is imminent, Vyerith hides behind the door to the northeast, leaving it open a crack and hoping to attack an intruder from the rear. Grol holds Gundren hostage, ready to kill the dwarf if the characters don&rsquo;t back off.</p>

He knows that someone called the Black Spider orchestrated his capture and hopes that the characters stop the villain. Upon returning to Phandalin, Gundren offers the characters 25 gp each for their assistance and promises the party a 10 percent share of the mine&rsquo;s wealth once his operation there is up and running.</p>
<p>Whether the characters sought the information from Agatha or Reidoth, negotiated with Hamun Kost, or recovered Gundren and his map from Cragmaw Castle, they now know the location of Wave Echo Cave. The only thing left for them to do is seek out the old dwarven delve and discover for themselves who the Black Spider is, and why he&rsquo;s so interested in the Lost Mine of Phandelver.</p>
