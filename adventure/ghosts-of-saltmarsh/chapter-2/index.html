<p>Four miles east of Saltmarsh, just inland of the old coast road, stands a haunted house. Until twenty years ago, it had been the residence of an aged alchemist of sinister reputation. Even then, locals avoided the house because of its owner&rsquo;s mysterious activities. Now, two decades after the unexplained disappearance of its occupant, the house has taken on an even greater air of evil and mystery.</p>
<p>Dilapidated and long abandoned, the house presents an unwholesome appearance. Those hardy souls who have infrequently sought entry (pursuing rumors of a secret hoard of alchemical gold) all returned with naught save grim tales of decaying chambers presided over by monstrous perils. Indeed, such is the reputation of the house that the fields around it, though prime agricultural land, remain untended and rank with weeds.</p>
<p>This adventure is designed for four to six 1st-level characters. If the characters complete both portions, &ldquo;<strong>area The Haunted House</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>area The Sea Ghost</strong>,&rdquo; they are likely to reach 3rd level.</p>

Brown and Don Turnbull. It was a revelation at the time, marking the first appearance in a D&D adventure of a haunted house and a raid on a sailing ship. It also set the tone for TSR UK&rsquo;s subsequent output, which often featured strong, central narratives that challenged players to take a creative approach to problem solving. They usually included multiple, smaller locations to explore, lending a sense of variety to a single adventure.</p>

Now, not even the bravest of the area&rsquo;s denizens dare to approach the house, let alone enter it. If the characters seek anyone in Saltmarsh who has been in the place, they initially find no one. Persistent questioning of the town&rsquo;s inhabitants makes them frightened and apprehensive but does not yield any concrete information.</p>
<p>If the characters pursue their questioning, they might (at your discretion) find an aged poacher who, after suitable inducement (money, ale, or both), confesses to having wandered in the back door of the house a couple of years before, hoping to acquire some food. Encouraged by the prospect of free wine in the cellar, he started to descend the stairs, heard ghastly shrieks and piercing wails, and ran, frightened out of his wits. He knows where the back door is and also noticed a nearby well. He can vaguely describe the kitchen, the scullery, and the passage that leads to them from the back door, but he knows nothing else about the layout of the place.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his memory of what frightened him has become exaggerated over the months, so he is likely to tell the party that a horde of ghosts came up the stairs to the scullery, or maybe it was a vampire with a swarm of rats. He discovered soon after his escapade that the telling of his tale, in ever more lurid detail, was an easy means of obtaining free ale foisted on him by appreciative listeners. Recently, however, none have asked him to tell the tale, so once his tongue is loosened, he is eager to restore some of his lost prestige. Apart from alerting adventurers to sinister and grave dangers of his own invention and telling them a little about the layout of the house, he provides no accurate or useful information.</p>

It is the shore base for a band of smugglers led by a wizard named Sanbalet. The eerie lights seen at night by onlookers are the smugglers' signals to a ship out at sea. The unearthly shrieks and other sounds are caused by <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spells strategically placed in the building. The smugglers, during their three years of successful operation, have through these tactics frightened away all local attempts at investigating their hideout.</p>
<p>It is paramount that the characters are given no obvious clues that would lead them to believe the house is not haunted; they must deduce the truth for themselves or simply stumble upon it.</p>

The ship is away from the house when the characters explore it, though evidence of its moorings can be discovered in the secret caverns below. The ship comes into play in the second part of this adventure.</p>

If they become aware of the characters' intrusion, they cooperate to locate and destroy the invaders.</p>
<p>The following members of the gang are currently in the house, skulking about in the cellar and the adjoining caverns: Sanbalet (see appendix C), two Hobgoblin, four Bandit, and four Scout. All the bandits and scouts are humans of neutral evil alignment. Before being alerted to the characters' incursion the smugglers are dispersed in the cellar and caverns beneath the house (as indicated in the area descriptions).</p>

Sanbalet and three of his gang (a hobgoblin, a bandit, and a scout) immediately retreat to <strong>area areas 27</strong> and <strong>area 28</strong> to protect the smuggled goods.</p>
<p>The others break into two groups. Two Bandit and a scout wait in <strong>area area 21</strong> to ambush intruders. The second hobgoblin keeps watch at area 30, but runs to reinforce Sanbalet in <strong>area area 27</strong> if a fight breaks out there. The remaining members of the gang, two scouts and a bandit, try to ambush intruders. They make Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) checks to close in on the party. If two of them are slain, the survivor tries to flee back to <strong>area area 21</strong>.</p>

They most highly value gold, drink, and the freedom that comes with pursuing a life of crime. They have no concern for the implications of their actions, which could be a precursor to war.</p>
<p>The smugglers currently run weapons for a clan of lizardfolk living near Saltmarsh whose queen, Othokent, is preparing her clan for battle against a terrible enemy: the sahuagin.</p>
<p>The peaceful town of Saltmarsh knows nothing of the coming war, or the fact that a sahuagin invasion threatens them as much as the lizardfolk do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Haunted House&rdquo; likely plays out in the following sequence.</p>
<p>The characters arrive in the town of Saltmarsh and begin to hear tales of the haunted house, after which they might seek more information about the house and its current state. If you decide so, they can speak to the poacher mentioned in the &ldquo;<strong>area Background</strong>&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>The characters set out to explore the house, where they meet its crawling and hissing residents. Awaiting them is Ned, a deceptive NPC who tries to prevent the characters from uncovering the smuggling operation. Whether the characters discover the smugglers or the smugglers initiate an attack on the party, a confrontation with the gang is inevitable, especially if the characters are thorough in their exploration. Ned reveals his true colors at an opportune moment.</p>
<p>The caverns and contraband below the house wait to be discovered. Access to the sea suggests the use of a large ship, though such a vessel is not to be found. The first part of the adventure concludes when the characters return to Saltmarsh with the truth and are rewarded for their work.</p>
<p>The town elders offer to hire the party to board and commandeer the smugglers' ship when it returns to its secret port. That event sets in motion &ldquo;The Sea Ghost,&rdquo; which likely unfolds in the following sequence.</p>
<p>The characters discover a document that explains the signaling system used by the smugglers to indicate the ship has arrived; by deciphering and sending the proper return signal, they can put the crew at ease. By force or deception, the party boards the <em>Sea Ghost</em> and attempts to seize control. During this raid, the party encounters a captured sea elf named Oceanus and a trio of lizardfolk warriors. The adventure concludes with signs that the lizardfolk are preparing for a raid, presumably on the town of Saltmarshâ€”though the truth, as outlined in the &ldquo;<strong>area Portents of War</strong>&rdquo; section, is far more ominous.</p>

It is situated some twenty miles from two larger towns: Burle, to the northwest, and Seaton, along the coast to the east.</p>
<p>Here are suggestions for where you can place this adventure in other campaign settings.</p>
<p><strong>Eberron:</strong> Even to the pioneering folk of Q&rsquo;barra, Saltmarsh is a frontier town. The lean-tos and shanties sprawl in the steaming eastern deltas of the Basura Swamp, and their inhabitants do their best to keep out of the affairs of the lizardfolk in the interior. An elf illusionist bearing the Mark of House Phiarlan leads the smugglers and seems bent on stirring up trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Forgotten Realms:</strong> Midway between Waterdeep and Neverwinter, the town of Saltmarsh and its hardy inhabitants endure both winter storms and the Mere of Dead Men to the south. Because of the politics churning in Thornhold on the far side of the marsh, help is often slow to come, and so the townsfolk have become quite self-reliant. The smugglers could be from Luskan, and their selling weapons to lizardfolk could be connected to deeper goals than simply lining their pockets.</p>
<p><strong>Mystara:</strong> Saltmarsh stands on the border between the Grand Duchy of Karameikos and the Five Shires, just inside the edge of the Blight Marsh. The smugglers who use the haunted house as their base might be Hin pirates, or at the very least count some halflings among the crew, keen to avoid the authorities at Rollstone Keep up the coast.</p>

The merchant sent a local thug, Ned Shakeshaft, to the house to await the characters in a remote bedroom on the first floor.</p>
<p>Ned pretends to have been knocked out, gagged, bound, and left to die by unseen attackers. After being &ldquo;rescued&rdquo; by the characters, he aims to sow dissent, cause accidents, and otherwise make trouble as they explore the house.</p>

Retellings of the messenger&rsquo;s tale have varied over the years, with the most popular versions suggesting that the alchemist had discovered a method of transforming base metals into gold.</p>

<p>The road to the house winds through the rocky coastal terrain, often offering a view of the sea below. Low clouds press upon you; occasional patches of sunlight appear out over the water. A stiff wind blows in off the waves, carrying the briny stink of churning salt water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The house is located four miles up the coast from Saltmarsh and is accessible by an old road. Curious townsfolk might follow the party for part of their journey. These escorts engage the characters in conversation, ask about their intentions, and repeat the same rumors and stories heard in town. As soon as the house comes into view, the townsfolk grow grim-faced and retreat toward Saltmarsh.</p>

<p>The decrepit house sits on the highest ground in the area. Around it, a stone wall has crumbled in many places, exposing the interior grounds. An ornate metal gate lies open at the end of the road, swaying slightly in the wind. Wild flora grows throughout the inner yard, but all the years cannot hide the evidence of a well-tended garden that once sat here. Near the house, the rotted wooden roof of a water well rises out of the tall grass.</p>

Now, a few broken gardening tools and a tangle of weeds are all that remain. A single rosebush near the gate has overgrown the wall and choked out most of the other plants. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check discovers that something large has made a burrow under the rosebush.</p>
<p>A family of four Giant Weasel resides in the thorny mass, having dug out a home under the wall. The weasels are highly aggressive and try to ambush the characters as they investigate the garden. Given the opportunity, they&rsquo;ll try to grapple the smallest character and drag them toward their den.</p>

<p>The well shaft, which descends 20 feet, still contains clean water. Fed by an aquifer; the well offers no access to the house nor the caverns below it. If the characters illuminate the shaft while looking down, they see the glint of coins through the shallow water at the bottom. A Medium or smaller creature can climb down the well, using the rocky walls as natural handholds.</p>
<p>Two Giant Poisonous Snake make their homes in the crumbled and crevice-ridden walls of the well shaft. They emerge and strike at anything that descends into the well. They also emerge if the characters linger near the well while investigating it.</p>

Fireplaces (with chimneys too narrow to climb) show no signs of recent use.</p>
<p>All house corridors are 5 feet wide and 10 feet high; all ceilings are 10 feet high except for the attic level where, because of the sloping roof, the height ranges from l foot at the sides to 15 feet in the center.</p>
<p>All doors are 5 feet wide and 7 feet high, of normal wood construction; all are closed but unlocked (with the exception of <strong>area area 15</strong>) and easy to open. Most of the window panes are broken, and all are easy to open.</p>

<p>The front door opens onto a musty, dirty entrance hall. To your left, a corridor leads into the west wing of the house. The walls are bare and bits of smashed furniture lie upon the floor. Ahead of you, another corridor leads toward the rear of the house.</p>
<p>A staircase on the eastern wall climbs to the next story, reaching it at a balcony that overlooks the entrance hall along its north and west sides; the stairs appear safe to climb, though the balcony rail is broken in several places. Under the stairs at the north end of the hall, a third corridor leads east.</p>

<p>The stairs show considerable wear and creak ominously when tread upon but remain strong enough to support anyone climbing to the second floor.</p>
<p>A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check finds two sets of recently made humanoid tracks.

<p>This room was once a library, with bookshelves around the walls. Most of the shelves are broken, and in many places they have come away from the wall. The few shelves still intact are empty, but a pile of books rests in the southwest corner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fourteen books in the heap untidily thrown into the corner are covered with cobwebs, vermin droppings, and harmless mold. All are partially ruined but are still legible. Most of the books are dull (histories, collections of romantic poems, and so forth), but three are quite noteworthy. These three books bear clear titles on their spines:</p>
<p><em>The Magical Properties of Gemstones</em> by the archmage Tenser</p>
<p><em>The Magical Properties of Herbs and Flowers</em> by the archmage Tenser</p>
<p><em>The Metaphysics of Mathematics</em> by the mage Nystul</p>
<p>Inside the third volume lies a piece of parchment torn from a larger sheet, containing a few lines of handwritten text in the Common tongue. Dampness has spoiled it so that only two words are legible: &ldquo;beyond skeletons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The central drawer is locked and can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

He entered through the back door and had only reached the kitchen when he was attacked from behind and knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>. He awoke some hours agoâ€”bound, gagged, and stripped of his possessionsâ€”in this room. He did not see his attackers nor has he heard any sounds in the house. Now he would like to be released and to join the characters in their mission.</p>
<p>Neither Ned nor his merchant mentor are fools, and they have given some thought to preparing this storyâ€”it is not possible for the characters to discern Ned&rsquo;s true motives. Indeed, to add verisimilitude to the story, Ned has a lump on the back of his head (inflicted, with sadistic delight, by the merchant before Ned left his company).</p>
<p><strong>What Ned Wants:</strong> Ned wants to manipulate the characters into abandoning their mission. He tries to achieve this by playing up the dangers of the place and causing accidents as they explore. The closer the characters get to discovering the truth about the smugglers, the more desperate he becomes. When it became clear he can&rsquo;t warn the characters off, he&rsquo;ll try to ambush them with a poisoned weapon during a fight against other creatures.</p>

Cellar</h4><p>If the party makes a lot of noise while exploring area 20, the smuggler here has already vanished through the secret door.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This torchlit chamber was once a large cellar, but it has since been converted into living quarters. Ten crude beds stand along the south wall, each with a wooden locker at its foot.</p>
<p>A long wooden trestle table ringed by rickety stools dominates the center of the room. Metal cutlery, cups, and dirty plates sit atop the table.</p>
<p>A cookstove is installed near the table, and evidence of recently cooked meals sits in pots atop it. A large ham hangs from a loop of twine near the stove.</p>
<p>A sturdy set of stairs leads to a trapdoor in the ceiling above. There are two wooden doors in the east side of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters avoided making undue noise in area 20, a single smuggler (bandit) is scrubbing pots in a washbasin near the stove. He tries to flee through the secret door as soon as the characters appear. Otherwise, if the smugglers have been alerted to the party&rsquo;s presence, two Bandit and a scout are here and ready to fight.</p>
<p>Without a smuggler to point the way, someone must make a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check to find the secret door. The door is hidden behind some shelves that slide away to reveal the opening, which leads to the caverns.</p>
<p>When the party approaches the doors in the east end of the room, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The door to your left appears normal, but the one ahead has a wooden bar across it, held in brackets on the frame and the door itself. The word &ldquo;DANGER&rdquo; is scrawled on that door in the Common tongue using chalk.</p>

<p>Unlike the barracks, this small room holds comfortable furnishings and appears to be well cared for.</p>
<p>A comfortable-looking bed in the northwest corner has a wooden locker at its foot.</p>
<p>A small wooden table stands against the east wall, with a padded leather chair beside it. On the table, a brass three-branch candlestick with three burning candles provides the room with bright light. The candles, though not fresh, are far from spent.</p>
<p>Under the table is a small wooden box and an unlit bullseye lantern with a movable shutter over the lens.</p>
<p>On a shelf above the table sit three books. In the northeast corner is a closed wooden wardrobe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters have avoided alerting the smugglers to their presence, Sanbalet (see appendix C) is in his quarters. Otherwise, this room is vacant.</p>
<p>Sanbalet&rsquo;s books consists of the following volumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A volume of erotic poetry, fully illustrated</li>
<li>A naval almanac listing tide times for the area of coast around Saltmarsh (a total of one hundred miles of coastline is covered)</li>
<li>A treatise concerning the demigod Iuz and its minions</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the third book is a sheet of parchment featuring a few simple words and phrases in the Common tongue and their equivalents in Goblin. The words include &ldquo;stop,&rdquo; &ldquo;fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;lift,&rdquo; &ldquo;come,&rdquo; and so forthâ€”key words used by Sanbalet to instruct his hobgoblin mercenaries.</p>

The passage that runs north of <strong>area areas 25</strong> and <strong>area 26</strong> and the interior of <strong>area areas 27</strong>, <strong>area 28</strong>, and <strong>area 29</strong> are well-lit by torches set in crude brackets on the walls. <strong>area Areas 25</strong> and <strong>area 26</strong> are dark. <strong>area Area 30</strong> is open to daylight. The walls are slimy and the floors are moist, though the smugglers have laid matting in places to make them more easily passable.</p>
<p>All these passages and caverns are natural, though there are signs of worked stone here and there; such evidence is found on the stairs leading from the secret door and in places where narrow passages were widened.</p>
<p>It is likely that the characters have dealt with members of Sanbalet&rsquo;s gang before entering the caverns. The following area descriptions assume that the smugglers have responded (see &ldquo;<strong>area Smugglers on Alert</strong>&rdquo; in the &ldquo;<strong>area Background</strong>&rdquo; section), so that Sanbalet and a few of the smugglers await the characters in <strong>area area 27</strong> and <strong>area 28</strong>.</p>
<p>If the smugglers are caught off guard, most of them are scattered throughout the caverns. Be sure to place them in a way that does not overwhelm the characters, but once combat begins in the caverns, it likely won&rsquo;t stop until the gang is entirely dealt with. If Sanbalet is slain, consider having any remaining smugglers flee.</p>
<p>The following locations are identified on map 2.2.</p>

<p>Two patches of green slime (see &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide) hang at a point on the ceiling roughly halfway between the two passage mouths. They drop on characters (or smugglers) who pass below, landing with a distinctively soggy slap.</p>

Storage Cavern</h4><blockquote>
<p>This cavern, like the passage leading to it, is well lit by torches held in simple iron brackets around the walls. You can see five small bolts of cloth stacked against the wall to your left, and to your right are eight small casks in a neat row.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the primary storage chamber for Sanbalet&rsquo;s smuggling operation, and the likely place from which he and his gang mount a defense.</p>
<p>If an alarm has not been raised, two Bandit and a scout are here, stealing drinks from the store of brandy.</p>
<p>If the smugglers have been alerted, Sanbalet (see appendix C and the following sidebar), one hobgoblin, one scout, and one bandit defend this room. Sanbalet stays clear of the melee, taking cover behind the casks in the southeast corner. The hobgoblin and the bandit try to prevent the characters from entering the room, while the scout hangs back to fire its ranged weapon.</p>

<p>A lone bandit is here if the smugglers aren&rsquo;t on alert.</p>
<p>If either of the <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spells has been triggered, a lone hobgoblin keeps watch here (guarding against an approach by sea) and joins the fray in <strong>area area 27</strong> if it hears sounds of combat.</p>

<p>The passage leads into a cave that opens directly to the sea. The tide is out at present, and there is little water in the cave, but there is an obvious high-water mark three feet above the floor. Pulled up onto the sloping cave floor is a small boat, perhaps large enough for eight people, with oars, a step-down mast, and a neatly furled sail. A rope tied to the bow is being held down by a large boulder that serves as an anchor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters have avoided triggering either of the <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spells, the two hobgoblin smugglers are standing guard here.</p>
<p>There are no items of value in this area except the jolly boat, which might fetch as much as 100 gp. Since bolts of silk and casks of brandy are cumbersome, the characters can use this boat to transport the contraband to Saltmarsh.</p>

<p>A few days after their triumphant return from the destruction of the smugglers' ring at the haunted house, the characters are hastily summoned to an emergency meeting of the Saltmarsh Town Council. Here it is explained to them that, though the land-based operation of the smuggling ring has been quashed, there must be a seagoing vessel by which the contraband was originally conveyed, and this is still at large. The council, fearful that any surviving smugglers could seek to reestablish their operation from some other base, asks the characters to apprehend this vessel and put an end, once and for all, to the smuggling.</p>
<p>A reward of 400 gp is offered to the characters for the successful conclusion of the mission.</p>

Since the last consignment was offloaded only a short while ago, another one is not expected for some timeâ€”perhaps during the next new moon, which begins in about two weeks' time.</p>
<p>The council arranges for members of the town guard to patrol the potential rendezvous points each night for the next two weeks in case the smugglers return earlier than expected. If the ship is sighted, the council is unwilling to risk the lives of volunteers by ordering them to take the ship and its crew by force. As soon as an approaching vessel is spotted, the council expects the characters to perform the actual task of boarding.</p>
<p>Once the characters accept the undertaking, the council puts a small fishing boat at their disposal and provides them with any reasonable amount of nonmagical equipment that they feel they require. The boat is large enough to accommodate the entire party plus two. The council also provides the services of two members of the guard to sail the boat for them when needed. They are not willing to board the <em>Sea Ghost</em> with the characters, though they defend themselves and the fishing boat if it is attacked.</p>
<h3 id=the-signaling-system>
<a href=#the-signaling-system class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Signaling System</h3><p>If the characters discovered the bullseye lantern and the parchment in <strong>area area 22</strong> of the haunted house, they have a big clue to how the smugglers communicate. You might require the characters to make a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check to determine how the system worksâ€”although certain facts are not written on the parchment. Alternatively, you can allow the characters to experiment with sending signals when the ship comes back.</p>
<p>The signaling system utilizes the bullseye lantern to communicate the following messages by combining long and short flashes:</p>
<p><strong>Longâ€“shortâ€“shortâ€“short</strong>: &ldquo;Is it safe?&rdquo; (The ship initiates the exchange with this signal.)</p>
<p><strong>Shortâ€“longâ€“shortâ€“long</strong>: &ldquo;Everything safe.&rdquo; (The smugglers respond with this signal.)</p>
<p><strong>Longâ€“longâ€“long</strong>: &ldquo;Ready to unload; come to the ship.&rdquo; (The ship confirms a reply with this signal.)</p>
<p>The arrangement calls for someone aboard the ship to flash the first signal. The shore party replies by flashing the second signal, after which the third signal flashes from the ship. It drops anchor and waits for the arrival of a boat from shore. A small group of smugglers approaches the ship in a rowboat. When it arrives, the ship sends a boat in the other direction. These two vessels alternate in transferring contraband between the ship and the shore, with one of them remaining in the shore cave at the end of the operation.</p>
<p>It has been arranged (though this does not appear on the parchment) for the first signal to be repeated every 10 minutes for an hour. If the ship gets no response, it is assumed that there is some delay and the <em>Sea Ghost</em> sails away, returning the next night.</p>
<p>The smugglers will drop anchor if the characters send any kind of return signal to the shipâ€”not necessarily the correct one. The crew of the <em>Sea Ghost</em> is accustomed to seeing an improper signal from time to time, because the gang on the shore often operates the lantern clumsily. Just in case something has gone awry, however, the ship&rsquo;s crew will be on alert when the characters make their approach.</p>

If, for example, it is arranged that the guard members, once they have seen the ship, row ashore and pick the characters up (say in the cave below the haunted house), that takes 15 or 20 minutes. The characters then board the fishing boat, which is rowed out toward the ship. The journey to the ship takes 30 minutes (20 minutes with more than two rowing), but if the boat is to approach the <em>Sea Ghost</em> from the seaward side, another 5 minutes should be added. The ship is lying broadside to the coastline, the starboard side facing landward. If the characters approach it from this side, they are automatically seen when within 20 feet, even if they approach silently and without light.</p>
<p>If the characters approach silently from the port side, without using light sources, they will be totally unobservedâ€”the smugglers on deck are watching the coast from the starboard side and do not see or hear intruders who don&rsquo;t give themselves away. Thus, whether the alarm is raised or not depends on a number of factors: from which direction the boat approaches the ship, whether the watchers on the ship are alerted to possible danger (a previous incorrect response to the signal), and whether the characters have taken all precautions to conceal their approach.</p>
<p>Between the extremes outlined above (automatic detection of a direct approach or no detection of a silent and dark approach from the seaward side), you must judge the circumstances, decide on the probability of detection, and determine the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Burning:</strong> The <em>Sea Ghost</em> is mainly of wooden construction, so fire always presents a hazard. The ship could, with some difficulty, be set ablaze and burned down to the waterline. The vessel will not ignite readily, for its hull, rigging, spars, and sails are all damp with sea water.</p>
<p>Deliberate attempts to set the ship ablaze can be undertaken only while aboard it. This involves the use of at least two flasks of oil applied to 2 cubic feet of dry, combustible material such as sacking, cloth, wool, or wood kindling, which is then set aflame. Bolts of silk soaked in brandy make excellent combustibles and do not require oil to be ignited. Use your discretion if the ship catches fire, but assume it burns to the waterline within 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Holing:</strong> Attempts to hole the ship and sink it require the use of axes or similar implements applied with vigor. This undertaking takes 5 minutes, but the noise alerts the smugglers. Two of them are sent to investigate and raise the alarm. The rest of the crew rapidly converge on the area and attack any intruders. If the hole is completed, the ship takes on water and sinks after an hour if the hole remains unrepaired.</p>

Access to it is provided by a rope ladder whose lower end drops near the hatch on the main deck. The crow&rsquo;s nest is an open, wooden platform, 10 feet square with 3-foot-high wooden walls. Opening a 2-foot-square hatch in the floor lets out the rope ladder that descends to the main deck.</p>
<p>A single crew member (bandit) occupies this area when the party approaches the ship. The crew member looks toward the house and awaits a signal. There is no chance that he detects the characters' approach to the ship or their boarding of the ship if the others on board below fail to do soâ€”his gaze is fixed at a higher level.</p>
<p>If those on the deck below detect the characters' intrusion, the crew member&rsquo;s attention is attracted (even if his colleagues forget to alert him), and he descends with all speed to the deck to assist his mates. Otherwise, he is oblivious to the characters' intrusion unless someone climbs the rope ladder or the rigging to approach his position; he always detects such an approach when the climber is 15 feet below him, investigating and attacking if circumstances warrant it.</p>

For instance, they might say they are new recruits to the smuggling gang, unaccustomed to the codes and thus made a mistake with the signaling, or something of a similar nature.</p>
<p>If the story is reasonably convincing, allow the characters to make a DC 14 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check. If the check is successful, they are believed up to the point when the first three characters get aboard by means of a rope ladder lowered for them. Once the characters' approach is detected, the entire crew attempts to repel the characters with the utmost vigor while getting their vessel under way.</p>

<li>The hull of the ship provides many handholds for climbing but is also very slippery. Climbing the hull without a rope or other device requires a successful DC 14 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. On a failed check, the climber falls into the water.</li>

Their minimum requirement, in this case, is 100 gp to disclose the whereabouts of the secret cache of weapons and the fact they were to deliver these arms to the lizardfolk. They do not know the exact location of the rendezvous point, only that it is about ten miles or so along the coast west of the haunted house, near the mouth of a small river.

Lizardfolk Quarters</h4><blockquote>
<p>A distinct odor about this room reminds you of a marsh or a swampâ€”not fetid, not oppressive, but certainly noticeable.</p>
<p>In the center of the area is a wood table, bolted to the deck. On the table sits a silver jug half full of a red liquid; with it are three pewter mugs. Around the table are set three upright wooden chairs, and an unlit hooded lantern hangs from the ceiling above.</p>
<p>In the gloom, you can see three hammocksâ€”one at each end of the cabin slung between the bulkhead and one of the ship&rsquo;s ribs, and the third hanging across the corner of the cabin from next to the aft door to the central bulkhead. Each hammock is occupied by a scaled figure.</p>
<p>A small chest or box of some sort lies under the most forward hammock. There appear to be weapons under each of the hammocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three lizardfolk warriors occupy the hammocks. The chest and its contents are their property. The lizardfolk were provided by the chieftain of their clan to help ensure that the smuggled weapons in <strong>area area 15</strong> make it to their lair. When they become aware of the characters, they initially assume they are smugglers and treat them as such, demanding in a combination of Draconic and broken Common to know when the weapons will be delivered to their kinfolk.</p>
<p>A pseudodragon named Bimz sleeps in a small nest behind the chest. It is the companion of one of the lizardfolk and joins in the combat to defend its master.</p>
<p>Combat in this small room is hampered by its size and low ceilings. Melee attacks made with two-handed weapons have disadvantage in this room.</p>

It continues to fight only if pursued. After the remaining lizardfolk are dealt with, Bimz chooses one character and bonds with that individual. Bimz prefers to bond with a party member that did not directly attack it, is good-aligned, and also did not directly attack its lizardfolk master. If no character meets all those conditions, the one who met the most conditions will suffice. Alternatively, the characters can engage in a contest of Charisma checks (highest wins) to determine whom Bimz bonds with.</p>

<p>A polished wood table stands in the center of the room, bolted to the deck. On the table is a silver bowl containing an assortment of fruit, a silver carafe half full of a light red liquid, and a silver goblet. Set at the table are two upright wooden chairs and a padded leather chair.</p>
<p>On the deck toward the stern is a wooden, brass-bound chest. Beside it is a pair of highly polished black leather boots. From the center of the ceiling, over the table, hangs an unlit hooded lantern.</p>

<p>This cabin is clean, and its furniture in good repair.</p>
<p>A single bunk, made up with bed linen, has its head against the bulkhead running along the centerline of the ship next to a wooden partition squaring off the corner near the main deck.</p>
<p>A writing desk is set against the hull toward the stern; it has a drawer on each side and three trays on the top. Also on the desktop, just in front of the trays, is an inkpot, two quill pens, a small knife, and a pewter container that resembles a pepper pot. Against the desk is set an upright wooden chair, and beside it is a wooden, brass-bound chest.</p>
<p>Against the hull on the starboard side is a padded leather couch. In front of it, a bearskin rug lies on the deck, while beneath the couch can be seen a large metal box. An unlit hooded lantern hangs from the ceiling.</p>

<p>A gray cloak (with no special properties) hangs on a peg on the back of the door. The wooden chest beside the desk is unlocked. It contains items of clothing, including a well-worn, comfortable pair of slippers.</p>

The last contains several letters of a personal and intimate nature from three different women in three different ports (each of whom is under the misapprehension that she is Mrs. Sigurd &ldquo;Snake Eyes&rdquo;), and a curious, semiliterate document requesting a further supply of ironware &ldquo;as per previous consignments and at the agreed terms.&rdquo; The signature here is in the form of a pictograph and shows a lizard with forked tongue extended.</p>
<p>This last document is a request from the lizardfolk for more weapons. You should exercise caution here in not making the document too explicitâ€”the lizardfolk would not want the document to fall into the wrong hands and have concealed as much of the real meaning of the request as possibleâ€”for instance, using words like &ldquo;goods&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two desk drawers are locked; a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools can open one drawer. The key to both drawers is in Captain Sigurd&rsquo;s belt pouch.</p>
<p>The first drawer contains two <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Healing</wc-fetch>, a dose of <wc-fetch type=item>antitoxin (vial)</wc-fetch>, and the key that unlocks the chains holding Oceanus in <strong>area area 14</strong>.</p>
<p>The second drawer contains seven maps of various sea and coastal localities, prepared by professional cartographers. Beneath these is another map, crudely drawn. This map indicates that the rendezvous point with the lizardfolk is at a small promontory beside a river in the tidal marshes, ten miles southwest of the town of Saltmarsh.</p>

<p>Various unpleasant odors of humanoid occupation compete for recognition here. These crew quarters fill the entire forward part of this deck.</p>
<p>A companionway staircase leads up from a point about six feet from the bulkhead. Near it, more to starboard, is a door.</p>
<p>Around the perimeter of the cabin, slung between hooks on the bulkhead and on supporting poles, are eight hammocks. Judging from the way in which they hang, the hammocks seem to be unoccupied at present. Beneath each hammock is a brass-bound wooden sea chestâ€”most are closed, but two have open lids and appear to contain clothes.</p>
<p>In the center of the cabin stands a long, plain wooden table with a bench along each of its longer sides. They all appear to be bolted to the deck in an attempt to keep everything in place.</p>
<p>The table is stained and cluttered and has an untidy pile of dirty tin plates and cups roughly stacked in a large tin bucket below it. Over the table, hanging from the ceiling, is an unlit hooded lantern.</p>
<p>Against the starboard side, an area has been curtained off by cheap, dirty cloth hangings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The curtained area contains two large tin buckets standing side by side on the floor. Both are empty, but they are stained and dirty and emit a foul smell.</p>
<p>The sea chests contain clothes and other personal effects. The garments are all stained, grubby, and in poor condition. Of minor interest among the remaining items are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pack of well-used, greasy playing cards (examination reveals the deck has two aces of spades)</li>
<li>Two sets of dice, one of them loaded</li>

<p>A lantern hanging from the ceiling, positioned just forward of the main mast, provides bright illumination. The characters can see the plain wooden hatch that allows access to the bilge, forward of the mast.</p>
<p>Four crew members (Bandit) under the supervision of Foul Frithoff (pirate bosun; see appendix C) are wandering about the hold, securing the cargo and taking inventory. They chat about all manner of depraved conquests as they do. Once they become aware of the party, they attack immediately.</p>

<p>This cabin occupies half the stern section on this deck, with one bulkhead running along the centerline of the ship. Along this bulkhead, leading up in the direction of the bow, is an enclosed companionway. At its foot, a door in the central bulkhead leads to the other part of the stern. On this door hangs a dark blue cloak.</p>
<p>A single bunk, the bed linen heaped in a pile, is set against the hull. At its foot is a brass-bound wooden sea chest, its lid closed. Under the bunk is a brass box, also closed.</p>
<p>In the center of the cabin, a plain wooden table is bolted to the deck. On it are two books, one open and propped up against the other. Beside the table is a wooden chair. Hanging from the ceiling over the table is an unlit hooded lantern.</p>
<p>Just aft of the hook that holds the lantern is a hatch measuring three feet on a side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cloak has no special properties and no significant value.</p>

<p>A dark, cramped area only four feet wide at most, squeezed in between the ship&rsquo;s stern and the adjacent cabin, appears to be a holding cell. A slim humanoid figure cowers in the far corner, chained to the hull.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure is that of a sea elf; the key to unlock his chains can be found in the captain&rsquo;s writing desk drawer (see <strong>area area 9</strong>). If the characters demonstrate friendship and release him, Oceanus (see appendix C) has an interesting story to relate and will assist the characters to the best of his ability in their undertaking. Oceanus speaks Aquan as well as Elvish.</p>
<p>If invited to do so, he joins the characters with enthusiasm and stays with them throughout the conclusion of this adventure. He will, if requested to do so, remain with the characters for further adventures (assuming that they continue with <em>Danger at Dunwater</em> and possibly also <em>The Final Enemy</em>), in which circumstances you could ask one of the players to play Oceanus. At all times he will be as cooperative as possible, playing a full role as an NPC in the party&rsquo;s undertakings (he will, of course, expect a normal portion of treasure). Afterward, he reluctantly leaves them to return home.</p>

<p><strong>How He Became Imprisoned:</strong> Oceanus is a member of the tribe of Manaan, which inhabits an undersea settlement about twenty miles southeast of Saltmarsh. He was stripped of his weapons and armor when imprisoned, but though bruised and hungry, he has suffered no great injury and his spirit is undaunted.</p>
<p>His tribe has noted, from a distance, the periodic travels of the <em>Sea Ghost</em> at night along a supposedly deserted coastal area. Suspicious of this behavior, the tribal chief ordered Oceanus to keep watch on this area, slip aboard when the ship arrived, and follow the ship back to its port of origin to discover what he could of these strange proceedings. This Oceanus did, and at the vessel&rsquo;s home port he witnessed the stowing aboard of a small arsenal of weaponry. He was then discovered, knocked out, and taken prisoner. He awakened some time later, chained to the ship&rsquo;s hull in this compartment.</p>
<p><strong>Since His Imprisonment:</strong> He is uncertain how long he has been a prisoner or what his ultimate fate would have been He has no knowledge of the lizardfolk aboard (he has not seen them), nor does he or any member of his tribe know for whom the arms are intended.</p>
<p>During his imprisonment he has been brought unpleasant food three times and a cup of brackish, stale water about six times. On each occasion the bearer has been a large bully of a person with a hook instead of a left hand (the bosun, though Oceanus does not know this). These visitations aside, he has been left to his own devices.</p>

<p>This cramped area, only four feet wide at the widest, is sandwiched between the adjacent cabin and the ship&rsquo;s stern.

<p>From the hatchway, you can see a little of what lies in the gloom below. This area stretches the full width of the ship and, for all you can see, the full length, for no bulkheads are in view. What must be the bottom of the ship is covered with a thick layer of wet sand (presumably ballast) on top of which is an inch or so of green, greasy water.</p>
<p>A scuttling noise toward the stern indicates there is some life down hereâ€”perhaps living off the garbage thrown in occasionally by the lazy crew, for there are heaps of trash immediately below the hatch that have formed small islands in the fetid water. A particularly large one has accumulated at the base of the mast.</p>
<p>As you move your light back and forth, you catch a yellow reflection in one of the garbage piles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A number of Rat eke out a precarious existence here, but they are of the normal variety and harmless. The bilge offers only 4 feet of headroom.</p>
<p>Two Swarm of Rot Grubs (see appendix C) live in the garbage island around the mast. A gold coin among the trash is the source of the reflection. The rot grubs attack anyone who comes near.</p>

The ramifications of that are discussed in the following section, &ldquo;Smuggled Goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, the characters have gained some or all the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to contraband, the smugglers are providing weapons to a colony of lizardfolk.</li>
<li>The lizardfolk colony is located within ten miles of Saltmarsh.</li>
<li>This weapon smuggling appears to have been going on for some months.</li>
</ul>
<p>If they have enough information, the characters should be able to deduce that the lizardfolk are planning an attack, either on Saltmarsh or on some other unknown location. Presented with this information, the town council is sure to have further need of the party.</p>
<p>Of course, the characters do not know the truth behind the lizardfolk&rsquo;s need to purchase weapons. To learn the truth, more of the story must unfold. See chapter 3, Danger at Dunwater.</p>
<h4 id=smuggled-goods>
<a href=#smuggled-goods class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Smuggled Goods</h4><p>The smugglers are very successful. Their main source of income is the sale of stolen goods, especially those marked with a royal seal or similar identifier that would make dealing with legitimate merchants impossible. They also take in goods from ships they have waylaid, usually spices, weapons, poisons, and other contraband that is either illegal or heavily taxed in this region. Currently, the ship&rsquo;s hold is crowded with mining equipment and kegs of brandy stolen from a royal shipment meant for a crown-sponsored mining operation in this region, along with silks that were originally destined for a royal trade mission.</p>
<p>If the characters break the smuggling ring, they are free to keep whatever other treasure they find without consequence, but the current contents of the hold must be handled carefully.</p>
<p>Representatives of the crown in Saltmarsh will pay 200 gp for the return of the silk and brandy stored under the house (in <strong>area area 27</strong>) and 500 gp for the merchandise aboard the <em>Sea Ghost</em> (the goods in <strong>area area 11</strong> and the weapons in <strong>area area 15</strong>).</p>
<p>Royal agents might also claim the smugglers' ship, but at your option, if the characters have proven eager to aid the crown, they are given the ship and pledged the service of a contingent of sailors to man it for one year.</p>
<p>If the characters keep the merchandise and try to sell it openly in the region, they find no buyers. Such an attempt earns them a poor reputation, the effect of which is up to you.</p>
