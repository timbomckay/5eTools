<p>Five years ago, a hermitage devoted to the contemplation of nature was established in an abandoned island fortress, once the site of a beacon meant to warn against invasion from the sea. The folk of the hermitage opened the island to people of all faiths, promising a place for those seeking solitude and peace. But that peace has now been shattered, and the characters must determine what force of evil has slain the residents of Firewatch Island almost to the lastâ€”and how to prevent the even greater tragedy to come.</p>
<p><em>Tammeraut&rsquo;s Fate</em> is an adventure designed for four to six 9th-level characters.</p>

Like much of Vaughn&rsquo;s work, this scenario builds a chilling scenario that requires the players to peel through several layers of mystery, decipher the truth of the matter, and face down supernatural horrors to end a threat before it can grow to its full power.</p>

Syrgaul and his crew showed no mercy to those who crossed their path, killing the crews of those ships that fell prey to him.</p>
<p>Syrgaul was a mighty sorcerer, and his crew was bloodthirsty and skilled in both sailing and killing. Worse still, Syrgaul claimed allegiance to Orcus, the demon lord of the undead.</p>
<p>Orcus did indeed seem to favor Syrgaul, who often benefited from strong winds in his sails and swirling currents that prevented his prey from escaping. In return, the pirate captain made sacrifices to the demon lord.</p>
<p>Syrgaul eventually met his end just over ten years ago. As he and his crew approached a naval post called Firewatch Island to plunder it, a priest garrisoned at the outpost implored the sea god, Procan, for mercy. Whether because of luck or because the cleric&rsquo;s prayers were answered, a sudden storm swept through the area, capsizing <em>Tammeraut</em> and sending the ship to the bottom of the sea.</p>

As his ship plunged into the sea, he called out to his fiendish patron. Orcus heeded his call and imbued Syrgaul and his crew with undeath, the twisted form of immortality he offers his followers.</p>
<p>The pirates, now fully under Orcus&rsquo;s thrall, emerged from the wreckage and marched across the seabed to Firewatch Island. They overran the garrison and carried the remains back to their wrecked ship. There, with Orcus&rsquo;s instruction, they began the laborious process of opening the Pit of Hatred, a rift to the Abyss that can transform corpses into drowned ones.</p>

The undead were careful to leave behind no sign of their presence, such that the next ship to drop anchor there found the place abandoned, its defenders seemingly vanished. The place was considered cursed for some time thereafter and remained abandoned until five years ago.</p>
<p>At that time, a minor order of monks, hermits, and contemplatives moved in and claimed the island as their home. The old garrison fort has been repaired and rebuilt as a place of peaceful living.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the island&rsquo;s latest residents, their peaceful reverie has been ruined. Syrgaul&rsquo;s crew has finally completed the work of preparing the Pit of Hatred. Now, they need humanoid corpses to feed into the pit and spawn more drowned ones like themselves. The hermits of Firewatch Island make the perfect first recruits.</p>

The village druid, Vortanim, asks the characters to investigate and make sure the hermitage is safe.</p>
<p>When they arrive at Firewatch Island, the characters discover a grisly scene. Evidence of a fatal battle and the presence of dangerous scavengers gives little hope of finding anyone alive. But when a handful of survivors are discovered hidden in a bolt-hole, the characters learn about the dark fate of the hermitage and its people. More important, they come to understand that after the drowned ones have finished hunting the last residents of Firewatch Island, the undead will turn their attention to the settlements of the coastâ€”becoming an unstoppable army of undead.</p>
<p>As darkness falls, the drowned ones that attacked the hermitage the previous night return to finish the job. The characters must defend themselves and the survivors, using the assault as an opportunity to destroy the drowned ones before their threat can spread. After doing so, the characters learn of the island&rsquo;s history and how it connects to the undead attacks. They then have a chance to destroy the underwater source of evilâ€”the twisted undead captain Syrgaul. Seeking the undead in his watery lair, they discover the damaged magical seal that once kept the portal inside the Pit of Hatred closed. Only by resealing the rift can they end its corruption for good.</p>

<p><strong>Eberron:</strong> Built by Aundair during the Last War, the fort on Firewatch Island once guarded the mouth of Scions Sound against threats from Karrnath, but it has since become a place of meditation and retreat. Ten years before the end of the war, the fort was attacked by the Order of the Emerald Claw. In desperation, the defenders called upon the Traveler for divine aid that seemingly saved the fort. But in the end, the god&rsquo;s fickle whim saw Syrgaul and his crew transformed, and ultimately doomed the garrison.</p>
<p><strong>Forgotten Realms:</strong> On FaerÃ»n, Firewatch Island rises out of the Wyvernwater in Cormyr. It was once the site of a Purple Dragon outpost north of Wheloon, intended to keep watch over that prison city. When a Sembian raiding force was sent to take the outpost and gain access to Wheloon, the garrison&rsquo;s Northlander cleric called on Valkur for aid. The Sembian boats were sent to the bottom of the lake, where Netherese magic carried by the raiders wrought a terrible transformation on the drowned crew.</p>
<p><strong>Mystara:</strong> Concerned by growing evidence of a Thyatian attack, Duke Stefan of Karameikos saw a need to establish an outpost on an island near Rugalov. As tensions faded and concern waned, Duke von Hendricks of the Black Eagle Barony saw an opportunity, and dispatched agents of the Iron Ring to seize Firewatch Island as a naval base. In the Known World, Nyx or Orcus could be Syrgaul&rsquo;s patron, and Janore Stormswake could be a follower of Protius.</p>

You might have them drawn into the mystery by chance, trusting the players to want to explore the devastated hermitage, rescue the survivors, and learn what happened. Alternatively, consider either of the following hooks to get the characters to the hermitage.</p>

Doing so takes the characters through the village of Uskarn where they learn that something is wrong on Firewatch Island. The mission they are on is not time-sensitive, leaving the characters a free day or two to investigate. The contents of the message and the NPC who gave them the mission can be designed to fit your campaign.</p>

Raal offers a bounty if the characters can track down Morley Tobe, a dwarf who absconded after failing to repay a 8,000 gp debt owed to Raal. The merchant found out that Morley fled to Firewatch Island (where he&rsquo;s hiding in <strong>area area 25</strong>) and is posing as a pious hermit to dodge his debts. Raal hires the characters to reclaim the money he is owed or, failing that, to bring Morley to him (after which the dwarf will be sold to pirates to recoup Raal&rsquo;s losses). If they take the job, Raal tells them how to get to Uskarn, which is the closest mainland community to the island.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The road is little more than a gravel track hugging the coastline. The day is hot, and the air is thick with the scent and sound of the sea. Suddenly, you hear harsh cries and the sounds of a scuffle from up ahead. Rounding a curve, you see a woman kneeling next to a body, sobbing as she hunches protectively over the remains. Circling in the air a few feet above her, eight harpies screech and flail at each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sobbing woman is actually a harpy matriarch (see appendix C), which has used its magic to disguise itself as a middle-aged human female. The eight Harpy that serve the matriarch circle above. Any character who makes a successful DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check sees through her ruse and realizes she is not human.</p>
<p>If the characters approach to assist the woman or attack the harpies, they witness the harpy matriarch&rsquo;s transformation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The woman stands suddenly, turning to reveal a gore-caked mouth and hollow black eyes. In an instant, she is surrounded by a cloud of flapping skeletal birds and her own shape shifts to that of a gray-feathered harpy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The harpies and their matriarch attack the characters in the hope of claiming another easy meal.</p>
<h3 id=unfortunate-swimmer>
<a href=#unfortunate-swimmer class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Unfortunate Swimmer</h3><p>The corpse on the beach was once an older human male, with a scraggly gray beard and short gray hair balding at the crown. His left ear is missing, though it is obviously an old wound. He wears only a pair of homespun, water-soaked breeches, and his skin is wrinkled from having spent time in the water. A character who succeeds on a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch>) check determines that the man died of exhaustion.</p>
<p>This was Philpert, a member of the Firewatch Island hermitage who escaped the drowned ones' attack by swimming three miles of open sea. Sadly, his exhausted body gave out just a short distance from land, and his corpse washed up on the beach with the next tide.</p>
<p>If <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> is used to communicate with the body, it initially produces incoherent rambling about terror in the dark and the sea being the only escape. A careful questioner might be able to extract further information depending on the questions asked.</p>
<p>In his former life, Philpert spent much of his time slumming in the village of Uskarn, living off the charity of its citizens. Joining the Firewatch Island hermitage allowed him to finally find peace. But the horror of the drowned ones' attack shattered his sanity, so that at best he can recount only that the attackers came from the sea, were humanoid in appearance, and had glowing eyes and rotting flesh.</p>

Though the place is primarily a human settlement, a handful of elves, dwarves, and gnomes have also made their homes here.</p>
<p>Most of Uskarn&rsquo;s inhabitants earn a living fishing in the shallows of the adjacent bay or venturing farther out to sea if they&rsquo;re after more impressive catches. The village boasts an unusually large port for its size, used both for its own fishing boats and for the trading vessels and naval ships that frequently stop here on their way through the area.</p>

<p>Characters who do spend time in the village might be drawn to the popular tavern known as the Fog and Frog, a large warehouse converted into a drinking establishment with a dozen modest rooms to rent in the back. The tavern is run by council member Skeldruff Plenk, who brews a much-lauded lager called Plenk&rsquo;s Plenk.</p>
<p>If the characters ask about Philpert in Uskarn, the villagers know him by description. Anyone can tell the characters about Philpert&rsquo;s history in the village, and most residents know he had been living at the Firewatch Island hermitage for the past several months. The people of Uskarn are understandably concerned if one of the peaceful hermits of the island has turned up dead. Though they have no money to offer as incentive, the villagers are quick to ask the characters to check on the hermitage to make sure everything is all right.</p>
<p>If the characters spend any time in Uskarn other than the minimum required to use it as a jumping-off point for the adventure, the following details about prominent people and other background information might come in handy.</p>

The council consists of the following members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vortanim (NG male human druid), an elderly and good-natured sage and bookseller</li>
<li>Bellis Bellweather (CG female halfling commoner), a bright-spirited cheese shop owner</li>
<li>Mirria Delvane (N female human guard), a retired soldier turned blacksmith</li>
<li>Valissia Arrowen (CN female elf spy), an elf guide and scout who runs a fur and leather shop</li>
<li>Skeldruff Plenk (LN male gnome commoner), a beer maker and proprietor of the Fog and Frog tavern</li>
<li>Marius Golpin (NE male human thug), the unscrupulous owner of a general store</li>

His taciturn agent Merrick (N male halfling veteran) commands a small force of deputies and officers who maintain order in the village, and who look poorly on foreign troublemakers. Visitors are likely to receive a visit from Merrick or one of his officers soon after arriving, the official offering a cool welcome along with questions about their business in town and intended length of stay.</p>

Several of Merrick&rsquo;s deputies are in the pocket of Griff Talsin (CE male human bandit captain), ostensibly a maritime merchant who trades in fine cloth and dry goods. Talsin is actually a black-hearted privateer who gets most of his wares from illegal raids against coastal villages across the bay. Any trouble with Talsin attracts the attention of his more powerful pirate allies, which could lead to or connect with further adventures.</p>

Its only feature of note is the hermitage built on the site of the abandoned ruin of its old fortress.</p>
<p>The tiny island, 800 feet long by 400 feet wide, is a mixture of scrubby woodland and rocky hills. Three stony peaks rise above the grass and shrubs. The tallest stands more than 400 feet high along the southern coast of the island, while the other two are 300 and 100 feet high respectively.</p>
<p>Aside from the hermits, the island is normally home to only vermin, rats, a variety of noisy birds, and various tide pool creatures. But now the stink of corpses in area 14 has drawn additional scavengers from the surrounding waters and the mainlandâ€”including a dangerous monster.</p>
<h3 id=look-out-above>

This creature has long hunted across the region, searching for fishing boats or passenger ships to attack. The locals watch for and fear Rasp, and they know that it has several lairs along the coast. None who have tried to hunt the creature have returned.</p>
<p>The peryton makes frequent passes over the island nowadays, hoping to spot survivors of the recent attack that it can devour. If the characters arrive by day, Rasp welcomes them with its claws and beak. It is smart enough to not fight to the death, though, and it leaves the island to return to one of its mainland lairs if reduced to half its hit points or fewer.</p>
<p>If Rasp reduces a character to 0 hit points, it attempts to pick the character up and fly back to its newly claimed lair in <strong>area area 24</strong>.</p>
<p>Rasp&rsquo;s recent predations have prompted other creatures on the island to stay out of sight. The native fauna do not wander freely, nor do the remaining residents.</p>

A one-way trip costs 5 sp. The ferry is mastered by Ulder Raserhill (LN male half-orc commoner), a short-tempered individual who begrudges his fate as a backwater sailor. If the characters request him to wait for them (or if he thinks the characters are rich), he asks for an extra payment of as much as 50 gp.</p>
<p>To give the characters a way to explore on their own or to leave the island independently, the Uskarn council arranges for their use of a large rowboat, which Underhill tows to the island when he transports his passengers.</p>
<p>If the characters have their own ship it&rsquo;s easy for them to reach Firewatch Island. Keep in mind that having access to their own ship makes escaping the island easy, but if the characters flee, then they might have no way of tracking the undead back to the Pit of Hatred.</p>
<p>Characters who make their own way to the island can start the adventure by landing at any point along its shore. If they use the ferry, Raserhill puts in only at the pier near the hermitage on the north shore of the island. He drops off his passengers and the rowboat, then promptly heads back to the mainland.</p>

As the characters approach, they can hear the faint sound of a large bell being rung, seemingly coming from the island. But the sound fades quickly and is not heard again. (One of the survivors at the hermitage rang the bell when he saw the characters' vessel approaching, but he was waylaid thereafter; see <strong>area area 24</strong> for more information.)</p>
<p>When the characters come within sight of the island, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sun makes the waves sparkle as Firewatch Island comes fully into view. Three barren hills are its most noticeable landmarks, rising above narrow, rocky beaches and small wiry shrubs on an otherwise sparse landscape. In between those high points, a small fortress and beacon tower can be seen. The building is made of stone and looks to have two floors. A bell tower rises an additional two stories above the rest of the building, and a low stone wall surrounds part of the complex.</p>

The interior ceilings are 10 feet high, and the floors are paved with flagstones. The roof is covered in slate tiles except in places where those tiles have fallen or broken, and those areas have been subsequently repaired and replaced with thatch.</p>
<p>The wooden doors in the hermitage are usually unlocked. A locked door can be bashed open with a successful DC 12 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check, or smashed through (AC 15, 18 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).</p>

Some of these doors have been secured against another assault by the drowned ones, and must be forced open. See each area&rsquo;s description for details.</p>
<p>There are no windows on the first floor of the fortress, but a hole in the north wall of the midden (<strong>area area 5</strong>) allows access for a Small or smaller creature.</p>
<p>Characters can enter the hermitage on the second level through the door of the guard tower (<strong>area area 21</strong>), or by climbing the walls and forcing open one of the second-story windows.

Pier and Beach</h4><blockquote>
<p>A short wooden pier extends out into the water, connected by a path to an open archway in the fortress wall. The pier is in good shape, with wooden pilings raising it well above the high tide line of the rocky beach. The area is deserted, with no other boats or people in sight. The call of gulls, the shrieking of crows, and the crashing of the waves are the only sounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters took the ferry to the island, Raserhill quickly offloads a shipment of dried beans and apples, several barrels of water, and a few crates of other supplies before he casts off and returns to Uskarn. If he has any concerns about not being met by folk from the hermitage, he makes no sign that he cares. Unless the characters have made other arrangements, the ferry returns shortly after sunrise the next day.</p>
<p>A character who makes a successful DC 16 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices humanoid tracks leading from the waterline to the hermitage. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check also notes distinct tracks returning to the waterline (the trail left by the drowned ones as they departed the island).</p>
<p>Within a few minutes of arriving on the island, the characters are attacked by the monstrous peryton, Rasp. See the &ldquo;<strong>area Look Out Above</strong>&rdquo; section for more information.</p>
<p>If Raserhill has been paid to stay close by the island with his ferry, his reaction to Raspâ€”and the monster&rsquo;s reaction to himâ€”is up to you.</p>

Courtyard Gardens</h4><blockquote>
<p>An archway in the fortress&rsquo;s outer wall provides access to a large courtyard, now filled with vegetable gardens and a small orchard of stunted apple trees. Stairs to the east and west lead up to walkways overlooking the yard. To the southwest, the base of the bell tower is obscured by thick growths of vines, which also shroud the west stairs. A set of double doors stands along the front of the hermitage on the far side of the garden, and appears to be the only way inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters have not already visited area 3, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Along the eastern side of the courtyard, the wall of the fortress once abutted the larger of the island&rsquo;s rocky hills. But that hillside has since been hewn away to create a passage rounding the corner of the hermitage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vines at the base of the bell tower (<strong>area area 15</strong>) are four Assassin Vine (see appendix C). Brought to the island by a druid named Tallos (one of those killed by the drowned ones), the vines are rooted in large clay pots. Tallos grew the vines for their fruit, which he fermented into a unique wine. The other residents knew to give a wide berth to the vines, which attack anyone (except the now-dead druid) that comes within their reach.

Yard and Cistern</h4><blockquote>
<p>A low, unfinished stone wall encloses a broad, sandy yard abutting an open vista of beach and sea. A small tower accessible by an external stair rises against the hermitage&rsquo;s eastern wall. Several scrubby bushes stand to the north of a large oval pool at the center of the yard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters have not already visited area 2, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Along the north edge of the yard, the wall of the fortress once abutted the larger of the island&rsquo;s rocky hills. But that hillside has since been hewn away to create a passage rounding the corner of the hermitage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the fortress was abandoned, the garrison soldiers were in the process of enclosing this yard behind a 3-foot-wide, 15-foot-high wall identical to the one protecting the courtyard (<strong>area area 2</strong>). The unfinished wall stands 3 feet high.</p>
<p>Two Sea Hag were drawn to the island during the recent attack, when they heard the screams of the victims of the drowned ones. While prowling around the hermitage with an invisible stalker they summoned, the hags spotted the characters approaching and have hidden in the scrub nearest the wall.</p>
<p>The hags can be noticed only by a creature who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. The <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> stalker is in the cistern and cannot normally be seen. If anyone spots any of the three monsters or moves within 5 feet of the cistern&rsquo;s edge, these creatures attack.</p>
<p>The hags try to flee into the sea if the stalker is slain.</p>

The hags have lived in the area for years, and they witnessed the first drowned one attack ten years before. They refer to the drowned ones as &ldquo;walkers,&rdquo; because the creatures plod along the floor of the bay, never swimming. They did not see the shipwreck during the storm, and know only the that the walkers came from the general direction of the Pit of Hatred. They eagerly give the characters directions to the rift, trading predictions of party members' deaths all the while.</p>

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check while looking in the cistern spots something beneath the muck.</p>
<p>Anyone who swims to the bottom can recover a leather sack containing 125 gp, a gold paperweight in the shape of a tortoise (100 gp), a silver candelabra stamped with the symbol of the sea god Procan (50 gp), and two <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Greater Healing</wc-fetch>.</p>

Adjust the read-aloud text accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pieces of broken planking and debris reinforce the damaged north doors of this room, whose floor and walls are spattered by bloodstains. A twisted padlock lies at the foot of the north doors, and the south doors have been nearly ripped from their hinges. Arrow slits are visible in the east wall, shrouded by cobwebs. The west wall displays patches where similar arrow slits have been bricked over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the drowned ones assaulted the hermitage, they broke down the main doors here and caught its residents by surprise. The arrow slits are 3 feet above the floor and 6 inches wide; the area beyond cannot be seen because of the spiderwebs. The hermits' patchwork is of poor quality, and the bricked-up arrow slits can be smashed through with a successful DC 18 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>A character who makes a successful DC 16 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices numerous humanoid tracks in the blood and dirt streaking the floor. With a successful DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check, a character discerns more than a dozen individual sets of tracks, some of which are outlined by a thick crust of salt.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The inhabitants of the hermitage use this room as a dump and privy, dropping their refuse through the trapdoor above. They bricked over the arrow slits and the door to contain the smell. A hole in the north wall allows creatures of Small size or smaller to come and go freely.</p>

<p>Stairs rise to a railed balcony that covers two walls of this large, vaulted chamber. The balcony stands ten feet above the floor, with heavy crossbeams above reinforcing the twenty-foot-high, slate-tiled ceiling. Here and there, missing ceiling tiles have been covered over with thatch.</p>
<p>A large, rusty metal tub and a broken wooden frame stand near the staircase. The floor shows spatters of blood and obvious signs of a recent scuffle.</p>

<p>This area was once a gallery, but the hermitage residents have turned it into a scullery. The tub formerly served as the oil receptacle for the beacon in the tower above (see area 24), but it now holds dirty water and shattered crockery. The wooden frame is a drying rack for laundry. Behind the tub sits a bucket of lye with a copper scoop, and several pumice stones for scrubbing.</p>
<p>The drowned ones killed several hermits here, then hauled the bodies to <strong>area area 14</strong>. The door from this area to area 11 has since been barricaded from this side.</p>

<p>The balcony&rsquo;s construction is shabby, and the wooden poles that precariously support it look unsafe. It can support up to 200 pounds of weight before collapsing. Anyone on the balcony when it collapses falls 20 feet to the floor below, taking normal falling damage.</p>

<p>Faded tapestries showing maritime scenes and dramatic storms at sea hang from the north and south walls of this cozy room. The floor is carpeted in a ragged green shag woven to depict a crashing wave. A low set of book-laden shelves sits against the east wall, and three wooden tables and several chairs fill the rest of the room. Books are strewn about the tables and the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chamber once served as a chapel devoted to the god of the sea for the members of the fortress garrison. It was here that Oloran, the chaplain of the fortress, prayed to Procan for divine intervention against the approaching <em>Tammeraut</em>. The residents of the hermitage, who generally espouse no particular religion, have converted the chamber into a library. Any character who has an appropriate background or who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check recognizes that the carpet depicts the symbol of Procan, the sea god.</p>

By and large, these tomes deal with common philosophical quandaries and the passive contemplation of nature. The books are old and impressive-looking but have no monetary value.</p>
<p>If the characters search the library, one of them discovers a handwritten poem scrawled into the open cover of a book. The fragment was composed by Oloran, the chaplain of the garrison, the morning after <em>Tammeraut</em> sank. It was intended as a paean to Procan, also known as the Storm Lord, and a warning to the god&rsquo;s foes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Beware the sea and its scarlet harbinger</em>.</p>
<p><em>Beware the sword and death that await</em>.</p>
<p><em>For guidance, we beseech almighty Storm Lord</em>;</p>
<p><em>Consign to our foes</em> Tammeraut&rsquo;s <em>fate</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beginning of the verse will look familiar to characters who visit the belfry (<strong>area area 24</strong>). See that area for more information.</p>
<p>A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check recognizes &ldquo;Tammeraut&rdquo; as a family name, and recalls that it was a noble clan that faded from history years ago.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This space beneath the watchtower of <strong>area area 21</strong> was once a holding cell for prisoners. Tallos the druid converted the space into a distillery.

<p>What was apparently once the main barracks of the stronghold has been turned into individual meditation cells by the residents of the hermitage. Numerous wooden poles have been crudely lashed together and hung with curtains to create eight-foot-high partitions throughout the room. The ceiling peaks twenty feet overhead, where a thatched roof is reinforced with wooden poles.</p>
<p>The entire room is a shambles, with many of the partitions damaged and the curtains torn apart. Debris and the broken remains of simple furnishings are strewn about, while pools of drying blood and gore fill the room with a metallic stink.</p>

<p>The drowned ones' main assault on the hermitage took place here. Most of the residents were sleeping in their cells and died in the first minutes of the attack. The hermitage&rsquo;s only real hope of fighting off the invaders, the druid Tallos, died in his cot. All the bodies were dragged away by the drowned ones, after which the sea hags found in <strong>area area 3</strong> did some looting here.</p>
<p>Rats attracted by the slaughter are skulking in this room. Because the drowned ones removed the corpses, the rat swarms have found little to eat. They stream from beneath broken furniture and from behind partitions and curtains to attack anyone entering the room.</p>
<p>Every round, three Swarm of Rats appear in one of the cells (your choice) and pour out to devour the characters. A total of twelve swarms can appear in this way.</p>

<p>A large mass of corpses is barely visible below the water&rsquo;s surface near the boat. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check or approach within 5 feet of the water to spot the bodies, which are bound together in a fishing net.</p>
<p>The bodies are being stored here by the drowned ones until they can all be transported to the Pit of Hatred, where they will be turned into more undead to swell the ranks of Syrgaul&rsquo;s minions. It is Syrgaul&rsquo;s ultimate plan to create an army of drowned ones that can lay waste to populated coastal areasâ€”which, of course, leads to even more creatures coming under his sway (see &ldquo;<strong>area Conclusion</strong>&rdquo; for more information).</p>
<p>Three Chuul hide beneath the mass of corpses. These creatures were attracted by blood in the water, and have been feeding idly on the bodies below the surface. They are quick to notice anyone on the shore or entering the water, lunging out to attack.</p>

It holds up to eight Medium humanoids and is propelled by oars and a small sail. When the drowned ones arrived, they damaged the boat by smashing its hull with rocks to prevent the hermits from escaping. Anyone approaching can see that the boat is half submerged and that its hull has several holes.</p>

After they return by night to search for other survivors, the undead intend to drag their load of corpses back to the Pit of Hatred as a sacrifice to its foul essence.</p>
<p>The thirteen corpses are mostly humans and half-elves, along with one dwarf. All show signs of vicious stabbing and slashing wounds, broken bones, and blunt trauma. The bodies have been dead for about a day and submerged since dawn.</p>
<p>These corpses can be interrogated with a <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> spell. None of the dead hermits understands why the hermitage was attacked, but they can provide luridly detailed information about the nature of their undead attackers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This damp, dark tower room smells of rot and mildew. The floor glistens with puddles of water, and trickles of moisture dribble down the wall to the west and south. What once might have been barrels and crates stacked against the walls have decayed into nearly unidentifiable heaps of mold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room served as a storeroom for mundane materials for the original garrison but has not seen any use since then. The contents of the barrels and crates mostly consist of ruined linens and brackish water. The containers themselves are rotted and untrustworthy as well.</p>

Rather than risk exposing themselves to it, they chose to lock the door and throw away the key. A 10-foot-by-10-foot patch of green slime lurks on the ceiling in the western portion of the room. Any character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices the slime before stepping under it. Otherwise, the slime falls on any creature passing below it. See &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide for information on green slime.</p>

<p>Bundles, barrels, and boxes are piled haphazardly across this tower room. A narrow path leads through the clutter to a staircase curving along the chamber&rsquo;s inner wall. The stairs rise to an open trapdoor in the celling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formerly an armory, this room has stored ever-accumulating masses of junk since the hermitage&rsquo;s founding. All kinds of mundane equipment is stored here, most of it having no value. This includes such things as a 1-foot length of hempen rope, a harp with only one string, a single left boot, a bucket with no bottom, and so forth.</p>
<p>Still, a number of items are of potential help in fortifying the hermitage against another attack. These include a 10-pound cask of iron nails, a bent crowbar, three clay planters for the garden, a hammer, a rusty hand saw, a hooded lantern, a few 10-foot lengths of hempen rope, and a stack of firewood.</p>

<p>A walkway open to the sky overlooks a grotto formed by the island&rsquo;s rocky peak and the hermitage&rsquo;s walls, leading from the hermitage to the large tower along its west side. A crenellated battlement blocks the walkway in and is set with arrow slits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This battlement served as the main point of defense for the fortress&rsquo;s postern entrance from the grotto, allowing the garrison to fire arrows or hurl rocks at invaders. It remains an excellent defensive position.</p>
<p>The door from the open battlement into the corridor that leads to area 18 and the interior of the second level is barricaded from the inside. Breaking through it from outside requires a successful DC 14 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

<p>A partial wall divides this chamber into two sections. Two arrow slits are set into the west wall, and a small fireplace stands to the north. Several tables crowd the room, all covered with sheaves of paper, quills, ink pots, candles, and a few bound books. Numerous uncomfortable-looking stools stand around them. One of the ink pots has been overturned, resulting in a large black stain on one tabletop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chamber served as the officers' quarters for the original garrison. After the hermits moved in, they converted it to a scriptorium where they compose philosophical tracts, illuminate other texts, or copy manuscripts. Completed works are moved downstairs to the library.</p>
<p>Three Giant Coral Snake (see appendix C) lurk in this chamber. The snakes originally lived in a cave on the east side of the isle, where they fed on rats. When the rats were drawn to the fortress by the smell of death, the snakes followed, entering this area through the arrow slits. The snakes are currently coiled up in the north section of the room, and emerge to attack anyone who trespasses in their new lair.</p>

<p>Arrow slits set along the walls of this chamber make it a bit drafty. Murder holes open up in the center of the floor, overlooking the entryway into the level below. A fireplace is set into the south wall, with a dusty iron kettle close by. A trapdoor is set into the floor at either end of this chamber.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This area was a key defensive point for protecting the main entrance (<strong>area area 4</strong>) against incursion. The kettle was once used to boil oil for the murder holes. This chamber is rarely visited by the residents of the hermitage, except to use the trapdoor into <strong>area area 5</strong> as a dump and a privy.</p>

<p>The door to this chamber hangs open, with the detached head of a mace on the floor acting as a doorstop. The room is modestly furnished with a cot, a table, a chest, and a chair. An oddly shaped basin rests on the table, with a small piece of mirror hanging from the wall above it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the fortress was occupied, this area was the quarters of the chaplain Oloran. The leader of the hermitage moved in here after his sect took over the island five years before. Old Prior Borisanth had little interaction with the other residents, due to his having taken a vow of silence. On the night of the attack, he was awakened by the noise and slain by a drowned one as he opened his door. The broken handle of his mace rolled under his cot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where this small guard tower once abutted the east side of the fortress, part of the fortress wall has been knocked out to create an open doorway into the interior, with a rickety-looking balcony beyond.

Under an arrow slit looking toward the island&rsquo;s western peak, a dusty desk is covered in debris and fresh bird droppings. Hinges hang on either side of each arrow slit, indicating that at one time they had shutters to keep out the elements.</p>
<p>A section of the wall to the southwest has collapsed inward, opening up to the rocky slope of the island&rsquo;s smaller hill ten feet below. The pile of rubble covers the smashed remains of a chair.</p>

<p>Archais, the wizard of the old Firewatch Island garrison, once resided in this chamber. It was he who first gave the warning of the approaching <em>Tammeraut</em>, resulting in Oloran&rsquo;s desperate prayer to Procan and the ship&rsquo;s resulting demise. The wizard&rsquo;s gull familiar spied the ship at sea and brought word back to him. Archais was slain with the rest of the garrison during the drowned ones' initial attack.</p>
<p>The weathering of storms and the salty air has eroded the mortar in part of the wall, causing the collapse. The room is still secure, but the hermits deemed this area uninhabitable due to the damage.</p>
<p>The pile of rubble in the southwest corner conceals a secret compartment in part of the surviving wall, just south of the west arrow slit. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check while searching the room discovers the compartment. If the characters clear the rubble, they automatically find the compartment.</p>

<p>The compartment also contains a leather backpack where Archais kept his spellbook and his journal. His spellbook is long lost, but the journal remains inside.</p>
<p>Archais&rsquo;s journal relates his numerous assignments and duty stations while a member of the military. It also includes notes about the different sunken ships he has explored in the surrounding bay and its tributary rivers. The final entry on this list gives the location of the sunken <em>Tammeraut</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the journal is moldy and illegible. The last few pages are intact, and they relate the events surrounding the coming of <em>Tammeraut</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our worst fears are confirmed. Virgil has brought word of disaster. A war galley fully loaded with pirates approaches from the southwest. It flies the flag of the raiders and bears the name of the cursed ship</em> Tammeraut. <em>We must prepare what feeble defense we can muster. Woe to the folk of the coast at the approach of this bloody tide</em>.</p>
<p>â€¢</p>
<p><em>Miracle of miracles! The storm lord has answered the prayers of our illustrious chaplain. A furious storm blew in from the open sea and swept the war galley to its doom. But I believe that the vessel went down near the Pit of Hatred, an ill-starred undersea chasm two miles south of Firewatch Isle. This does not bode well, for the rift is said to be a passage to a source of interminable evil that was long ago sealed away. If the wreckage should rupture the wards, terrible darkness might be unleashed. I must mount an expedition to the sunken hulk and make sure all is well</em>.</p>
<p>â€¢</p>
<p><em>A fell wind blows this evening. I fear the wards on the rift have been broken. I must set out first thing in the morning to inspect the wreckage</em>.</p>

<p>A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check connects the journal&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;raiders&rdquo; to the pirate captain Syrgaul, a notorious sorcerer who forged an unholy pact with the demon lord Orcus. He and his crew never left survivors of their attacks, and his ship, <em>Tammeraut</em>, was the scourge of the seas.</p>

<p>This open belfry offers a breathtaking view of the open sea and the distant coast. Four stone corner posts support the belfry&rsquo;s conical slate roof where it peaks twenty feet above, with a crenellated battlement running between them.</p>
<p>A human body is sprawled in a depression at the center of the stone floor, its torso torn open and its heart missing. The base of what was once a metal framework surrounds the depression. Above the body, a large bronze bell engraved with symbols of peace and serenity hangs from a crossbeam, with a pull rope dangling from the rigging above. Across the floor next to the body, a message is scrawled in chalk: &ldquo;BEWARE THE SEA KILLERS.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The belfry was originally Firewatch Island&rsquo;s signal beacon. The depression in the floor once held the large oil receptacle that fueled the beacon (this now sits in <strong>area area 7</strong>). The metal framework extended above this receptacle and held the lenses that focused the light of the beacon&rsquo;s flame. The hermitage disassembled the beacon and installed the bell for sounding at mealtime and to signal the start of meditation sessions.</p>

<p>Rasp, the monstrous peryton (see appendix C), has established a temporary lair in the belfry while it scours the island to feed.

<p>A rickety ladder leads down from the larder into a musty subterranean chamber enclosed by rough masonry walls. Three trembling figures are huddled against the far wall, sharing the chamber with the dusty, deteriorated remains of an armored corpse. The body&rsquo;s sightless eye sockets stare up blankly, and a small silver disk is clutched in one of its skeletal hands. A horizontal crevice between two blocks in the south wall glows with faint daylight, marking a narrow opening that leads outside the fortress.</p>

<p>The builders of the fortress created this hidden cellar as a refuge. Only the officers, the chaplain, and the resident wizard knew of its existence.

<p>Both Barret and Morley have contracted the disease called bluerot from the drowned ones (see appendix C). Barret is very ill and has lost 4 points of Constitution and Charisma from the disease. Unless he is cured, one hour after the characters discover him, Barret must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (<wc-roll>4d8</wc-roll>) necrotic damage. A failed save likely kills him.</p>
<p>Morley fared better and has lost only 1 point of Constitution and Charisma. He must make his first DC 12 Constitution saving throw against the disease in roughly 20 hours. This means that he is alive for the drowned ones' second assault.</p>

She heard whispers in her mind that led her to this place, and her intuition told her that the skeleton found here was the remains of a fellow priest of Procan. (The skeleton is indeed the remains of the priest whose plea for help led to the sinking of <em>Tammeraut</em>.)</p>
<p>Acting quickly, she found Aaron in the kitchen and grabbed him just as he heard the dormitory door splintering. Morley and Barrett staggered into the larder soon after, wounded and in need of help. Janore says she dragged them inside and was about to seal the entrance when the larder door banged open:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a corpse, dripping wet, shriveled and discolored as if by long immersion in the sea. It stalked into the room and began to search, so I sealed the door. Miraculously, it missed our hiding place, though it kept scrabbling at the floor as if it could sense us below. But then as the first glow of dawn showed at the cleft in the wall there, it suddenly fled.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By peering through the crevice to the south, the survivors witnessed the undead gathering the slain residents into nets. The monsters walked back into the sea, dragging several of the nets behind them. More than a dozen corpses remain to be salvaged from the grotto, waiting for the undead to return.</p>
<p>At dawn, Aaron went up and out to search for survivors. Finding none, he remained outside to keep watch for passing ships. He planned on ringing the bell to draw their attention. In the meantime, he tried to fortify the place as well as he could.</p>
<p>Having witnessed the undead at their work, the survivors are convinced they will be backâ€”perhaps as early as tonight, after the sun sets.</p>

If the characters haven&rsquo;t already done so, she guesses that the undead are still following the orders they were under when <em>Tammeraut</em> was sunk. They intend to seize the hermitage and destroy its last defenders, then use the island as a staging ground for attacks against the settlements of the coast.</p>

Aaron was supposed to check on the status of the boat kept in <strong>area area 14</strong>, and since he failed to return Janore has been afraid to investigate further. Until the characters appeared, the survivors believed that they had been abandoned, and that the only way off the island is the ferry. But even if the characters have the means of leaving the island immediately, or they can repair the hermitage&rsquo;s boat with <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch>, the knowledge that the drowned ones mean to use Firewatch Island as a base from which to launch further mayhem across the region should give them pause.</p>
<p>An undead assault against the coast could come at any number of locations and be all but impossible to defend against. Because the drowned ones are able to add to their undead ranks, each successful attack would increase the size of their army. But knowing that the undead likely plan to return to Firewatch Island to destroy its last survivors gives the characters a single chance for a controlled fight. Destroying the drowned ones before they capture the hermitage might be the only way to end their threat.</p>
<p>If the characters decide to stay and await the fall of night, Janore and the others insist on remaining in the bolt-holeâ€”it&rsquo;s been safe so far and they&rsquo;re not eager to risk compromising their sanctuary. None of the survivors know exactly how many drowned ones there are, but they believe that securing all the entrances to the hermitage would be beneficial. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check calms the survivors enough that they agree to leave the bolt-hole, and they can help the characters barricade the hermitage, set up traps, and otherwise prepare to face the undead.</p>

<p>Enough wood and nails can be found inside the hermitage to reinforce all the doors. The main obstacle is time. It takes a character 1 hour to gather the required materials and reinforce one door. The time is cut in half if another character (including one of the survivors) helps.</p>
<p>A reinforced door cannot be broken through with a Strength check, but must be battered down (AC 15, 30 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage). This fact helps slow the undead, since they are forced to fight their way through doors.</p>

They arrive at the island about an hour after sundown. If the characters are still on the island at sundown and are observing the shoreline, you can foreshadow the undead assault:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the last rays of the evening sun slant across the dark waters of the bay, you catch movement from the corner of your eye along the beachâ€”a dark humanoid form standing silently in the surf. You are positive it wasn&rsquo;t there a moment ago. With the next crashing breaker, you lose sight of the intruder in the deepening darkness. When the spray clears, the figure is gone. Night has fallen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The undead assault against the hermitage can be played out in two broad scenarios. Both offer roughly the same challenge but provide different experiences for the players and characters. Choose the experience you think your players will enjoy the most, or create your own, incorporating any of the following elements and information you desire.</p>
<p>The Drowned Ascetic, Drowned Assassin, and Drowned Blade that make up the ranks of the undead are all described in appendix C.</p>

Thanks to the hags, rats, giant snakes, and the monstrous peryton, their resources might be depleted.

Adjust the difficulty of the attack as you see fit, depending on the party&rsquo;s available resources and the measure of your mercy.</p>

<p>The drowned ones arrive as a single mass, trying to overwhelm the defenders with sheer numbers. The intention with this scenario is to make the players and the characters feel as though the island teems with undead. An epic battle ensues, and if that battle is won, no further attacks come.</p>
<p>When the undead arrive, they attempt to batter down the doors of the hermitage, intent on entering and slaying any mortal defenders. Have the drowned ones assault the doors leading into the different areas of the fortress using the following guidelines.</p>

<p>Each new wave arrives approximately 30 minutes after the previous wave. In any area where the undead break through a door, the characters must reinforce that door again when the current fight is over, or subsequent waves will move through it freely.

Raserhill&rsquo;s ferry returns about an hour after sunrise, on its normal schedule, but the craft carries no new passengers and departs again quickly unless the characters hail it. (If Raserhill stuck around the island and was driven off or killed by the monstrous peryton, another boat from Uskarn will set out eventually to investigate the characters' fate.)</p>
<p>At some time during the day, when a character is awake and outside or near a window, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sultry day is silent except for the sounds of the sea. A lone bird circles in lazy loops in the sky overhead. Eventually it descends and alights on a nearby rock. It&rsquo;s a gull, and an old one at that, with a chipped beak and patches missing from its thinning feathers. It waddles closer, gazing intelligently at you with weak, rheumy eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ancient gull is Virgil, formerly the familiar of Archais, Firewatch Island&rsquo;s wizard. Virgil survived the slaughter of the garrison ten years before and has lived on the island ever since, nesting in the wizard&rsquo;s tower room. It has avoided the hermitage residents and was largely ignored by them.</p>
<p>Virgil fled the island the previous night when the drowned ones attacked, but now that the characters have seemingly defeated them, the gull has returned to its home. It continues to watch the party despite any attempts to shoo it away. Having observed the characters' actions against the drowned ones, the ex-familiar believes that they might be the sort of heroes who could finish Archais&rsquo;s work and end the undead menace.</p>

(The scroll found in <strong>area area 9</strong> will be useful in that regard if none of the characters have this ability.) The gull relates the events of the &ldquo;<strong>area Background</strong>&rdquo; section to the best of its knowledge. It does not know the specifics about <em>Tammeraut</em>&rsquo;s crew, but it does know that the drowned ones are victims of that fateful sinking.</p>
<p>Virgil knows the location of the <em>Tammeraut</em> and can guide the characters there. Based on the attack tonight, the gull correctly deduces that <em>Tammeraut</em>&rsquo;s crew is active once more and must be stopped.</p>

To accomplish this, the character must earn Virgil&rsquo;s trust, contemplate the nature of conjuration magic, and finally cast <wc-fetch type=spell>find familiar</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p><strong>Virgil&rsquo;s Trust:</strong> For Virgil to consider becoming a character&rsquo;s familiar, that character must reseal the Pit of Hatred.</p>
<p><strong>Research:</strong> The character must spend time researching the nature of familiars that have bonded with new masters. When the character feels ready, they must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check. The DC for this check is reduced by 1 (to a minimum DC of 10) for each day the character spent in research beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>Casting the Spell:</strong> The character must have Virgil present for the casting of <wc-fetch type=spell>find familiar</wc-fetch>. They must burn twice the normal amount of material components to complete the restoration of the gull.</p>
<p><strong>Success:</strong> If the characters end the threat posed by the drowned ones, Virgil is indebted to them for avenging his former master. The bird follows the group and does what it can to help. It can warn of danger, carry notes or messages, and so forth. Use the stat block for a hawk, but increase its Intelligence to 9.</p>

The charts in Archais&rsquo;s journal give the exact location in nautical coordinates. Alternatively, a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check discerns the likely spot where the ship sunk.</p>
<p>Virgil also knows the location of the Pit of Hatred, having accompanied Archais there several times while the wizard was alive. If all else fails, he can guide the characters to the proper locationâ€”flying ahead and circling the site. The Pit of Hatred is two miles south of Firewatch Island and can be rowed or sailed to in about half an hour.</p>
<p>The bay is 300 feet deep above the Pit of Hatred, and characters won&rsquo;t be able to anchor a boat there unless they brought along quite a lot of rope. Certain items in that treasure are invaluable to a party that plans to investigate the wreck, but the characters might also require and seek out additional resources before they do so. See &ldquo;Unusual Environments&rdquo; in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide for information on underwater environments, and see &ldquo;Underwater Combat&rdquo; in chapter 9 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook.</p>

When the characters descend to the wreck and approach the Pit of Hatred, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rotting skeleton of a war galley&rsquo;s stern looms up from the ocean bottom ahead. The sinking ship broke in half during its descent, its bow section gone missing but its stern plunged backward into the seafloor like a spike.</p>
<p>The sandy bed around the wreckage is scattered with partially buried bones and debris. As you approach the wreck, the water becomes unnaturally cold, and the schools of fish that swarmed in the waters above are conspicuously absent.</p>

If the effect is dispelled, it returns in 24 hours.</p>
<p>While the effect is active, celestials cannot enter the area. Each time another sort of non-undead creature enters the area, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (<wc-roll>4d8</wc-roll>) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creature must also make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw when it enters the area, gaining vulnerability to necrotic damage on a failed save.

The rest of the slab is buried. If it is pulled out (requiring a successful DC 15 Strength check), it is found to be inscribed with ancient runes. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check deduces that the slab is the product of magic. A subsequent successful DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check confirms it was made using a <wc-fetch type=spell>stone shape</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>The runes are in Elvish. They communicate a warning to stay away from the sealed rift and the horror that lies below.</p>

Alternatively, characters can swim down into the stern&rsquo;s interior from the top of the ship, where the bow is missing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interior of the sunken ship is a ruin. The decks have all but collapsed, creating a tangled maze where ooze and muck cling to sundered timbers and beams. An eerie, many-colored light pulses from the depths of the hull.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rotten tangles of timbers and bulkheads are weak after ten years underwater and can be pushed through with relative ease.</p>
<p>A large hole in the buried stern of the wreck allows easy access to a darkened cavern that opens up beneath broken slabs of stoneâ€”the remains of the seals that once blocked the opening of the pit.</p>
<p>As the characters enter the wreck, a number of drowned ones that stayed behind from the most recent assault on Firewatch Island take notice. Three Drowned Blade, one drowned ascetic, and one drowned assassin lurk inside the ruined <em>Tammeraut</em> and attack as soon as the characters enter. The undead do not pursue fleeing characters beyond the 300-foot hemisphere of dark energy that surrounds the rift.</p>

<p>A pulsating light composed of unnatural colors permeates this underwater cavern. The stern of the ship has broken through the cavern&rsquo;s fifteen-foot-high ceiling near the center of the area. The nauseating light reveals a hideous array of piled bones, many of which clearly once belonged to humanoidsâ€”far more bones than could be accounted for by the crew of a single sunken ship.</p>
<p>A shallow alcove opens up to the north, with a rotting sea chest set before it, leaning against the rough stone wall. Within the alcove, a funnel-shaped hollow in the cavern floor terminates at a narrow hole in the bedrock below. The pulsing light emanates from this hole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cavern is all that remains of what was once a jagged chasm in the seafloor. The mound of bones represents both the crew of <em>Tammeraut</em> and others who have succumbed to the ocean&rsquo;s perils, all preserved by the rift&rsquo;s dark magic. The hollow to the north is the access point to the ancient evil that has imbued the Pit of Hatred with its sinister aura.</p>
<p><em>Tammeraut</em>&rsquo;s captain, Syrgaul Tammeraut, resides in this chamberâ€”transformed into a twisted monster known as a drowned master (see appendix C). Syrgaul is the conduit through which the pit&rsquo;s evil essence once again spreads its dark influence into the world. Feeding off the captain&rsquo;s rage and hate as he died, the energy of the rift animated <em>Tammeraut</em>&rsquo;s crew and turned them into drowned ones. Though the drowned ones can range abroad, Syrgaul is forever trapped within the rift near the source of his dark unlife.</p>
<p>As the characters explore this area, Syrgaul and one drowned blade rise from the pile of bones and attack.</p>

In addition to being the source of the pulsating light, the vent is the center and source of the area&rsquo;s dark <wc-fetch type=spell>hallow</wc-fetch> effect. This narrow opening continues down for hundreds of feet beneath the ocean bottom, never widening.</p>
<p>Sealing this vent is the only way to lay Syrgaul&rsquo;s spirit to rest. Doing so also prevents the evil from further corrupting those who drown in the area. One easy method of sealing it is to use the flask of <wc-fetch type=item>sovereign glue</wc-fetch> from the hermitage to affix a plug over the opening (the substance hardens even underwater). Spells such as <wc-fetch type=spell>stone shape</wc-fetch> can also seal off the vent. When the vent is sealed, the <wc-fetch type=spell>hallow</wc-fetch> effect surrounding the rift immediately ends.</p>

The surviving hermits abandon the island, but a new group settles there before long. Or, Feldrin Kane, the Uskarn bailiff, might deed the island and fortress to the characters as a reward for ending the threat of the drowned ones. Of course, such a reward comes with the expectation that the characters would use the place to protect and defend the settlements of the nearby coast.</p>
<p>If the characters depart Firewatch Island before nightfall and the drowned ones' second attack, the undead become a greater threat. Now that they&rsquo;ve exhausted the nearby prey, the undead make it to the mainland in their nightly wanderings. Attacks on coastal roads and villages become more commonâ€”with the drowned ones adding all their victims to their growing hordeâ€”and unless they are somehow checked, Syrgaul&rsquo;s forces become the scourge of both land and sea in the entire region.</p>
<p>Even if the characters turn back the drowned ones' assault but fail to close the rift, the evil influence of the pit strengthens and begins to extend outward. All those who have drowned in the bay are gradually harvested by the remaining drowned ones and transformed into undead, until Syrgaul has an army of drowned corpses at his command. What terrible atrocities the undead captain might visit upon the nearby settlements are up to you.</p>
<p>Even with the rift closed off, the Pit of Hatred might continue to be a lurking threat. With the seal restored, the evil beyond is left to festerâ€”frustrated and perhaps seeking ways to break free, stronger and more deliberate than before.</p>
<p>Above all, the question remains: what is the source of the rift&rsquo;s evil? Perhaps the characters will return to the pit as more accomplished adventurers, seeking some way to descend the vent, find out what presence is down there, and destroy it once and for all.</p>

The deep regions of the sea are fertile ground for those demons and cultists who can take advantage of it. Far from the blinding light of the sun and overlooked by many of the demons' traditional foes, a deep-sea portal to the Abyss can spawn many demons and warp the world around it to an irreparable degree before it is discovered.</p>
<p>Pirates and similar outlaws are fertile ground for worshipers, and those captains who achieve success and infamy might draw the eye of any number of Abyssal patrons. As befits their chaotic nature, demon lords tend to offer power and impart blessings as the opportunity presents itself rather than create a comprehensive, long-term plan.</p>
<p>If you want to extend the concept presented in this adventure to cast a longer shadow over your campaign, the following notes provide some guidance and ideas for what might come next.</p>

Orcus offers undeath to his mortal followers as a lure to bring them deeper into his power while unleashing them as a terror of the waves.</p>
<p>The scheme showcased in <em>Tammeraut&rsquo;s Fate</em> is a good example of how Orcus and his minions take advantage of the sea. They march along the seabed to strike at coastal villages and recruit more living dead to their legions. Although the characters might have slain Syrgaul and destroyed the Pit of Hatred, Orcus and his followers continue to plot and plan.</p>

<p>In this continuation of the story, a powerful priest of Orcus forms a network of allied pirate captains. The ship crews are augmented by zombies and skeletons, and, unknown to the pirates, the priest can spy through the undead. Captains who prove treacherous are quickly slain and replaced with more amenable allies.</p>
<p>As the pirates gain control of the seas, the priest is free to establish a domain of Orcus with a great portal to the Abyss at its center. It&rsquo;s up to the characters to track down and defeat the pirate fleet.</p>

Off the coast, near heavily trafficked sea lanes, cultists of Orcus create a gateway on the seabed that links to the Abyss. The water above swirls and plunges downward, creating a whirlpool that devours ships and sea life.</p>
<p>Living creatures pulled to the bottom of the whirlpool are slain, warped with Abyssal energy, and unleashed into the sea as undead creatures. Unless someone finds the gate, slips through it into the Abyss, and destroys the unhallowed site found on the other side, the whirlpool will unleash a horde of undead sailors and sea creatures that can transform the region around it into a dead zone.</p>

This place, the Island of Bones, serves as a port of call for pirates serving Orcus.</p>
<p>The island swarms with undead creatures that perform repairs on ships, unload loot, and protect the place from attack. More important, it serves as the center of an unholy theocracy founded by priests of Orcus and dedicated to calling their master to the Material Plane.</p>
<p>As the island grows, a massive palace fit for the Lord of the Undead himself arises from the bones. Within its depths, a portal to the Abyss slowly forms as more and more mortal sacrifices are made to Orcus.</p>
<p>With a fleet of pirate captains at their call and the devouring gyre cutting off sea travel, the priests of Orcus threaten to overwhelm the region with their undead hordes. Their efforts, of course, are resisted by the characters and whatever forces the locales can muster.</p>
