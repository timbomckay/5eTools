<p>This adventure builds on the events of two previous adventures, The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh and Danger at Dunwater. The following section provides a summary of those adventures for characters who did not participate in the missions.</p>
<p><em>The Final Enemy</em> is designed for four to six characters of 7th level. If you want to use story-based character advancement (see chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide), the characters gain a level for completing this adventure.</p>

Brown and Don Turnbull bring the Saltmarsh trilogy to a conclusion in this 1983 adventure. As befits TSR UK&rsquo;s talent for creating unique scenarios, <em>The Final Enemy</em> challenges players to plan and carry out reconnaissance on a dangerous sahuagin lair.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added an epic final battle where the characters have a chance to lead a final, decisive assault on the sahuagin fortress.</p>

These adventurers discovered that the alleged haunting of the house was a ruse devised by a gang of smugglers importing contraband. The adventurers overcame the smugglers in the house, then boarded their ship and routed the rest of the gang. The smuggling operation quashed, the adventurers were rewarded by the grateful Saltmarsh authorities.</p>
<p>But even after the smugglers were routed, a danger remained. The adventurers told the town council that they discovered evidence that the smugglers had been selling weapons to a nearby colony of lizardfolk. Their deduction was corroborated by Oceanus, a sea elf who was being held prisoner aboard the smugglers' ship when the adventurers made their assault.</p>
<p>Now fearful that the lizardfolk planned to assault Saltmarsh, the town council asked the adventurers to seek out the lizardfolk lair and deal with the threat. The adventurers journeyed to the lair, but they discovered that there was no threat to Saltmarshâ€”at least not from the lizardfolk. In fact, the lizardfolk were preparing to go to war against a tribe of sahuagin, a brutal horde that a year ago drove the lizardfolk from their original home. Determined to regain their ancestral home, the lizardfolk had begun purchasing weapons and were negotiating alliances against the sahuagin with the merfolk and the locathah in the region; the koalinth were also approached but refused to join the alliance. The lizardfolk hoped not only to expel the sahuagin and regain their home, but also to deal the sahuagin enough of a blow to discourage them from further aggression.</p>
<p>After discovering the intentions of the lizardfolk and realizing that the sahuagin were the true threat to Saltmarsh, the adventurers escorted two lizardfolk officers back to meet with the town council and ask the aid of the humans of Saltmarsh in the battle to come.</p>
<p>Now, with the sahuagin threat revealed and new alliances formed, the town council of Saltmarsh once again needs heroesâ€”those accomplished enough to infiltrate the sahuagin stronghold and return with knowledge that will bring about the downfall of the final enemy.</p>

<p>The meeting is also attended by several members of each faction that has allied with Saltmarsh against the sahuagin. Unless the party&rsquo;s actions in the previous adventure drove away any potential allies, the following representatives are present (with others in the vicinity).</p>
<h5 id=lizardfolk>
<a href=#lizardfolk class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Lizardfolk</h5><p>Two Lizardfolk Scaleshield (see appendix C) named Garurt and Vyth represent their queen&rsquo;s interests. They are severe, no-nonsense soldiers. The lizardfolk have set up a camp outside Saltmarsh where a dozen warriors are quartered, with the prospect of more to come. Assuming the lizardfolk are present at the meeting, they provide precious information to the council about their former lair (see &ldquo;A Great Gift&rdquo;).</p>

Before this attack can be correctly planned and executed, a small group is needed to make a preliminary excursion into the fortress. The information gained by this reconnaissance team (see &ldquo;<strong>area The Mission</strong>") will allow the allies to plan a proper attack. The full assault will be launched fourteen days after the reconnaissance team returns, assuming the mission succeeds at least in part. The council&rsquo;s hope is that the characters will accept this assignment.</p>

It occupies an island in the estuary of the Javan River, some fifty miles west and south of Saltmarsh. A coastal headland covers one flank of the island, which is connected to the mainland by a stone causeway.</p>
<p>The lizardfolk explain that this site is their former lair, and it consists of a series of natural passages and caves honeycombing the interior of the island. You should give players information about the former lizardfolk lair and the surrounding area, including but not limited to the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lair is a three-level cave system inside a rocky island. Remarkably, the island seems to have sunk into the surrounding sea, leaving only the top one-third visible from above the water.</li>
<li>The main entrance is now a large cave that faces the seacoast.</li>
<li>The lizardfolk made few changes to the place, only adding stairs to connect the levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sahuagin have made drastic changes to their former lair, beyond submerging the two lower levels beneath the water. All the alterations to the lair made by the sahuagin are described in the &ldquo;<strong>area Sahuagin Stronghold</strong>&rdquo; section below.</p>
<p>If the lizardfolk are not present at the meeting, the map and the related information are provided by scouts who have explored the area without attracting any attention from the sahuagin.</p>
<h4 id=mission-goals>
<a href=#mission-goals class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Mission Goals</h4><p>The objectives of the mission, which must be accomplished if the reward is to be gained, are fourfold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Determine the strength of the sahuagin force: how many warriors, lieutenants, and other battle-ready troops are present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locate important areas within the fortress: where are the warriors barracked, the officers quartered, and the leaders housed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discover any significant defensive measures: traps, areas readied specifically for defense, and other dangers the attacking force must avoid or overcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discover how advanced the sahuagin preparations are and when they might mount their first attack.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=approach-by-sea>
<a href=#approach-by-sea class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Approach by Sea</h3><p>If the characters want to travel by sea, the council provides them with a modified keelboat with two pairs of oars, two rowboats, and a step-down mast, large enough to accommodate the characters and any reasonable amount of equipment. Navigation and propulsion of the craft is handled by two members of the town guard (Guard), who pilot the boat but do not disembark when the characters reach their destination. (If the characters experienced Danger at Dunwater, this boat is of the same sort as the one they used in that adventure.)</p>
<p>Upon arriving near the stronghold, the characters must decide where to disembark and how best to approach the fortress itself. If the lizardfolk are present, they recommend a daylight landing at the river mouth. In any event, the keelboat will not come ashore or drop anchor anywhere near the island. The characters are expected to use the rowboats to get to shore while the keelboat sails well out of view of the fortress for the duration of the party&rsquo;s mission. At a predetermined signal or after some period of time, the keelboat will return to see if the characters are ready to be collected.</p>

They will likely need to fight some of the sahuagin, but must remain quiet as often as possible to avoid becoming overwhelmed. If they can achieve the mission goals without combat, they&rsquo;re playing smart and well. The intent is to get the players to think tactically and avoid unnecessary fights against a superior foe. Reward the characters' efforts to move past areas filled with sahuagin undetected, but do not hesitate to have the sahuagin react if the characters behave carelessly.</p>

When the lizardfolk laired there, the island was almost entirely above sea level. Thadrah, the sahuagin high priestess of Sekolah, worked ritual magic that sank the island by lowering the seabed.</p>
<p>The cave entrance that once provided the lizardfolk access to the lowest level of the island caves has been submerged in 80 feet of water. The stone causeway that previously led from the shore to the cave entrance now leads to a new set of stone doors built by the sahuagin.</p>
<p>The fortress depicted in this adventure is not a typical sahuagin settlement. This is a singular situationâ€”an experimental, fortified base in coastal waters from which sahuagin forces can exert an iron hand of domination over all races inhabiting the adjacent waters and coastal region. If this experiment proves successful, the sahuagin plan to construct more bases of this sort until their control over all waters and coasts is complete, and maritime commerce is at their mercy.</p>
<p>The sahuagin have renovated the fortress to conform with their plans. The two lower levels of the fortress have been completed, with work on the uppermost level still in process. A further lowering of the seabed and a final internal reorganization will complete the preparations. Twenty or thirty days after the adventure takes place, the sahuagin plan to mount their first offensiveâ€”and Saltmarsh is indeed their target.</p>
<p>If the characters enter the fortress through area 1 (and if they deal with the guards in areas 1 and 2 without drawing attention), they find most of the upper level empty and bare. Construction is still going on in area 19, and the noise of that work echoes through some of the level. Anywhere between area 19 and the points marked with a â€  symbol in the corridors on the map, the characters can hear faint chinking, banging, and tapping noises if they stop to listen, and these noises become progressively louder as the listeners approach area 19.</p>
<p>The other two levels of the fortress are underwater. To achieve their objectives, the adventurers must use magical means to navigate these areas.</p>

The rock is clean and dressed; all surfaces are smooth, all corners are near-perfect right angles, and all floors are level (except in the cave portion of cave 60, which has been left natural, and parts of area 19). The uppermost dry level has an eerie, clinical air.</p>

Although they are humanoid in form, they have a mindset closer to that of predatory sharks than the outlook of humans or other land dwellers.</p>
<p>Like sharks, sahuagin are at their most aggressive when their prey spills blood in the water. Their Blood Frenzy trait represents this increased ferocity. Though it can prove a significant edge in a fight, it also saddles them with a critical tactical challenge. Sahuagin affected by Blood Frenzy are at best reluctant to disengage from combat. Rather than withdraw in the face of defeat and find reinforcements, they might instead press the attack.</p>
<p>As an optional rule to reflect this ferocity, a sahuagin that comes within 30 feet of a hostile creature that doesn&rsquo;t have all its hit points must use an action to make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the sahuagin&rsquo;s Blood Frenzy takes over as normal, and the creature either stands its ground or advances to attack in melee. On a successful save, the sahuagin retreats or escapes if possible, temporarily fighting off the influence of the trait. If the sahuagin&rsquo;s move takes it farther than 30 feet from all hostile creatures, the situation resets, and another saving throw is called for whenever it again comes within 30 feet of an injured enemy.</p>

Unless the characters are extremely stealthy and careful, they are bound to encounter a patrol at some point. A guard patrol attacks on sight, unless the characters are disguised or have some other way to make it appear they deserve to be here.</p>
<p>A patrol consists of five sahuagin, one sahuagin coral smasher (see appendix C), and one sahuagin champion (see appendix C) drawn from the roster in <strong>area area 24</strong>. If that area is depleted of sahuagin, no more patrols are sent out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A rock outcropping thrusts up from the sea to form an island here, just offshore. It reckons to be five hundred feet in diameter and is separated from the shoreline by a span of about two hundred feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guards who are rowing or sailing the keelboat won&rsquo;t come anywhere within several hundred feet of the island. They prefer to drop off the characters (in their rowboats) on the eastern edge of the area, but if the characters ask, they will sail around the south side of the islandâ€”always giving it a wide berthâ€”so the characters can disembark somewhere else along the perimeter.</p>
<p>After the characters take to their boats, they can decide to come ashore on the mainland and approach the fortress on foot, or they might row around the island to look for clues about what lies inside. When the characters come close enough to the island to see details of the exterior or the causeway, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The island is bare of vegetation other than mosses, lichens, seaweed, and the occasional clump of coarse grass. No wildlife appears present, but for a few clouds of insects and small mollusks. In stark contrast to other sites along the coast, no seabirds can be seen near the island.</p>
<p>As reported by the scouts, a long stone causeway leads southward from the marshy coastline, crossing the entire span just above the waterline. By looking south from the coast, you can see that it ends at a ledge with a set of large stone doors just beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allow the characters to plan and execute their approach, using the following information.</p>

North Entrance and Guard Post</h4><blockquote>
<p>You stand on a rock ledge about thirty feet wide. Ahead, set into the vertical rock surface, is a pair of large stone doors, each ten feet high and five feet wide. The surface of the doors is featureless, with no visible handles, except for a rectangular aperture six inches wide by four inches high cut in the center of the left-hand door, about six feet above ground level. A flat metal plate covers this aperture from the inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the day, the doors are barred on the inside. At night, the doors are unbarred, since sahuagin use the doors to access the causeway and enter the marsh. The sahuagin guards in area 1 are overconfident; they don&rsquo;t keep a close eye on the causeway.</p>
<p>As long as the characters approach the doors quietly, they do not alert the guards beyond. Tampering with the doors will alert the guards, who demand (in Sahuagin) to know who is trying to enter.</p>
<p>The guards can be tricked into opening the doors, but since sahuagin intelligence is high, this will not be an easy task. A character who can communicate with the sahuagin, and who makes a successful DC 18 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check, convinces the guards to open the doors for the party.</p>
<p>The doors are not magically locked and can be opened with appropriate spells or enough brawn. The doors (AC 16, 45 hit points, damage threshold 12) can be forced open by a character who makes a successful DC 18 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>Once the characters are inside, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see a bare, spartan room. Ahead, a short corridor off the room ends in a closed bronze gate. To your left, a single stone bench runs along the east wall. To your right on the opposite wall hangs a large metal gong; a short metal bar leans against the wall below it.</p>
<p>Several sahuagin glare at you as they move to attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six sahuagin, two Sahuagin Coral Smasher (see appendix C), and one sahuagin champion (see appendix C) guard the entrance. If the door is forced open, one of the sahuagin immediately moves toward the west wall to ring the gong, while the remaining guards defend the entrance. If this creature is slain or otherwise prevented from ringing the gong, no other defender takes its place.</p>
<p>A sahuagin can use its action to ring the gong. If the gong is rung three times, the sahuagin in areas 2 and 12 recognize the alert signal and rush to the scene as quickly as possible. The gong cannot be heard on any other level of the fortress.</p>
<h5 id=guarded-gate>
<a href=#guarded-gate class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Guarded Gate</h5><p>Two sahuagin stationed in area 2 are not initially visible to the characters. They are responsible for keeping guard over the gate that separates the entrance from the rest of the lair.</p>
<p>The gate is normally closed and down. It is raised and lowered by means of a chain and pulley mechanism fastened on the north wall inside area 2, on the east side of the gate. Under normal circumstances, it takes 3 rounds to raise or lower the gate, but an emergency device allows the raised gate to be dropped in a split second with a muffled clang (not audible in any of the occupied areas on this level other than area 1).</p>
<p>The gate (AC 18, 50 hit points, damage threshold 14) can be forced open by a character who makes a successful DC 18 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

The net falls when a creature in area 2 releases the rope that holds it in place. The net can easily be spotted by anyone who looks toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>When a creature releases the net, a 10-foot-square net falls from the ceiling, covering the area in front of the gate in area 1. Each creature standing under the net as it falls must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch>. A creature must make a successful DC 14 Strength check to free itself or another creature from the net. If the net takes 30 slashing damage, it is destroyed and all creatures <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> by it are freed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To your right, along the east wall runs a shallow trough cut into the stone floor. This channel is stained and traces of a brown liquid shine wetly.</p>
<p>To your left, along the west wall, dozens of manacles hang from the wall at waist height.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The slaves that have been toiling to enlarge and alter the fortress for their sahuagin captors spend their few hours of rest in here. At one time, forty slaves served in the stronghold, as attested to by the forty pairs of chains equally spaced along the wall. As the construction work nears its end, the sahuagin have disposed of all but a few workers. Most of the slaves were sacrificed in the summoning ritual performed by high priestess Thadrah.</p>
<p>Food for the slaves, in the form of a light brown, watery gruel, is poured into the trough from time to time, though the slaves are not given utensils of any sort and must do their best with their hands.</p>
<p>The trough stops 10 feet from the northern wall. In the northeast corner of the room, the sahuagin have installed very rudimentary sanitary facilities which, however crude, are kept surprisingly clean.</p>
<p>One human slave (commoner) named Elmo lies dying in the northwest corner of this room. Elmo is too weak to call out to the characters, though he can speak with them if they approach.</p>

In a weak and raspy voice, he tells his story. Relate the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is a wizard and the leader of a party of adventurers from the Hold of the Sea Princes, sent by the Prince of Monmurg to investigate the strange goings-on in the former lizardfolk lair.</li>
<li>He and his companions were equipped to explore underwater but never got that far. As soon as they gained entry (at area 1), they were immediately attacked by large numbers of sahuagin.</li>
<li>All his comrades were killed in the battle that followed. He was taken prisoner. Since then, he has worked as a slave, laboring on the building efforts.</li>
<li>He and his companions had several magic items to aid them with underwater exploration, but these items were confiscated by the sahuagin (see <strong>area area 18</strong>). He does not believe the sahuagin know of their magical properties.</li>
<li>He recently witnessed the performance of a terrible ritual in which many slaves were sacrificed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Close to death, Elmo can no longer work or even walk. The sahuagin have not even bothered to kill him for food, considering his sparse frame not worth the effort.</p>
<p>Elmo&rsquo;s mind is too damaged to recall any useful information about the layout of the lower levels. He does remember a tremendous earthquake occurring some time ago. (The earthquake was caused by the high priestess&rsquo;s ritual, though Elmo does not know this.)</p>

<p>If the sahuagin in this area have not been alerted when the party enters, continue with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten slaves, working by torchlight, smooth and dress the unfinished exterior walls of the hall. Each slave is shackled at the ankles with a length of chain and wears a metal collar. Several sahuagin oversee the slaves as they work, while others rest and chat near the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>This large room features walls and floor covered in gray tiles, the ceiling covered in white. Tiled pillars support the ceiling and run down the length of the area on either side of the center.</p>
<p>An altar is built against the northern wall of this chamber. Its stone base is covered in carved shark eyes that stare out in all directions. The startlingly realistic eyes are inset with dark stones that reflect the chamber&rsquo;s dim blue light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters look into the chamber without interrupting the ritual taking place, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Glowing symbols and strange designs are engraved into the walls of this place, casting an eerie light throughout the chamber. Three chanting sahuagin dressed in ceremonial robes float near the altar, their arms raised toward the ceiling, which is some thirty feet above. Carvings of shark&rsquo;s eyes adorn the altar&rsquo;s front, each varied in shape and size. The gory remains of unidentified creatures rest</p>
<p>atop the altar; blood rises like smoke upward past the sahuagin. Two large and squirming sacks flank the altar.</p>
<p>A massive two-headed shark, its fins adorned with bands of pearl and gold, swims in circles above the altar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Noise of combat in this area does not attract attention from any other occupied area. Even if a sahuagin patrol passes near the temple during combat inside, it is not at all surprised to hear such noises. The priestesses are a strange bunch, in the average warrior&rsquo;s opinion, and conduct some very noisy ceremonies in their templeâ€”this must just be another one. It is a different matter, of course, if a patrol sees combat occurring.</p>
<p>Three Sahuagin Priestess are performing the ritual at the altar. Each sack contains ten sahuagin hatchlings that are no threat and are automatically slain if attacked. The Maw of Sekolah (see appendix C) swims menacingly overhead. The priestesses have disadvantage on any <wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch> checks to detect the characters. While the ritual is being maintained, the Maw of Sekolah does not attack the characters, even if it becomes aware of them. Interrupting the ritual, however, has dire consequences for everyone in the temple.</p>

It must be performed for another hour before it is considered complete. Every 10 minutes, one of the priestesses sacrifices a sahuagin hatchling, whose blood rises and feeds the avatar.</p>
<p>The priestesses stop chanting only if they are attacked. They know the ritual must be maintained, or their lives are forfeit.</p>
<p>If the characters cause any of the three priestesses to stop chanting, the Maw of Sekolah descends and devours two of the priestesses immediately before attacking the party. The remaining priestess fights alongside the shark.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The Maw of Sekolah and a single sahuagin priestess make for a hard fight for a party of four 7th-level characters. For each additional character in the party, allow one more priestess to survive to maintain the same degree of difficulty.</p>

It managed to escape its fate as a gladiator, in part due to its strangely high level of intelligence.</p>
<p>The lobster has limited telepathy, though it cannot explain how it came to have this ability. It can communicate with any other living creature within 10 feet. The lobster has named itself Shern, and it desperately wants to escape the fortress.</p>
<p>If Shern becomes aware of the characters, it attempts to communicate with one of them despite not being able to convey language. It knows the following information, which it communicates through feelings and projected images:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A terrible monster lives in the temple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two four-armed sahuagin rule this fortress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bulk of the sahuagin forces are on the fortress&rsquo;s lowest level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the party frees Shern by returning it to the ocean, it can lead the characters to a sunken treasure (of your design) a few miles south of the fortress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Shern knows the layout of the two lowest levels of the fortress, including areas where large number of sahuagin gather. The lobster accompanies the characters if it senses they will help it escape. Shern hopes to hide in a backpack, a cloak pocket, or a hood while the characters explore the rest of the fortress.</p>

<p>The corridor leads to a great hall, its floor tiled in black, the walls in coral pink, and the ceiling in white. Black-tiled pillars are regularly placed in a line slightly south of the eastâ€“west axis. To the north of the pillars, long tables have been placed end to end, with benches to either side. At the midpoint of the north wall, an archway opens onto a passage. This ornate archway is decorated with elegant black and gold designs evocative of waves and monstrous sea creatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the sahuagin banquet hall. Since sahuagin prefer to eat informally when individuals feel hunger, this hall is used only for important functions, such as to celebrate a great victory or entertain visiting nobles. The ceiling is 30 feet high.</p>
<p>The tables and benches can accommodate two hundred sahuagin with space to spare, but at present the area is empty.</p>
<p>The stone head in the semicircular niche in the center of the south wall is not clearly visible to characters standing under the western or eastern arch. As soon as a character moves to a position from which they can be observed, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A semicircular niche has been hollowed into the center of the south wall. The floor of the niche sits seven feet off the ground. On the shelf formed there stands a large carved stone head, visibly battered and disfigured. The features can still be recognized as those of a lizardfolk. The head is about twice as large as life size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the lizardfolk lived here, one of their proudest possessions was a 10-foot-high statue of Semuanya, their deity. When the sahuagin took over the fortress, they destroyed the statue, breaking it into stone fragments and leaving only the head, before the baron intervened. Instead of allowing them to destroy the head, the baron decided to keep it as a memento of his triumphâ€”not only over the lizardfolk, but over their very way of life. He had his warriors remove it to the banquet hall and place it so that it faced him as he sat on his throne. It is an object of scorn and derision among the sahuaginâ€”rarely does a sahuagin pass it without making a malicious, usually obscene, gesture.</p>

<p>Pale blue marble pillars stand to the east and west. The dais is of the same pale blue marble, while the throne is black coral. The ceiling is tiled in pale blue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming the occupants have not left, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the throne sits an oversized sahuagin. This creature has four arms. In his right upper hand, he holds a large trident. His two lower hands grip the arms of his throne.</p>
<p>Floating next to the throne, on the creature&rsquo;s right-hand side, is an adult female sahuagin holding a long staff tipped with a jumble of shark jaws and teeth.</p>
<p>In front of the throne and at the foot of the dais, three adult sahuagin float with their backs to you. Two float with bodies held rigid, while the third pleads before the throne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sahuagin speaking to the baron is complaining about offensive remarks made by another sahuagin. The sahuagin wants the baron to punish the offender. The baron is growing impatient with the pettiness and is close to feeding all involved parties to the Maw of Sekolah in area 37.</p>
<p>Baron Kepmak (sahuagin baron) sits on his throne, while high priestess Thadrah (sahuagin high priestess; see appendix C) stands at his side. The complainant is a sahuagin, while the two floating at attention are Sahuagin Champion (see appendix C). Two Shell Shark (see appendix C) swim high above the throne; they are the pets of the baron and defend him if he is attacked.</p>
<p>If the characters observe the interaction for 10 minutes, they witness the baron rise and issue an angry judgment before turning to consult with the priestess on other matters. The two sahuagin champions and the sahuagin complainant leave through the main entrance in the south and travel to their respective posts.</p>

Sleeping Quarters of the Baroness</h4><p>As the party approaches the area, presuming the occupants have not previously left, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two female sahuagin, their voices raised, appear to be arguing in the room ahead. Though the words might be incomprehensible, the sense is quite clearâ€”one berates the other, and that one pleads for mercy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters can see into the room, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The room is tiled in light blue, and frescoes on the ceiling depict various forms of marine life. A large and opulent seaweed bed fills the southwest corner. In the center of the north wall hangs a large mirror with a filigree metal frame. Below the mirror lies a coffer, its lid off and propped against the wall. A key is in the lock of the coffer.</p>
<p>A large and intimidating female sahuagin warrior looms above a normal-sized sahuagin who swims submissively before her. The large one has four arms, and one of its hands holds a single gold earring, which she shakes at the cowering sahuagin. A third sahuagin in dark robes floats near the doorway, looking bored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baroness Seklaz (sahuagin baron) looms over her servant (sahuagin), accusing it of stealing one of her earrings. The earring is, in fact, lost behind the throne in area 42, where the baroness dropped it days ago. A single sahuagin wave shaper (see appendix C) waits by the entryway. It was summoned to dispose of the servant and waits for the baroness&rsquo;s command to do so. If the characters enter combat with these three, the sahuagin servant slips away to find a nearby patrol (see &ldquo;<strong>area Patrols in the Lair</strong>") and returns with reinforcements in 5 rounds.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The object on the table is a silver medallion, about 2 inches in diameter, on a fine silver chain. One side of the medallion carries an engraving of a shark. The other side&rsquo;s engraving depicts a dozen tridents offset in a circle to form the shape of a star; this symbol is the baron&rsquo;s personal seal.

There is no lock behind the keyholeâ€”the actual locking mechanism is a slot hidden under the lid of the coffer. This slot cannot be opened by using thieves' tools. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check notices the slot and realizes that the coffer is trapped. The trap can be disarmed by a character who makes a successful DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

<p>Attempting to pick the keyhole or opening the chest without disarming the trap triggers the trap. If the trap is triggered, a large blade swings out, slicing anyone within 5 feet of the coffer.

The characters farthest into the room can prevent its escape if the players state their intentions quickly enough. Exercise care, for even if the two upper levels have been completely cleared of sahuagin, there are enough sahuagin in various parts of this level to devastate the party.</p>
<p>If the wave shaper gets away, it returns to join the fight along with a guard patrol (see &ldquo;<strong>area Patrols in the Lair</strong>"). These forces arrive in this area <wc-roll>3d6 + 6</wc-roll> rounds after the wave shaper makes its escape.</p>

Sea Lion Cell</h4><blockquote>
<p>Angry snarls arise from this cell. Inside, an angered sea lion roars and thrashes in the confined space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sea lion (see appendix C) was captured by the sahuagin along with its triton master (see cell 50d) and is now being caged until a suitable opponent can be found to pit against it in the arena. If the triton is not with the characters when this door is opened, the sea lion attacks with extreme ferocity. If the triton is with the characters, he can calm and control the sea lion.</p>

Decay-Filled Cell</h4><blockquote>
<p>The water in this is cell is fouled by the rotting corpse of a large sea serpent of some kind. A stone slab along the north wall lies askew and partially broken on the unfinished floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characters experience some difficulty in opening this door, even with the bar removed. This is because the giant eel (Borgas&rsquo;s companion) died in the confined space, and its body partially blocks the door. Continued pressure and a successful DC 13 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check eventually opens the door sufficiently for a character or Borgas to squeeze inside.</p>

In fact, the eel hastened its own death by vainly battering at the walls and door. Now it hangs, bloated and distended, in the water and occupies most of the available space.</p>

<p>The sahuagin decided they no longer needed this entrance, so they blocked off the passage by leaning a stone slab up against the north wall of this cell.</p>
<p>The thrashings of the giant eel in its death throes have partially dislodged this slab, so if a character enters the room, a small opening is discovered in the north wall. Now that the slab has been moved, it is easy to open the passage up completely. Beyond, the passage and the guard room still exist in their original dimensions, though the entrance is now under 70 feet of water.</p>
<p>Borgas is noticeably upset to discover the death of his companion, and this discovery makes him even more determined to get revenge on the sahuagin.</p>

<p>A humanoid figure is being held in this sparse cell of unfinished stone.</p>

<p>The figure is Kysh (see appendix C), who was captured by the sahuagin along with his sea lion companion (see <strong>area cell 50b</strong>). He is being held until a suitable opponent can be found for him to fight in the arena. He has been stripped of his possessions.</p>
<p>He is more than willing to go along with the characters on their adventure, then returns to his own tribe after leaving the fortress.</p>
<p>Kysh was <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> when he was brought into the fortress, so he has no idea of its layout, nor does he know what has happened to his sea lion companion.</p>

<p>The secret door opens into a short passage that leads south into a larger area. At the far end of that open area, perhaps fifty feet away, stands a closed coffer with canvas sacks propped against it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The threshold of the chamber at the south end of the passage is trapped with a <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>The glyph can be spotted by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check while examining the floor in this area. The glyph is triggered if any creature passes from the corridor into the chamber. If that occurs, each creature within 20 feet of the glyph must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>5d8</wc-roll>) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>

It can be opened by a character who makes a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.</p>
<p>The coffer is also trapped. A character who searches the coffer and makes a successful DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check discovers the trap. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools can disarm the trap. The trap is triggered if a character fails to disarm it, or if the coffer is opened without first disarming the trap.</p>
<p>When the trap is triggered, a stone slab springs out of the ceiling in the passage, knocking the secret door closed (and with sufficient force to break the tridents if they are being used to support the secret door).

<p>The sound of the slab being smashed rings through the nearby rooms, drawing the attention of the three Sahuagin Champion (see appendix C) in area 50, if they are still alive. They arrive 5 minutes later with twelve sahuagin and two Sahuagin Coral Smasher (see appendix C) drawn from area 60.</p>

Arena</h4><p>This area consists of two distinct sections, so the description of what the characters see depends on which section the party enters from.</p>
<h5 id=central-arena>

Double doors at the south end of a downward-sloping passage running south from the crossroads near the torture chamber (area 50) provide access to this section. These doors can be barred from the outside with bronze bars set in brackets, preventing any combatant from escaping in that direction.</p>
<p>The walls of the arena rise 30 feet from the floor to the lower edge of the gallery, which is supported by pillars at each corner. A clear quartz dome, slightly convex, rests on the four edges of the gallery and arches over the arena, so that at its center the dome is about 40 feet above the arena floor.</p>
<h5 id=gallery>
<a href=#gallery class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Gallery</h5><p>The gallery is tiered on three levels, with 10 feet between levels, so that the uppermost tier is 50 feet above the floor of the combatants' area and the ceiling 10 feet higher than that. Access to the gallery is provided by short passages in the east, south, and west walls. Each tier has a row of stone benches that surround the area, except for flights of steps that provide access to the benches.</p>
<p>On the lowest tier, in the center of its south side, the row of benches is broken by three special seats. The center and western seats, the largest and most ornately decorated, are reserved for the baroness and baron, and the eastern seat, larger and better decorated than an ordinary bench but not so finely as the baroness&rsquo;s and baron&rsquo;s, is for Blademaster Makaht. Any sahuagin of lesser rank caught in these seats immediately goes to the top of the list for the next fight in the arena.</p>
<p>On important occasions, more than two hundred sahuagin fill the arena to watch the sport, but at present fifty-five are here: forty-nine sahuagin, five Sahuagin Champion, and Blademaster Makaht (sahuagin blademaster, see appendix C), who sits apart from the rest in his special seat. The warriors and lieutenants are scattered around the area. All the sahuagin in the gallery have their usual weapons and equipment.</p>
<p>In the arena proper, two sahuagin are locked in mortal combat, each unarmed and tearing at the other with vicious claws and bone-crushing bites.

Anyone entering the arena floor draws immediate attention, unless they are <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> or otherwise cloaked from view. If the sahuagin spot intruders, the crowd erupts into chaos. The five champions rush forward to attack, while <wc-roll>1d6 + 4</wc-roll> sahuagin swim down to block the exit. The rest watch the fight with glee, rushing to join the fight if three or more champions are slain or the characters rush past the sahuagin guarding the exit.</p>
<p>An intrusion into the gallery is not as dangerous, since the sahuagin are absorbed by the battle taking place below. A successful DC 10 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check allows a character to avoid drawing attention so long as they don&rsquo;t attempt to interact with the sahuagin. Otherwise, use the sahuagin&rsquo;s passive <wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch> as normal to see if activity attracts their attention. If characters are spotted in the gallery, assume that <wc-roll>2d6 + 2</wc-roll> sahuagin and <wc-roll>1d3</wc-roll> Sahuagin Champion (see appendix C) are within 30 feet and rush to attack. The rest watch and cheer the fight, joining in if more than half the original attackers are slain. If the characters flee, the original attackers pursue them, but the rest return to watching the entertainment.</p>

Its mechanism is correspondingly larger than others elsewhere. The bronze gate is normally closed (down), though it can be raised and lowered by one of two chain and pulley mechanisms. One is fastened to the wall on the inside of the cavern, to the east of the cave mouth. The other is outside the cavern, also to the east of the cave mouth. Under normal circumstances, it takes 3 rounds to raise or lower the gate, but an emergency device can drop the gate in a split second with a muffled clang (not audible on this level other than in areas 58 and 59).</p>
<p>The gate (AC 18, 100 hit points, damage threshold 14) can be forced open by a character who makes a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

They are granted Saltmarsh citizenship, and a house is set aside for them to use, rent-free, whenever they wish.</p>
<p>If you want to continue the story, proceed with the &ldquo;<strong>area The Assault</strong>.&rdquo; That information assumes that the characters take on a role in the upcoming invasion of the stronghold and provides guidance on how to play out those events. If you and the group want to move on to other challenges instead, a full-scale assault on the fortress takes place about fourteen days after they return to Saltmarsh. The sahuagin are wiped out and their plans destroyed, thus removing the threat to the town and the races living in the area. The lizardfolk return to their home and, though the Saltmarsh militia suffers losses, the area settles down to its former peaceful ways.</p>

They begin with an attack by Saltmarsh&rsquo;s militia against the entrance (area 1). Once the sahuagin commit troops to the defense of the gate, the aquatic factions of the alliance will attack through the entrances on <strong>area level 3</strong>. The humans will then keep the sahuagin busy on <strong>area level 1</strong> while their allies sweep through the lower levels and eventually crush the defenders in a pincer attack.</p>
<p>The Saltmarsh council explains that the characters' role is to serve as a strike force, disrupting the sahuagin defenses and slaying as many foes as possible before the main force engages the enemy. A cunning party should have the chance to take out numerous defenders, open the gate in area 1, and slay sahuagin leaders, possibly without ever raising an alert. It&rsquo;s a daunting task, but the party has their allies' full confidence.</p>

Success in the battle is determined by how many victory points the characters accrue during their infiltration. Every time the party defeats a foe or achieves a strategic goal, they gain victory points, as detailed on the following table. Keep a running total of how many victory points the party earns during their incursion. If the group caused particular damage to the sahuagin fortress on their first visit, feel free to grant them a discretionary 5 to 15 victory points based on the scope of the destruction.</p>

Saltmarsh and its allies only give the characters a brief period to weaken the sahuagin forces. While you should encourage the party to be hasty, keep the exact time before their allies' attack nebulous. This allows you to have troops from Saltmarsh show up in the party&rsquo;s defense should they get into trouble.</p>
<p>For you, though, the party has 30 rounds.</p>
<p>After the characters enter the fortress, start a tally of how many rounds they&rsquo;ve spent inside, encouraging them to act fast before they&rsquo;re discovered. After set periods of time the sahuagin begin to notice that something is not as it should be and raise their alert level (see &ldquo;<strong>area On Alert</strong>').</p>
<p>At the end of this period, check the party&rsquo;s victory points. If their number of victory points meets or exceeds 75, &ldquo;<strong>area The Baron&rsquo;s Counterattack</strong>&rdquo; occurs (see below). The party has unlimited time to face Baron Kepmak, but at the end of this encounter, the characters' allies appear and the assault draws to a close.</p>
<h4 id=on-alert>
<a href=#on-alert class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>On Alert</h4><p>Prepared for attack, the sahuagin forces readily charge into battle once they know the assault has begun. The fortress rings with the sounds of sahuagin preparing for battle, echoing with clanging weapons and Sahuagin shouting. If the party is wily, they might use the din to their favor and catch their foes unaware.</p>
<p>The general combat readiness of the sahuagin is summarized by whether or not they are on alert. When the party reaches the fortress, the sahuagin are not alert. This can change quickly, though. If any of the following circumstances occur, the alert is raisedâ€”the sahuagin know the enemy is among them!</p>
<ul>
<li>When noted in an encounter area.</li>
<li>A sahuagin flees battle and reaches Blademaster Makaht in area 10 or Baron Kepmak via area 19.</li>
<li>The party makes any sort of noise greater than angry shouting and clashing armsâ€”particularly noisy magical effects like <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=spell>thunderous smite</wc-fetch>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reinforcements</strong>. As soon as the fortress goes on alert, sahuagin reinforcements begin roaming the halls. These reinforcements only appear once the characters have already engaged with an area&rsquo;s defenders. Every <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> rounds after combat begins in an area, <wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll> sahuagin and 1 sahuagin champion (see appendix C) arrive. If the PCs manage to defeat all the sahuagin in a room (plus reinforcements) no further defenders appear.</p>
<p>During these encounters, it&rsquo;s possible that the party could be overwhelmed by foes. Consult the &ldquo;Handling Mobs&rdquo; section in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide to help deal with large numbers of enemies.</p>

If the PCs retreat, they meet Saltmarsh&rsquo;s human attackers as they launch their offensive. The attack force thanks the characters for their efforts and charges into battle.</p>
<p>If the PCs are defeated, Saltmarsh&rsquo;s forces arrive just in the nick of time. While some troops pull the characters to safety, the remainder overwhelm the remaining sahuagin forces. The characters are ferried back to Saltmarsh, all the while being hailed as heroes willing to sacrifice everything for the cause.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the characters confront Baron Kepmak, they might decapitate the sahuagin forces, practically ending the offensive before it begins.</p>
<p>In any of these cases, refer to the Triumph or Failure sections afterward.</p>

North Entrance and Guard Post</h4><p>The sahuagin have tightened their defenses at the north entrance. Expecting an attack, they no longer use the causeway and keep this gate sealed at all times of day. As the gate provides the only access to level 1 of the fortress, the party&rsquo;s first challenge will be getting in.</p>
<p>How the character&rsquo;s infiltrate the fortress is up to them, but might include the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The party can sneak in magically by using the potions the Saltmarsh council provided.</li>
<li>The party might try to talk their way in, but the challenge of deceiving the sahuagin guards has increased, requiring a DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check. If the party previously tricked their way into the area this way, they have disadvantage on these checks.</li>
<li>The party might want to try sneaking into the fortress elsewhere, but they&rsquo;ll find even tighter security underwater. The success of whatever clever infiltration methods the party proposes is left to your discretion.</li>
</ul>
<p>However the party gains access to the fortress, they find the north entrance under heavy guard. A sizable force of ten sahuagin, two Sahuagin Champion, and two Sahuagin Coral Smasher hold ranks here, prepared to face whatever attack might come. Any conflict here that lasts for more than 5 rounds puts the entire fortress on alert.</p>
<p>The room&rsquo;s other features are the same as detailed earlier in the adventure, though the net trap has been disabled. The gate functions the same, though, which is of especial note as the party&rsquo;s allies would be greatly aided if it were open when they attack.</p>

Unfinished Barracks</h4><p>The sahuagin are using these barracks as a forward command post. Thirty sahuagin, three Sahuagin Champion, five Sahuagin Coral Smasher, and Blademaster Makaht (sahuagin blademaster, see appendix C), if he survived, are now stationed here.</p>
<p>If the party engages the sahuagin in combat here, the defenders' numbers and central location on the level instantly raise the alert.</p>
<p><strong>Treasure</strong>. Amid mundane supplies rests a box made from tightly grown pink coral. Inside is a necklace of adaptation and 4 potions of healing.</p>

<a href=#19-hall-1 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>19. Hall</h4><p>The sahuagin mount a desperate defense here, determined to protect their leaders below. An elite force of six Sahuagin Champion and four Sahuagin Coral Smasher maintain a guard post here.</p>
<p>If the defenders are slain, a shrill battle cry rises from the level below. Regardless of how long the party has spent in the fortress, Baron Kepmak and his honor guard join the fray. Begin the following encounter.</p>
<h4 id=the-barons-counterattack>
<a href=#the-barons-counterattack class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Baron&rsquo;s Counterattack</h4><p>Incensed by his forces' slaughter, Baron Kepmak, leader of the sahuagin forces, takes the field. This is your chance to add a dramatic finale to the assault, as the baron leads eight Sahuagin Champion into battle. The baron roars as he launches into battle, attacking the largest character and cursing them in Sahuagin (calling them ichor-less tide pool dwellers and the like).</p>
<p>If the party wishes to flee, the baron&rsquo;s gargling guffaws follow them down the hall, but he and his retinue do not pursue. The party soon encounters the Saltmarsh forces, which appreciatively spirit them to safety.</p>
<p>However, if the party stands and defeats the baron, all sahuagin in the room stop attacking when he falls, their shock turning to terror. In the momentary silence, the sound of booted feet precedes the appearance of Saltmarsh&rsquo;s forces. The sahuagin swiftly retreat. The bulk of Saltmarsh&rsquo;s troops take up pursuit, with a few remaining to escort the characters away. The party has done enough. It&rsquo;s time for them to claim their reward.</p>
<h3 id=failure>
<a href=#failure class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Failure</h3><p>It&rsquo;d be challenging for the characters to achieve no victory point during the attack, but if they flee at the first sign of opposition or don&rsquo;t participate after agreeing to do so, they face a chilly welcome upon returning to Saltmarsh. The assault went on without them, but the allied forces took heavy losses, only barely managing to defeat the sahuagin. The characters are asked, politely but firmly, to leave the Saltmarsh area. The town councillors wish them a safe journey, as long as it is one way.</p>
<h3 id=triumph>
<a href=#triumph class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Triumph</h3><p>Regardless of how the party&rsquo;s strike unfolded, the characters are sent to the rear of the attacking force for rest, healing, and eventual escort back to Saltmarsh. The characters' degree of success depends on how many victory points they achieved during the assault. Several hours after returning to Saltmarsh, the town council informs the party of the attack&rsquo;s success and presents them with their reward:</p>
<p><strong>Pyrrhic Victory (Less than 50 victory points</strong>). The alliance was victorious, but with heavy casualties. The sahuagin relinquish their lair and escape, perhaps returning later for revenge. The Saltmarsh council rewards the party for their effort, granting them 700 gp and a favor: free passage aboard a ship headed to any seaport within a week&rsquo;s travel of town. This favor can be called in whenever the characters please.</p>
<p><strong>Victory (51 to 125 victory points</strong>). The alliance carries the day with expected casualties. The Saltmarsh council rewards the party with 1,000 gp and one random item from Magic Item Table F in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide (alternatively, you might just grant them one or more of the following: a <wc-fetch type=item>+1 weapon</wc-fetch> of their choice, <wc-fetch type=item>+1 shield</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=item>+1 wand of the war mage</wc-fetch>, or a <wc-fetch type=item>Bag of Tricks</wc-fetch>). Additionally, the council grants them a favor, as noted above, but to any destination within a month&rsquo;s travel of town.</p>
<p><strong>Total Victory (126 or more victory points</strong>). The characters effectively gained control of the entire first level of the fortress. This caused the remaining sahuagin to panic before Saltmarsh&rsquo;s forces crashed into their defenses. Any sahuagin fortunate enough to escape are unlikely to ever be heard from again. The Saltmarsh council rewards the party with 1,400 gp, three random items from Magic Item Table F in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide (or, you might just grant them one or more of the following: a <wc-fetch type=item>+1 weapon</wc-fetch> of their choice, <wc-fetch type=item>+1 shield</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=item>+1 wand of the war mage</wc-fetch>, or a <wc-fetch type=item>Bag of Tricks</wc-fetch>). They also grant the characters a favor, as noted above, but to wherever the characters please.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus (Baron Kepmak Defeated</strong>). If the characters managed to defeat Baron Kepmak, Saltmarsh&rsquo;s forces find the sahuagin in utter chaos, the strong ineffectually trying to force panicked, weaker troops into the fray. In addition to their other rewards, the Saltmarsh council rewards the party with an additional 1,000 gp and a treasure long held in the town vault, a <wc-fetch type=item>Figurine of Wondrous Power, Silver Raven</wc-fetch>. In the aftermath, the characters are hailed as heroes by the allied forces. They never have to pay for a drink in Saltmarsh again.</p>
