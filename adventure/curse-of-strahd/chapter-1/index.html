This chapter gives you the information you need to prepare for the adventurers' journey into those mists. The chapter first outlines the history and goals of Count Strahd von Zarovich so that you are prepared for what awaits the characters. In the &ldquo;<strong>area Fortunes of Ravenloft</strong>&rdquo; section, the chapter walks you through the tarokka card reading that helps set the stage for the adventure&rsquo;s action, and the chapter closes with adventure hooks that you can use to draw the characters into the horror of Barovia.</p>

After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family&rsquo;s enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic beauty that he decided to settle there.</p>
<p>Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him. Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality.</p>
<p>Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his love for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. Sergei eventually took up residence at Ravenloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother&rsquo;s body in a crypt beneath the castle.</p>
<p>Strahd&rsquo;s attention soon turned to Tatyana, a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished Tatyana with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd&rsquo;s efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer Sergei. Strahd&rsquo;s pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple&rsquo;s love until the day of Sergei and Tatyana&rsquo;s wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered Sergei and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased Sergei&rsquo;s bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. Tatyana hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd&rsquo;s pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/CoS/000-cos01-01.png alt=undefined class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>But Strahd did not die. The Dark Powers honored the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire.</p>
<p>After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of Barovia. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.</p>
<p>Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consortsâ€”none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire&rsquo;s game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren&rsquo;t so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion.</p>
<p>Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the Dark Powers to release him.</p>

<p>I am the Ancient. I am the Land.</p>

<h4 id=turn-ireena-kolyana>
<a href=#turn-ireena-kolyana class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Turn Ireena Kolyana</h4><p>Strahd&rsquo;s unrequited love for Tatyana drove him to slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman Ireena Kolyana in the village of Barovia and felt extreme dÃ©jÃ  vu. Ireena looked exactly like Tatyana! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of Tatyana, and thus he seeks to claim her.</p>
<p>Strahd&rsquo;s evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her homeâ€”the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Baroviaâ€”and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 gives details about Ireena and where to find her in the village of Barovia.</p>
<h4 id=find-rudolph-van-richten>
<a href=#find-rudolph-van-richten class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Find Rudolph van Richten</h4><p>Although he is usually focused on making Ireena Kolyana his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten has come to Barovia. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching Barovia for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 describes the town of Vallaki, where van Richten currently resides incognito.</p>
<h4 id=search-for-a-successor-or-consort>
<a href=#search-for-a-successor-or-consort class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Search for a Successor or Consort</h4><p>Strahd can sense the arrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter Barovia, he shifts his attention from Ireena Kolyana and van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn&rsquo;t arrive at this conclusion immediately.)</p>
<p>Strahd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piquedâ€”even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.</p>

<a href=#roleplaying-strahd class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Roleplaying Strahd</h3><p>Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn&rsquo;t suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.</p>
<p>When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of Tatyana, but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn&rsquo;t have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.</p>
<p>In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers stillâ€”not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won&rsquo;t yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd&rsquo;s humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he&rsquo;s preying on Ireena Kolyana, he tells them that Ireena&rsquo;s body is the host for Tatyana&rsquo;s soul, and Tatyana&rsquo;s soul belongs to him.</p>
<p>Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a timeâ€”playthings to possess or discard as he desires.</p>
<p>If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn&rsquo;t honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.</p>
<h3 id=when-strahd-attacks>
<a href=#when-strahd-attacks class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>When Strahd Attacks</h3><p>Strahd isn&rsquo;t a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from itâ€”he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading. His combat details are available in <strong>area appendix D</strong>.</p>
<p>When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day. If they&rsquo;re indoors, he tries to charm or goad a character into inviting him inside (along with his vampire spawn, if they are present). Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena.</p>
<p>These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.</p>

Before you run this adventure, you must draw cards from a deck to determine the following elements of the adventure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strahd&rsquo;s location inside Castle Ravenloft</li>
<li>The placement of three important treasures that can be used against Strahdâ€”the <em>Tome of Strahd</em>, the <wc-fetch type=item>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</wc-fetch>, and the <wc-fetch type=item>Sunsword</wc-fetch></li>
<li>The identity of a powerful ally in the fight against Strahd</li>
</ul>
<p>This card reading can make the adventure different each time you play it.</p>
<p>At some point during the adventure, the characters are likely to meet Madam Eva, the old Vistani seer (see chapter 2, <strong>area area G</strong>), who can perform the same card reading for them. Characters can also have Ezmerelda d&rsquo;Avenir perform a card reading for them, provided she has her deck of tarokka cards. Ezmerelda&rsquo;s cards are hidden in her wagon (chapter 11, <strong>area area V1</strong>).</p>
<p>Appendix E shows all the cards of the tarokka deck and summarizes their symbolic meanings.</p>

To do so, separate the numbered cards from the face cards and jokers, and treat them as two separate decks: the common deck (the numbered cards) and the high deck (the face cards and jokers).</p>
<p><strong>Common Deck:</strong> Each suit in a regular deck of playing cards corresponds to a suit in the tarokka deck. The ace cards represent the &ldquo;1&rdquo; cards in the tarokka deck, and the &ldquo;10&rdquo; cards represent the &ldquo;master&rdquo; cards in the tarokka deck.</p>
<p>Hearts = Glyphs Diamonds = Coins Spades = Swords Clubs = Stars</p>
<p><strong>High Deck:</strong> Each jack, queen, king, and joker corresponds to a card in the tarokka high deck.</p>

If the characters have their fortunes read in the adventures, do the card reading again, out loud for the players' benefit. Substitute the new results for the old ones.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re ready to begin the card reading, remove the fourteen cards with the crown icon (the high deck) and shuffle them. Then shuffle the remaining cards (the common deck), keeping the two decks separate. Draw the top three cards from the common deck and lay them face down in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Then draw the top two cards from the high deck and lay them face down in the 4 and 5 positions, as shown below:</p>

(Some cards offer two possible results, A and B; in such a case, you can pick the one you prefer or that better suits the circumstances of the adventure.)</p>
<p>Strahd senses that this NPC is a danger to him and tries to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible. This NPC, whoever it ends up being, gains the following additional action:</p>
<h5 id=inspire>

<p>Each of the NPCs described in this section has a role to play in the adventure, even if that individual isn&rsquo;t indicated in the card reading. For the one so designated, however, the information in this section regarding the NPC&rsquo;s behavior takes precedence over whatever is said elsewhere in these pages; that NPC is extraordinary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Artifact (Joker 1</strong>)</p>
<p>Look for an entertaining man with a monkey. This man is more than he seems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Rictavio (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>), who can be found at the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki (chapter 5, <strong>area area N2</strong>). Normally reluctant to accompany the characters, Rictavio changes his tune if the characters tell him about the card reading. He sheds his disguise and introduces himself as Dr. Rudolph van Richten.</p>
<p>The characters might think that Gadof Blinsky, the toymaker of Vallaki (<strong>area area N7</strong>), is the figure they seek, because he has a pet monkey. If they speak to him about this possibility, Blinsky jokes that he and the monkey are &ldquo;old friends,&rdquo; but if the characters ask him to come with them to fight Strahd, he politely declines. If the characters tell him about the tarokka reading, Blinsky admits that he acquired the monkey from a half-elf carnival ringmaster named Rictavio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beast (Jack of Diamonds)</p>
<p>A werewolf holds a secret hatred for your enemy. Use her hatred to your advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to the werewolf Zuleika Toranescu (see chapter 15, <strong>area area Z7</strong>). She will accompany the characters if they promise to avenge her mate, Emil, by killing the leader of her pack, Kiril Stoyanovich.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. Broken One (King of Diamonds</strong>)</p>
<p>Your greatest ally will be a wizard. His mind is broken, but his spells are strong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok (see chapter 2, <strong>area area M</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Broken One (King of Diamonds</strong>)</p>
<p>I see a man of faith whose sanity hangs by a thread. He has lost someone close to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Donavich, the priest in the village of Barovia (see chapter 3, <strong>area area E5</strong>). He will not accompany the characters until his son, Doru, is dead and buried.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Darklord (King of Spades)</p>
<p>Ah, the worst of all truths: You must face the evil of this land alone!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no NPC who can inspire the characters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. Donjon (King of Clubs</strong>)</p>
<p>Search for a troubled young man surrounded by wealth and madness. His home is his prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Victor Vallakovich (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N3t</strong>). Realizing that the characters are the key to his salvation, he enthusiastically leaves home and accompanies them to Castle Ravenloft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Donjon (King of Clubs</strong>)</p>
<p>Find a girl driven to insanity, locked in the heart of her dead father&rsquo;s house. Curing her madness is key to your success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Stella Wachter (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N4n</strong>). She grants the party no benefit unless her madness is cured. With her wits restored, Stella is happy to join the party and leave her rotten family behind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seer (Jack of Clubs)</p>
<p>Look for a dusk elf living among the Vistani. He has suffered a great loss and is haunted by dark dreams. Help him, and he will help you in return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Kasimir Velikov (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N9a</strong>). The dusk elf accompanies the characters to Castle Ravenloft only after they lead him to the Amber Temple and help him find the means to resurrect his dead sister, Patrina Velikovna.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. Ghost (King of Hearts</strong>)</p>
<p>I see a fallen paladin of a fallen order of knights. He lingers like a ghost in a dead dragon&rsquo;s lair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to the revenant Sir Godfrey Gwilym (see chapter 7, <strong>area area Q37</strong>). Although initially unwilling to accompany the characters, he will do so if the characters convince him that the honor of the Order of the Silver Dragon can be restored with his help. Doing this requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Ghost (King of Hearts</strong>)</p>
<p>Stir the spirit of the clumsy knight whose crypt lies deep within the castle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Sir Klutz the phantom warrior (see chapter 4, area K84, <strong>area crypt 33</strong>). If Sir Klutz is Strahd&rsquo;s enemy, then the phantom warrior disappears not after seven days, but only after he or Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Executioner (Jack of Spades)</p>
<p>Seek out the brother of the devil&rsquo;s bride. They call him &ldquo;the lesser,&rdquo; but he has a powerful soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Ismark Kolyanovich (see chapter 3, <strong>area area E2</strong>). Ismark won&rsquo;t accompany the characters to Castle Ravenloft until he knows that his sister, Ireena Kolyana, is safe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. Horseman (Joker 2)</p>
<p>I see a dead man of noble birth, guarded by his widow. Return life to the dead man&rsquo;s corpse, and he will be your staunch ally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Nikolai Wachter the elder, who is dead (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N4o</strong>). If the characters cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>raise dead</wc-fetch> spell or a <wc-fetch type=spell>resurrection</wc-fetch> spell on his preserved corpse, Nikolai (LN male human noble) agrees to help the characters once he feels well enough, despite his wife&rsquo;s protests. Although his family has long supported Strahd, Nikolai came to realize toward the end of his life that Strahd must be destroyed to save Barovia.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t have the means to raise Nikolai from the dead, Rictavio (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>) gives them a <wc-fetch type=item>spell scroll</wc-fetch> of <wc-fetch type=spell>raise dead</wc-fetch> if he learns of their need. If they&rsquo;re staying at the Blue Water Inn, he leaves the scroll in one of their rooms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B. Horseman (Joker 2)</p>
<p>A man of death named Arrigal will forsake his dark lord to serve your cause. Beware! He has a rotten soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to the Vistani assassin Arrigal (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N9c</strong>). If the characters mention this card reading to him, he accepts his fate and accompanies them. If the characters succeed in defeating Strahd, Arrigal betrays and attacks them, believing that he is destined to become Barovia&rsquo;s new lord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. Innocent (Queen of Hearts</strong>)</p>
<p>I see a young man with a kind heart. A mother&rsquo;s boy! He is strong in body but weak of mind. Seek him out in the village of Barovia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Parriwimple (see chapter 3, <strong>area area E1</strong>). Although he&rsquo;s a simpleton, he won&rsquo;t travel to Castle Ravenloft without good cause. Characters can manipulate him into going by preying on his good heart. For instance, he might go there to help rescue missing Barovians, or to save the life of Ireena Kolyana, who is very beautiful. The characters must somehow deal with Bildrath, Parriwimple&rsquo;s employer, who won&rsquo;t let the foolish boy go to the castle for any reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Innocent (Queen of Hearts</strong>)</p>
<p>Evil&rsquo;s bride is the one you seek!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Ireena Kolyana (see chapter 3, <strong>area area E4</strong>). Her brother, Ismark, opposes the idea of Ireena&rsquo;s being taken to Castle Ravenloft, but she insists on going there once the characters tell her about the card reading. Ireena won&rsquo;t accompany the characters, however, until Kolyan Indirovich&rsquo;s body is laid to rest in the cemetery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. Marionette (Jack of Hearts</strong>)</p>
<p>What horror is this? I see a man made by a man. Ageless and alone, it haunts the towers of the castle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Pidlwick II (see chapter 4, <strong>area area K59</strong>, as well as <strong>area appendix D</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Marionette (Jack of Hearts</strong>)</p>
<p>Look for a man of music, a man with two heads. He lives in a place of great hunger and sorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Clovin Belview (see chapter 8, <strong>area area S17</strong>), the two-headed mongrelfolk. Clovin serves the Abbot out of fear and a perverse sense of loyalty. His job is to deliver food to the other mongrelfolk, whom he abhors. If the Abbot still lives, Clovin doesn&rsquo;t want to earn his Master&rsquo;s ire by attempting to leave, and he refuses to accompany the characters. But if the Abbot dies, Clovin doesn&rsquo;t have any reason to remain in the abbey, so he&rsquo;s willing to come along if he is bribed with wine. Clovin provides no benefit to the party without his viol.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mists (Queen of Spades)</p>
<p>A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia&rsquo;s abbey, near the mists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Ezmerelda d&rsquo;Avenir (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>). She can be found in the Abbey of Saint Markovia (see chapter 8, <strong>area area S19</strong>), as well as several other locations throughout Barovia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raven (Queen of Clubs)</p>
<p>Find the leader of the feathered ones who live among the vines. Though old, he has one more fight left in him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Davian Martikov (see chapter 12, &ldquo;The Wizard of Wines&rdquo;). The old wereraven, realizing that he has a chance to end Strahd&rsquo;s tyranny, leaves his vineyard and winery in the capable hands of his sons, Adrian and Elvir. But before he travels to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd, Davian insists on reconciling with his third son, Urwin Martikov (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N2</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. Tempter (Queen of Diamonds</strong>)</p>
<p>I see a childâ€”a Vistana. You must hurry, for her fate hangs in the balance. Find her at the lake!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Arabelle (see chapter 2, <strong>area area L</strong>). She gladly joins the party. But if she returns to her camp (chapter 5, <strong>area area N9</strong>), her father, Luvash, refuses to let her leave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Tempter (Queen of Diamonds</strong>)</p>
<p>I hear a wedding bell, or perhaps a death knell. It calls thee to a mountainside abbey, wherein you will find a woman who is more than the sum of her parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This card refers to Vasilka the flesh golem (see chapter 8, <strong>area area S13</strong>).</p>

The first time the characters arrive at the foretold location, Strahd is there, provided he hasn&rsquo;t been forced back into his coffin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Artifact (Joker 1</strong>)</p>

<p>He lurks in the depths of darkness, in the one place to which he must return.</p>

<p>Strahd faces the characters in his tomb (<strong>area area K86</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donjon (King of Clubs)</p>
<p>He lurks in a hall of bones, in the dark pits of his castle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strahd faces the characters in the hall of bones (<strong>area area K67</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seer (Jack of Clubs)</p>
<p>He waits for you in a place of wisdom, warmth, and despair. Great secrets are there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strahd faces the characters in the study (<strong>area area K37</strong>).</p>

<p>Ghost (King of Hearts)</p>
<p>Look to the father&rsquo;s tomb.</p>

<p>Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (<strong>area area K88</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Executioner (Jack of Spades)</p>
<p>I see a dark figure on a balcony, looking down upon this tortured land with a twisted smile.</p>

<p>Strahd faces the characters at the overlook (<strong>area area K6</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Horseman (Joker 2</strong>)</p>
<p>He lurks in the one place to which he must returnâ€”a place of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strahd faces the characters in his tomb (<strong>area area K86</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Innocent (Queen of Hearts)</p>
<p>He dwells with the one whose blood sealed his doom, a brother of light snuffed out too soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strahd faces the characters in Sergei&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area area K85</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marionette (Jack of Hearts)</p>
<p>Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby.</p>

<p>Strahd faces the characters in the north tower peak (<strong>area area K60</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mists (Queen of Spades)</p>
<p>The cards can&rsquo;t see where the evil lurks. The mists obscure all!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The card offers no clue about where the final showdown with Strahd will occur. It can happen anywhere you like in Castle Ravenloft. Alternatively, Madam Eva tells the characters to return to her after at least three days, and she will consult the cards again for them, but only to discern the location of their enemy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raven (Queen of Clubs)</p>

<p>Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (<strong>area area K88</strong>).</p>

<p>Tempter (Queen of Diamonds)</p>
<p>I see a secret placeâ€”a vault of temptation hidden behind a woman of great beauty. The evil waits atop his tower of treasure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strahd confronts the characters in the treasury (<strong>area area K41</strong>). &ldquo;A woman of great beauty&rdquo; refers to the portrait of Tatyana hanging in the castle&rsquo;s study (<strong>area area K37</strong>), which contains a secret door that leads to the treasury.</p>

Different ways to get the adventurers to Barovia are described in the sections that follow. Use whichever one you favor.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;<strong>area Plea for Help</strong>,&rdquo; a colorfully dressed stranger approaches the characters while they are staying at a tavern. The stranger delivers a letter from his master, inviting them to the village of Barovia with an urgent request for their assistance. If the characters take the bait, the fog engulfs them as they cross into Strahd&rsquo;s domain.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;<strong>area Mysterious Visitors</strong>,&rdquo; the characters are asked to scare off a band of rowdy travelers who are camped outside the town of Daggerford, on the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The travelers welcome the characters to their camp and invite them to sit by their fire while their elder recounts a tragic tale of a cursed yet noble prince. The characters, lulled into a trance by the fire, awaken to find themselves on a foggy road, delivered to Barovia by their Vistani hosts.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;<strong>area Werewolves in the Mist</strong>,&rdquo; the characters are drawn together by a series of werewolf attacks. The hunt for this pack of lycanthropes leads the characters into a forest, where they are swept into the land of Barovia. This hook assumes the use of the five factions featured in the Adventurers League.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;<strong>area Creeping Fog</strong>,&rdquo; the characters are traveling a lonely road through the woods when the fog engulfs them, spiriting them away to the land of Barovia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To a party of seasoned adventurers such as yourselves, what you see is but another dull tavern in another dull town in some nameless province. It is but another span of time between the challenges of true adventuring.</p>
<p>Outside the tavern, a fog lies over the town this evening. The damp, cobbled pavement glistens as the lights of street lanterns dance across the slick stones. The fog chills the bones and shivers the soul of anyone outside.</p>
<p>Yet inside these tavern walls the food is hearty, and the ale is warm and frothy. A fire blazes in the hearth, and the tavern is alive with the tumbling voices of country folk.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the tavern door swings open, and a hush falls over the room. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His heavy, booted footfalls and the jingle of his coins shatter the silence. His brightly colored clothes are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. Without hesitation, he walks up to your table and stands proudly in a wide stance with folded arms.</p>
<p>In an accented voice he says, &ldquo;I have been sent to you to deliver this message. If you be creatures of honor, you will come to my Master&rsquo;s aid at first light. It is not advisable to travel the Svalich Woods at night!&rdquo; He pulls from his tunic a sealed letter, addressed to all of you in beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table. &ldquo;Take the west road from here some five hours march down through the Svalich Woods. There you will find my master in Barovia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid the silent stares of the patronage, the man strides to the bar and says to the wary barkeep, &ldquo;Fill the glasses, one and all. Their throats are obviously parched.&rdquo; He drops a purse heavy with gold on the bar. With that, he leaves.</p>
<p>The babble of tavern voices resumes, although somewhat subdued. The letter is lying before you. The seal is in the shape of a crest you don&rsquo;t recognize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/CoS/003-cos19-10.png alt="Strahd&amp;rsquo;s Crest" class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>The characters can interrupt the messenger at any time. His name is Arrigal (NE male human assassin), and he is a Vistani. The other tavern patrons regard his people as friendly folk who travel about in covered wagons and usually keep to themselves.</p>
<p>Arrigal describes Barovia as a valley of great beauty and his master as a remarkable man. If the characters question Arrigal about the identity of his master, he claims to serve Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, but in truth he serves Strahd. After delivering the letter, Arrigal mounts his horse and rides off. He doesn&rsquo;t wait for the characters to follow him.</p>
<p>The crest depicted on the letter&rsquo;s seal belongs to Strahd, though the characters have never seen it before. Show the players Strahd&rsquo;s crest.</p>
<p>The letter, which seems to have been written by the burgomaster, was actually penned by Strahd. If the characters read the letter, show the players &ldquo;<strong>area Kolyan Indirovich&rsquo;s Letter (Version 1)</strong>&rdquo; in appendix F. The letter is bait to lure the adventurers to Barovia. If the characters take the bait, they arrive at <strong>area area A</strong> (see chapter 2, &ldquo;The Lands of Barovia&rdquo;).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Duchess Morwen of Daggerford is having guests for dinnerâ€”and you are invited. No strangers to Daggerford, you have come to the town&rsquo;s defense on more than one occasion, and you count Lady Morwen as a friend and a benefactor.</p>
<p>A cool autumn breeze blows through the streets as you make your way to the keep. As you dine on hot, spicy soup and tenderly cooked pheasant, you can tell that the duchess seems more out of sorts than usual. Then a pall comes over the occasion as she voices her concern about a band of wayward travelers camped outside the town&rsquo;s walls. They seemed harmless at first, but Morwen has received reports that they have begun harassing townsfolk and other visitors as they come and go, demanding money and wine, and threatening to put hexes on anyone who doesn&rsquo;t pay up.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the duchess ordered several guards to scare away the mysterious visitors, but they couldn&rsquo;t get the job done. When the guards returned, they spoke sympathetically about the visitors. It seemed as if the guards had been magically charmed.</p>
<p>Morwen doesn&rsquo;t want an armed conflict, but she aims to send a stern message to the visitors and asks you to deliver it on her behalf. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t leave before dawn,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll burn their wagons to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characters are asked to deliver Duchess Morwen&rsquo;s message immediately after dinner.</p>
<p>The travelers are camped on the hill outside the gates of Daggerford, near the road. Guards atop the walls watch the camp closely at all hours.</p>
<p>When the characters approach the camp, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the evening grows dark, you see a dozen men and women gathered around a crackling bonfire. The folk are in good spirits. A few of them sing and dance around the fire while others find happiness in their flasks and wineskins. Three barrel-topped wagons are parked at odd angles. Tied to a nearby tree, grazing, are half a dozen draft horses wearing bright coats with bangles and tassels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The men and women are Vistani. They have no interest in Daggerford. Their orders are to deliver the characters safely to Barovia.</p>
<p>The leader of this group is Stanimir (CN male human), an old man with the statistics of a mage who has the following spells prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cantrips (at will): <wc-fetch type=spell>friends</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>light</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>prestidigitation</wc-fetch></p>

</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Stanimir is joined by his daughter, Damia (CN female human spy), and his son, Ratka (CN male human bandit captain). Nine other Vistani (male and female Bandit) heed Ratka&rsquo;s commands. The six Draft Horse are used to pull the Vistani wagons, which contain their belongings but nothing of value.</p>

If they deliver Duchess Morwen&rsquo;s warning, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stanimir laughs. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We have no wish to make enemies of Lady Morwen. I have a story to tell all of you. First you listen, then we go.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters agree to hear Stanimir&rsquo;s story, he invites them to gather around the fire and hear his tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stanimir fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire. The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire&rsquo;s core.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come from an ancient land whose name is long forgottenâ€”a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from our homes, and now we wander the lost roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.</p>
<p>Stanimir continues. &ldquo;One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn&rsquo;t say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn&rsquo;t give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, â€˜I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will always be safe here.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.</p>
<p>Stanimir&rsquo;s face becomes a somber mask. &ldquo;A curse has befallen our noble prince, turning him into a tyrant. We alone have the power to leave his domain. We&rsquo;ve traveled far and wide to find heroes such as yourselves to end our dread lord&rsquo;s curse and put his troubled soul to rest. Our leader, Madam Eva, knows all. Will you return to Barovia with us and speak with her?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These Vistani refuse to speak the name of their &ldquo;dread lord&rdquo; and provide no additional information. If the characters press them for details, the Vistani reply, &ldquo;Madam Eva has the answers you seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the characters agree to accompany the Vistani, the Vistani lead them south along the Trade Way. After several days of uneventful travel, the mists of Ravenloft engulf the caravan, transporting the characters and the Vistani to Barovia. The Vistani then lead the party safely to their leader, Madam Eva, at <strong>area area G</strong> (see chapter 2). The characters arrive at <strong>area area A</strong> and are taken through <strong>area areas B</strong>, <strong>area E</strong>, and <strong>area F</strong> on the way to Madam Eva&rsquo;s camp. If the characters rid themselves of their Vistani hosts before reaching Madam Eva&rsquo;s camp, they&rsquo;re on the own.</p>
<p>If the characters decline Stanimir&rsquo;s invitation, the Vistani are disappointed but leave as promised. A day or two later, use the &ldquo;<strong>area Creeping Fog</strong>&rdquo; adventure hook or some variation of it to draw the characters into Barovia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Werewolves in the mist!&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve heard these dreaded words spoken again and again by farmers, merchants, and adventurers alike. The hamlets east of Daggerford have fallen prey to a pack of werewolves that spills out of the Misty Forest on nights of the full moon, cloaked in crawling mist that seems to follow them wherever they go. The beasts spread death and mayhem, slaughtering adults and stealing children before retreating back into the woods. Others have tried to combat the werewolf menace, with little success.</p>

<p>The Misty Forest lies thirty miles east of Daggerford. Before the characters embark on their quest, those who have faction allegiances receive additional information described in the sections that follow. Take the players aside, and read them the boxed text for their faction.</p>

<p>A Lords' Alliance operative from Waterdeep named Eravien Haund comes to Daggerford bearing news that alliance agents have not only captured one of the werewolves but also conducted a thorough interrogation before putting the creature out of its misery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eravien Haund (LN male half-elf noble) imparts the following information to fellow Lords' Alliance members and tells them not to share it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The werewolf pack has almost a dozen members. The leader of the pack is a man named Kiril.</li>
<li>The werewolves come from a distant land called Barovia. The Lords' Alliance has no information about it.</li>
<li>The werewolves worship a deity called Mother Night.</li>
<li>The werewolves leave and return to Barovia through some kind of ancient portal. (This is a deduction on Eravien&rsquo;s part, based on the werewolf prisoner&rsquo;s vague description of how the pack gets to and from Barovia.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eravien believes that he can gain prestige within the Lords' Alliance if he learns the whereabouts of the &ldquo;ancient portal&rdquo; that the werewolves are using and destroys it. He is convinced that the portal represents a danger not only to Daggerford but also to Waterdeep. Any Lords' Alliance character who agrees to destroy it is given a <wc-fetch type=item>spell scroll</wc-fetch> of <wc-fetch type=spell>magic weapon</wc-fetch>.

Yarak was slain, and Davra wants revenge; she wants the head of the werewolf pack leader.

Characters can follow the werewolves' tracks into the Misty Forest. After hours of fruitless searching, the characters are engulfed by thick fog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The woods darken as the trees begin to close ranks, their needle-covered arms interlocking to blot out the sun. The shroud of mist that covers the ground turns into creeping walls of gray fog that silently envelop you until you can&rsquo;t see more than a few feet in any direction. Soon, even the werewolf tracks disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter which direction they go, the characters come to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to <strong>area area A</strong> (see chapter 2). As an alternative, you can have them enter Barovia near Krezk (see chapter 8).</p>

They are quietly borne to the edge of Barovia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The woods are quiet this night, and the air grows chill. Your fire sputters as a low mist gathers around the edges of your camp, growing closer as the night wears on. By morning, the fog hangs thick in the air, turning the trees around you into gray ghosts. Then you notice these aren&rsquo;t the same trees that surrounded you the night before.</p>
