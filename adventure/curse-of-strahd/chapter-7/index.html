<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>When Strahd drove his enemies into the valley long ago, determined to annihilate them, the last thing he expected to encounter was a silver dragon.</p>
<p>The dragon, who called himself Argynvost, had come to the valley years earlier in the guise of a nobleman named Lord Argynvost. The dragon didn&rsquo;t lair in the valley solely because of its idyllic beauty. He knew of a place called the Amber Templeâ€”a repository of evil power guarded by the forces of good. Argynvost wanted to make sure that whatever was trapped inside the Amber Temple wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to escape, so he built his fortified mansion, Argynvostholt, close by.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span></p>
<p>Like many silver dragons, Argynvost was extraordinarily wealthy, and he was comfortable living among humans while disguised as one of them. He used his resources to attract other champions of good, and valorous knights flocked to the valley to join Lord Argynvost&rsquo;s prestigious Order of the Silver Dragon. Only those who were initiated into the order were told of Lord Argynvost&rsquo;s true nature.</p>
<p>During the war between Strahd and his foes, the Order of the Silver Dragon drove away malefactors searching for the Amber Temple. It also sheltered Strahd&rsquo;s enemies and proved more than a match for Strahd&rsquo;s battle-weary soldiers. But the early victories of the order didn&rsquo;t win the war. Even with Argynvost on their side, the knights were ultimately overwhelmed when Strahd&rsquo;s reinforcements swept into the valley. Those forces slew the last of the knights and battled the dragon inside Argynvostholt. After the dragon was slain, Strahd had its corpse hacked to pieces, stripped to the bone, and transported to Castle Ravenloft as a trophy.</p>
<p>Since the dragon&rsquo;s death, Argynvostholt has become a haunted ruin, a former bastion of nobility and light turned into a place of desolation and unrest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was looking at dead men. Before another hour passed, I&rsquo;d send them wailing on their way to rotting hell. All of them.</p>

Horngaard returned as a revenant and swore to avenge the destruction of the order. His zeal was so great that it also brought back the spirits of several other knights, who rose as revenants under Vladimir&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>The vengeful revenants killed many of Strahd&rsquo;s soldiers, and whenever the undead knights were cut down, their spirits found new corpses to inhabit. Though the knights were grossly outnumbered, they waged war for months and slew hundreds of foes.</p>
<p>When Strahd died and became a vampire, Vladimir&rsquo;s knights should have gone to their everlasting rest, but their spirits couldn&rsquo;t leave Strahd&rsquo;s domain. They marched to Castle Ravenloft and were confronted by the Vistani seer Madam Eva, who told them Strahd had died, only to become a prisoner in his own land, tormented by the death of his beloved Tatyana and the murder of his brother Sergei.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/CoS/076-cos07-02.png alt=undefined class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>After receiving that news, Vladimir ceased his advance and led his knights back to Argynvostholt. He realized that Strahd had already died and been damned to a hell of his own creation. With nowhere else to go and nothing else to do, Vladimir set his knights to killing Strahd&rsquo;s agents and anyone else who might help to ease Strahd&rsquo;s torment. Consumed by hatred, the knights have lost their honor and nobility. Their redemption hinges on whether Vladimir can set aside that hatred. The undead knight can be found brooding in the ruins of Argynvostholt.</p>
<p>The spirit of the dragon Argynvost isn&rsquo;t at rest, either. It can sense that the knights have been corrupted, and it reaches out to the characters, hoping they will help the knights find peace. If the characters retrieve the dragon&rsquo;s skull from Castle Ravenloft and place it in the mausoleum of Argynvostholt, the dragon&rsquo;s spirit ascends to the highest tower of the mansion and transforms into a beacon of light that flashes across Barovia. The light of the beacon reminds Vladimir Horngaard of what he has lost, enabling him and his fellow knights to let go of their hatred and find both redemption and rest.</p>

In Barovia, however, a revenant can remain in its body indefinitely, and once it has reaped its vengeance, its soul remains trapped in Barovia.</p>
<p>If the body of a revenant is destroyed before its vengeance is fulfilled, its spirit seeks out a new corpse or skeleton to animate. To determine where the revenant&rsquo;s new body rises, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> and consult the following table.</p>

<p>When the characters first come within sight of Argynvostholt, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High above the river valley juts a quiet promontory upon which looms a sepulchral mansion, its turrets capped with fairytale cones, its towers lined with sculpted battlements. A third of the structure has collapsed, as has part of the roof, but the rest appears intact. A dark, octagonal tower rises above the surrounding architecture.</p>
<p>Out of the fog comes a distant peal of thunder, quickly accompanied by the howling of wolves in the woods below, but the house stands silent, seeming like the fossilized remains of some long-dead thing smote upon the mountainside.</p>

Dragon Statue</h3><blockquote>
<p>Perched atop a ten-foot-wide, ten-foot-high cube of granite is a moss-covered statue of a dragon, its wings tucked close to its body. The statue looks east, toward the mansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fog makes it hard to see the dragon&rsquo;s features from a distance, but close inspection reveals that it&rsquo;s a silver dragon of noble bearing, its spiny frill cracked and broken in many places. The statue is 10 feet tall but looks much more imposing perched on the granite block.</p>
<p>If scrutinized with a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell, the statue radiates an aura of evocation magic. The dragon statue used to breathe a cone of cold as part of a magic trap, but the trap no longer works (see area Q2).</p>

<p>Flagstone steps flanked by stone railings climb to a landing in front of a pair of tall, wooden doors with rusted iron bands and knockers shaped like small dragons. Carved into the lintel above the entrance is the word Argynvostholt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a creature climbs the steps or sets foot on the landing, the dragon statue (area Q1) opens its mouth and exhales a 60-foot cone of harmless cold air, then closes its mouth and doesn&rsquo;t activate again until the next dawn. At one time, the statue would breathe a cone of ice and hail, but its magic has deteriorated over the years.</p>
<p>The doors are unlocked and can be pushed open to reveal a dark foyer (area Q3).</p>

Dragon&rsquo;s Foyer</h3><blockquote>
<p>This room feels like a king&rsquo;s tomb. A grand staircase leads up to stone balconies held aloft by stone pillars and arches. A tall, faded tapestry depicting a nobleman in silver armor hangs from an iron rod above the staircase landing.</p>
<p>Six sets of double doors lead from this foyer. Along the walls, displayed on marble pedestals, are three alabaster busts of handsome men. A fourth bust and its pedestal have been knocked over, and their shattered remains lie strewn across the mosaic floor. Two chandeliers of wrought iron hang from the ceiling like monstrous black spiders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tapestry is torn in places and worthless. It is a portrait of Lord Argynvost. The alabaster busts depict several of the dragon&rsquo;s other human guises. The stairs lead up to the second-floor balconies (<strong>area area Q18</strong>).</p>

<p>Argynvost had the empty sarcophagus converted into a wine cabinet. Now, only shattered wineglasses and decanters are to be found on the shelves. The den&rsquo;s other furnishings include rotted divans, broken chairs, overturned ottomans, and smashed oil lamps.</p>

<p>Have the player characters roll initiative. The fire acts on initiative count 10 and has AC 15, 1 hit point, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes and fills the room with fire, setting fire to the dry furnishings. Each creature in the room must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The fire doesn&rsquo;t attack. On its first turn, if it has not been reduced to 0 hit points, it speaks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fiery dragon hisses as it addresses you. &ldquo;My knights have fallen into darkness. Save them if you can. Show them the light they have lost!&rdquo; With that, the fire burns out.</p>

Wine Storage</h3><blockquote>
<p>Five barrels lie in wooden braces along the walls of this dark, moldy storage room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiding behind the barrels is a wounded elf named Savid (N male dusk elf scout). He has 4 hit points remaining and is grateful for any healing the characters can provide.</p>
<p>Savid lives with the other dusk elves of Barovia in the Vistani camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, <strong>area area N9</strong>). He was searching the woods for a missing Vistani girl named Arabelle when a wandering mob of needle blights accosted him. He was forced to take refuge in the mansion.</p>
<p>Savid, who is more than four hundred years old, volunteers the following useful information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Argynvost was a silver dragon that liked to assume human forms. Argynvostholt was the dragon&rsquo;s home.</li>
<li>In human guise, the noble dragon led a group of knights called the Order of the Silver Dragon. They gave shelter to refugees who had come to the valley to escape Strahd&rsquo;s army. Strahd&rsquo;s soldiers slew the dragon, destroyed the order, and sacked the mansion.</li>
<li>Vistani and dusk elves avoid the mansion, believing that the dragon&rsquo;s ghost haunts it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The wine in the barrels turned to vinegar and evaporated long ago. Emblazoned on the barrels' sides are the name of the winery, the Wizard of Wines, and the name of the wine, Champagne du le Stomp.</p>

<p>A twenty-foot-long table with sculpted dragons for legs stands in the center of this hall. The chairs that surround the table have backs carved to resemble folded dragon wings, and several of the chairs have been overturned or smashed to pieces. Suspended above the table is a crystal chandelier that glows with a soft white light. Standing in windowed alcoves are two life-sized statues depicting knights with dragon-winged helms and shields.</p>
<p>Rainwater trickles through cracks in the ceiling, flowing down the west wall and adding to a large puddle on the floor.</p>
<p>Five sets of wooden doors lead to this hall. The doors in the northeast corner hang open. A pair of leaded glass doors, their panes cracked and broken, stand open between panels of stained glass set into the east wall. These panels depict silver dragons in flight. Beyond the glass doors lies a dark, misty room that appears to be a chapel.</p>

Chapel of Morning</h3><blockquote>
<p>Cracked wooden pillars support a wooden, U-shaped balcony that overhangs this stone-walled chapel. Narrow archways lead to spiral staircases that curl up to the balcony, and a door set into the north wall has a wooden beam barring it. At the east end of the chapel rests a stone altar flanked by iron candelabras. The altar is carved with a rising sun bas-relief. Tall, arching windows set with panels of stained glass decorate the walls behind the altar. One of the windows has been shattered, covering the chapel floor with shards of colored glass and allowing thick fog to enter and fill the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the beacon has not been lit (see <strong>area areas Q16</strong> and <strong>area Q53</strong>), add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the fog, you see three armored figures kneeling before the altar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figures are three Revenant clad in tattered chain mail that affords the same protection as leather armor. Each revenant wields a longsword. If the beacon is lit, the revenants are cleansed of their hatred and laid to rest, and the characters find three armored corpses with longswords lying on the floor in front of the altar.</p>
<p>The revenants, if still active, are blinded by their hate and attack the characters on sight, seeking to drive them out of Argynvostholt. As an action, a revenant attacks twice with its longsword, wielding the weapon with both hands and dealing 15 (<wc-roll>2d10 + 4</wc-roll>) slashing damage on a hit.</p>
<p>Characters who study the room&rsquo;s iconography and orientation (the fact that it draws light from the east) can determine, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check, that the chapel is dedicated to a god of the dawn. Anyone familiar with Barovian religion can conclude that the god in question is the Morninglord.</p>
<p>The balcony (<strong>area area Q24</strong>) is 20 feet high and can be reached by climbing either spiral staircase (area Q14).</p>
<p>Characters who stand near the altar and look up can see the hollow interior of the beacon tower. The tower&rsquo;s lower landing (<strong>area area Q50</strong>) is 60 feet above the chapel floor, and the upper landing (<strong>area area Q51</strong>) is another 20 feet above that.</p>
<p>The bar across the north door is easily lifted from this side. Once the bar is removed, the door can be pulled open to reveal a stone staircase leading down to a cemetery (area Q15).</p>

Cemetery</h3><blockquote>
<p>Tucked behind the mansion is a fog-shrouded cemetery enclosed by a seven-foot-tall fence of wrought iron. In the northeast corner stands a mausoleum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the beacon has not been lit (see areas Q16 and <strong>area Q53</strong>), read the following text when the characters cross the cemetery for the first time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You suddenly feel like someone or something is watching you. Looking up, you spot a well-dressed man with a thick mane of thistledown hair observing you from a high tower window. He draws the curtain and disappears from view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strange man watches the characters through the southeast window of <strong>area area Q42</strong>. He is merely an apparition intended to lure the characters to that room.</p>
<p>The mausoleum is described in area Q16.</p>
<p>The thick fog obscures the fact that five of the graves have been dug up. Closer inspection and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check reveals that the corpses buried there crawled out of the earth. Of the missing corpses there is no sign, but the surrounding fence is intact, which suggests that no one got into the cemetery from outside. (These corpses were animated by the spirits of revenants and clawed their way out.)</p>
<p>A stone staircase curls up the outside of a turret to a flagstone landing in front of a sturdy wooden door. The door is barred from the inside and opens into the chapel (<strong>area area Q13</strong>).</p>

South Alcove</h3><blockquote>
<p>A red velvet curtain hangs in front of an alcove in the southeast corner of this hall. It ripples ever so slightly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the narrow windows in the back of the alcove has a broken glass pane through which a slight breeze passes, causing the curtain to move. When the characters look behind the curtain, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A black cloth covers something atop a white marble pedestal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beneath the black cloth is the severed head of a randomly determined characterâ€”an illusion created by Strahd&rsquo;s consciousness. In actuality, it&rsquo;s an exquisite alabaster bust of a handsome, middle-aged human with a neatly trimmed mustache and beard (Lord Argynvost). The illusion is too strong to be disbelieved, but it can be dispelled if the bust is broken or covered up again.</p>

<p>This T-shaped hallway has branches to the west, east, and south. Three arched windows in the north wall look out over the foggy grounds.</p>

<p>The ceiling in the hall is 20 feet high. The wooden doors to <strong>area areas Q27</strong> and <strong>area Q28</strong> are locked, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to break down. The 10-foot squares in front of the doors (marked T on the <strong>area map</strong>) are trapped. When a character enters one of these squares, a floor-to-ceiling <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of stone</wc-fetch> (created by the spell of the same name) magically appears across the opening on the south wall. At the same time, the Phantom Warrior in areas Q27 and Q28 rush through the doors (which can be freely opened from their side) and attack.</p>
<p>The wall of stone vanishes after 10 minutes, at which time the trap resets. Characters who cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell in the hall can perceive hazy auras of evocation magic in front of the doors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two beds with torn canopies stand against opposite walls with a tattered rug lying on the floor between them. Set into the far wall is a fireplace black with soot. A soft hiss issues from the hearth.</p>

<p>When one or more characters approach within 10 feet of the fireplace, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A small, hissing dragon made of ash and smoke erupts from the fireplace, filling the room with soot as it beats its wings.</p>

<p>The smoky dragonet has the statistics of a smoke mephit but fights only in self-defense. If left alone, it flies out of the room at a speed of 30 feet, up the spiral staircase (<strong>area area Q17</strong>), through the curtain at <strong>area area Q30</strong>, over the rubble in <strong>area area Q33</strong>, and into <strong>area area Q36</strong>. Once there, it lands on the back of Vladimir&rsquo;s throne and disappears.</p>

Dragon&rsquo;s Audience Hall</h3><blockquote>
<p>The west wall of this fifty-foot-long, thirty-foot-wide audience hall has crumbled, leaving a gaping hole and a pile of rubble. Weapons and shields that once hung from the walls have fallen to the floor and succumbed to rust. A large, wooden throne carved to resemble a dragon with unfolding wings faces three tall windows to the west. Slumped in the throne is a gaunt, armored figure with one gauntlet wrapped around the hilt of a greatsword.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vladimir Horngaard (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>), commander of the fallen Order of the Silver Dragon, is slumped in the throne. If the beacon of Argynvostholt (see <strong>area area Q53</strong>) has been lit, the corpse is lifeless, and characters can plunder it freely (see &ldquo;<strong>area Treasure</strong>&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>If the beacon has not been lit, the body is serving as a host for the revenant. If the characters approach it, it says, &ldquo;Go away.&rdquo; If they don&rsquo;t leave immediately, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The creature&rsquo;s grip on the greatsword tightens. &ldquo;If you have come to destroy me, know this: I perished defending this land from evil over four centuries ago, and because of my failure, I am forever doomed. If you destroy this body, my spirit will find a new corpse to inhabit, and I will hunt you down. You cannot free me from my damnation, nor would I wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have come to free this land from the creature that feasts on the blood of the innocent, know this: There is no monster I hate more than Strahd von Zarovich. He slew Argynvost, broke the life of the knight I loved, and destroyed the valiant order to which I devoted my life, but Strahd has already died once. He can&rsquo;t be allowed to die again. Instead, he must suffer eternally in a hell of his own creation, from which he can never escape. Whatever can be done to bring him misery and unrest, I will do, but I will destroy anyone who tries to end his torment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vladimir fights in self-defense. He also rises from his throne and attacks if the characters fail to heed his warning and press him for help destroying Strahd. The first time Vladimir takes damage, six Phantom Warrior (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>) materialize and join the fray, coming to his defense.</p>
<p>Hatred so clouds Vladimir&rsquo;s mind that he can&rsquo;t remember that Sir Godfrey (<strong>area area Q37</strong>) was his beloved in life. If Sir Godfrey helps the characters and faces Vladimir, anguished recognition shines in Vladimir&rsquo;s eyes, yet only lighting the beacon can free him.</p>

Knights of the Order</h3><p>The leaders of the Order of the Silver Dragon used to convene here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the dust and cobwebs, you see faded war banners adorning the walls of a spacious chamber, in the center of which stands a heavy wooden table. An iron chandelier hangs above the table, which is surrounded by six high-backed chairs with wood-carved dragons perched atop them. Slumped in five of the chairs are skeletal humans in tattered chainmail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the beacon in area Q53 has been lit, the spirits of these revenants are laid to rest, leaving behind their inanimate corpses. If the beacon has not been lit, add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The corpses tilt their heads in your direction. One of them growls, &ldquo;Why do you the living disturb the dead?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The skeletal figures are five Revenant. All five are lawful evil. They are awaiting orders from Vladimir (<strong>area area Q36</strong>) and fight only in self-defense. The revenants wear broken chainmail that affords as much protection as leather armor, and they wield longswords. As an action, a revenant attacks twice with its longsword, wielding the weapon with both hands and dealing 15 (<wc-roll>2d10 + 4</wc-roll>) slashing damage on a hit.</p>
<p>One of the revenants, Sir Godfrey Gwilym, is a spellcaster with a challenge rating of 6 (2,300 XP) and the following additional feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> Sir Godfrey is a 16th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14). Sir Godfrey has the following paladin spells prepared:</p>
<p>1st level (4 slots): <wc-fetch type=spell>command</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>divine favor</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>thunderous smite</wc-fetch></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Characters who inspect the fireplace notice a shield-shaped patch on the wall above the mantelpiece. A magic shield once hung above the fireplace, but it was taken when Strahd&rsquo;s soldiers plundered the mansion. It now rests in Castle Ravenloft&rsquo;s treasury (chapter 4, <strong>area area K41</strong>).</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey can sense that the spirit of Argynvost isn&rsquo;t at rest and isn&rsquo;t happy that the order has been reduced to such a state. If the characters petition the revenants for aid, Sir Godfrey (speaking in a scratchy voice) relates all the information presented at the start of the chapter concerning Argynvost and the rise and fall of the Order of the Silver Dragon. Neither he nor the other revenants can help the characters in any meaningful way, however, because of the oaths they have sworn to Vladimir Horngaard.</p>

Fate has unlocked his memory of the love that he and Vladimir once shared, and the power of that memory drives Godfrey to help fight Strahd and restore the order&rsquo;s honor.</p>
<p>If the beacon in <strong>area area Q53</strong> has not been lit, Godfrey&rsquo;s decision incurs the wrath of the other revenants, triggering an armed conflict.</p>
<p>If the beacon in area Q53 has been lit, Sir Godfrey remains a revenant even after all the other revenants (including Vladimir) are laid to rest, except that his alignment changes to lawful good. Although Sir Godfrey is unaware of the tarokka card reading, he somehow senses that he must perform one final task before his spirit can rest with Vladimir&rsquo;s, and thus he agrees to help the characters face Strahd in Castle Ravenloft.</p>

<p>This room is a haven for dust and cobwebs. Three narrow windows allow slivers of light to illuminate bare oak shelves along the walls and a torn, padded chair lying on its side near a cavernous hearth. A picture above the mantel has been slashed, its lower half hanging down below the frame like a torn piece of flesh. An iron door set in the south corner of the west wall hangs open on one hinge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strahd&rsquo;s soldiers forced open the iron door that once sealed Argynvost&rsquo;s vault (<strong>area area Q41</strong>). They also took every book in this study but one. (Many of the books taken from here can be found in Strahd&rsquo;s study in Castle Ravenloft.)</p>
<p>The sole remaining volume lies on the floor behind the overturned chair. Titled <em>The Oath Celestial</em>, the book has been partially burned, and its cover was slashed by a sword. Leafing through the crumbling book reveals that it is a devotional text for knights from a place called the Holy Empire of Valentia. Most of the knights who joined Argynvost against Strahd came from that empireâ€”now lost beyond the mists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The picture shows the mansion in better days, under clear winter skies with snow-capped mountains in the background. The top of the chapel tower glows like a silver beacon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The picture radiates an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell, but the aura is weak. If the characters repair the picture using a <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch> cantrip, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The beacon in the picture flashes with a brilliant silver light, and the spectral form of a huge silver dragon fills the room. &ldquo;My skull lies in the fortress of my enemy,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;displayed in a place of ill omen. Return my skull to its rightful crypt, and my spirit will shine here forever, bringing hope to this dark land.&rdquo; With that, the dragon&rsquo;s apparition fades away.</p>

<p>The spectral dragon isn&rsquo;t the spirit of Argynvost, but a spell-like effect. Once the dragon has spoken, the picture no longer glows and becomes nonmagical.</p>

<p>Wooden stairs climb to the tower&rsquo;s peak, which has a stone floor and a thirty-foot-high pitched roof. Ravens roost on crisscrossing rafters, coming and going through small holes in the roof.

</blockquote>
<p>The Raven that roost here are harmless, but they watch the characters with great interest. If the characters look out the windows, you can use the following text to describe what they see in the distance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the north and east lies a mist-shrouded valley with dark woods, a small town, and a lonely windmill on a precipice. To the south, a river flows through a foggy marsh. To the west, between rocky hills, you glimpse an abbey perched on a snowy mountainside beyond a long stretch of fog-smothered pines.</p>

Although the mountains prevent the beacon&rsquo;s light from reaching Castle Ravenloft directly, Strahd can see the light&rsquo;s glow in the sky to the west.</p>
<p>The beacon can be seen in Vallaki (chapter 5), Krezk (chapter 8), and Berez (chapter 10), as well as from Old Bonegrinder (chapter 6), Van Richten&rsquo;s Tower (chapter 11), and the werewolf den (chapter 15).</p>

Those who have a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 11 or higher hear the clopping of horse hooves and the crunch of wagon wheels on gravel.</p>
<p>A cart pulled by a draft horse and driven by a mad Vistana named Kolya (CN male human bandit) stops in front of the mansion. After relieving himself on the statue of Argynvost (<strong>area area Q1</strong>), Kolya untethers the horse and rides back to the Vistani camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, <strong>area area N9</strong>), leaving the cart and its cargo: a plain wooden coffin.</p>
<p>The coffin was made in Vallaki by the local coffin maker, Henrik van der Voort (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N6</strong>).

She has heard that the reportedly haunted mansion might harbor enemies of Strahd and contain secrets to the vampire&rsquo;s destruction.</p>
<p>Once she arrives, Ezmerelda releases the horse (which flees back to its camp) and quietly makes her way through the mansion until she reaches the characters.</p>
<p>Hot on Ezmerelda&rsquo;s trail are the Vistani leader Arrigal (NE male human assassin) and two Vistani bodyguards (CE female Bandit). Arrigal rides a black riding horse, while the bandits ride two Dire Wolf. These dire wolves are servants of Strahd and can&rsquo;t be <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>Arrigal is determined to capture Ezmerelda and haul her back to the Vistani camp to face punishment for horse theft. He does nothing to antagonize the characters, however, and returns to the Vistani camp if he can&rsquo;t convince them to give up Ezmerelda.
