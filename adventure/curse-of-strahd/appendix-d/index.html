In addition, adventurers who explore this unholy realm encounter other things that go bump in the night, including creatures born out of Strahd&rsquo;s evil. The new monsters that appear in this adventure are described below, along with several of the vampire&rsquo;s allies and enemiesâ€”souls whose fates are entwined with those of the adventurers. Strahd himself appears here as well.</p>
<p>The monsters and NPCs are presented in alphabetical order.</p>

This nameless holy figure, whom others call the Abbot, was drawn to the abbey after Saint Markovia died by Strahd&rsquo;s hand. He sought to restore the abbey after it fell to corruption, but was himself corrupted.</p>
<h6 id=angel-in-disguise>
<a href=#angel-in-disguise class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Angel in Disguise</h6><p>The Abbot is a deva that has lived for millennia. He typically assumes the form of a strikingly handsome human priest in his late twenties or early thirties. More than a hundred years ago, the deva was sent from the Upper Planes to honor the legacy of Saint Markovia. He reopened the abbey and began tending to the physically and mentally ill. In so doing, he hoped to bring some much-needed light to Barovia. His efforts worked for a while, but then the Dark Powers began to corrupt him.</p>

The deva rid them of their diseases, an act for which they were eternally grateful, but could not cure them of certain human defects that had been present since birth. The Abbot became consumed with a prideful, obsessive desire to rid the poor Belviews of their lingering imperfections. The Belview family, however, had strange ideas of what it meant to be perfect. They didn&rsquo;t want to be ordinary humans. They wanted the eyes of a cat, wings to fly like a bat, the strength of a mule, and the guile of a snake. In short, they craved bestial traits, and the Abbot, taking pity on them, yielded to their mad desires.</p>

One day, a Barovian lord named Vasili von Holtz visited the abbey. The Abbot knew at once that the man was evil, but von Holtz stressed that he only wanted to help. He furnished the Abbot with forbidden lore plucked from the Amber Temple (chapter 13), then helped the Abbot transform the Belviews into mongrelfolkâ€”maniacal humans with bestial deformities and traits. The Belviews were happy, albeit insane. Only then did von Holtz reveal himself to be Strahd von Zarovich. Somehow the deva realized that any attempt to slay Strahd would be futileâ€”that the ancient curse upon the land meant that the vampire could never truly die, at least not in Barovia.</p>

His performance garnered the deva&rsquo;s sympathy, and the Abbot, playing into Strahd&rsquo;s hands, set for himself the goal of finding a cure for Strahd&rsquo;s &ldquo;malady.&rdquo; The Abbot is now convinced that the cure lies in reuniting Strahd with his lost love and, in so doing, ending Barovia&rsquo;s curse. The Abbot has recently completed work on a flesh golem bride made from the body parts of dead women. While the Belviews languish in the abbey&rsquo;s madhouse, the Abbot is giving his creation lessons in etiquette and ladylike conduct so that &ldquo;she&rdquo; can be formally presented to Strahd and win his love.</p>
<p>Strahd has no interest in a flesh golem bride, but he enjoys corrupting this once angelic being and driving the Abbot to commit further acts of depravity.</p>

It was only after she embedded a magic gemstone in the hut that the whole thing was imbued with a semblance of life. When she wills it to do so, the hut pulls its gigantic roots free of the earth and shambles around like a spidery behemoth, shaking the ground with every step. The hut attacks with its flailing and stomping roots. It can also use its roots to fling large rocks.</p>

The gem was one of three imbued with life-giving magic that made the grapevines in the vineyard healthier, guaranteeing the finest wines. Baba Lysaga stole one of the gems and perverted its magic, using it instead to animate her wooden hut.</p>
<p>Removing the gem from the hut renders the hut <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>. That task is easier said than done, however. The glowing green gem is contained in a cavity in the stump, beneath the rotted floorboards of the hut. The floorboards can be ripped up with a successful DC 14 Strength check or smashed by dealing 10 damage to them. Once the floorboards are out of the way, a creature can reach into the cavity and snatch the gem. But if someone attempts this while the hut is alive, the cavity sprouts wooden teeth, becoming a mouth that bites anything that tries to remove the gem; a creature trying to remove the gem must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature claims the stone without getting bitten. On a failed save, the creature is bitten for 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) piercing damage and fails to obtain the gem.</p>

<p>Baba Lysaga&rsquo;s unhealthy attachment to the baby Strahd did not go unnoticed. After she received several disturbing reports, Queen Ravenovia was forced to banish the midwife from the kingdom. Lysaga never saw Strahd again, but she has succeeded in staying alive to witness the triumphs of her beloved boy, who, in her mind, is eternally blessed. Despite the horrors Strahd has wrought, Lysaga still envisions him as the perfect child she delivered into the world. Strahd is the only thing in her life that matters to her.</p>

<p>In the filth-ridden depths of her heart, Lysaga knows that Strahd would never accept her as his true mother, nor could she bear his rejection. As a result, she has never confronted him.

<p>Strahd doesn&rsquo;t consider the wereravens a serious threat, but Lysaga has chosen to make them the bane of her existence. After much searching and scrying, she discovered a wereraven refuge at the Wizard of Wines winery (chapter 12), and she has begun to wage war against it. In addition, she has forged an alliance with the mad druids that haunt Yester Hill (chapter 14), convincing them that she gave birth to Strahd, whom the druids consider a god.

They prefer to live in the shadows and can see in the dark. When traveling in the open, they use <wc-fetch type=spell>alter self</wc-fetch> spells to assume less conspicuous forms. They also use these spells to grow long, sharp claws with which they can attack.</p>

<p>Barovian witches use the <wc-fetch type=spell>find familiar</wc-fetch> spell to call forth familiars. They are particularly fond of cats, though snakes and toads are also common. These animals lurk amid the clutter of the witches' lairs, seldom wandering far from their vile masters.</p>

Even today, years later, she can still hear Erasmus&rsquo;s pleas for mercy. That event haunted her childhood.</p>
<p>Van Richten tracked down Ezmerelda&rsquo;s family soon after the kidnapping, but not before the Vistani had sold the boy. Though van Richten could have done them harm, he instead interrogated Ezmerelda&rsquo;s mother and father on the whereabouts of his missing son. Satisfied with their answers, he spared their lives before departing with the information they had given him. Ezmerelda witnessed van Richten&rsquo;s act of mercy and was deeply moved by it.</p>

After many harrowing adventures, she tracked down van Richten two years later. Thinking she was a Vistana assassin, he put a sword to her throat and threatened to spill her blood. Ezmerelda convinced him that she genuinely wanted to help him find his missing son, whereupon van Richten told her the saddest of tales. He had found his son, who had been transformed into a vampire spawn. When Erasmus pleaded to his father for salvation, van Richten granted his request by ending his existence.</p>

But because van Richten could never bring himself to fully trust a Vistana, he kept secrets from her. The two vampire hunters got on each other&rsquo;s nerves, and their arguments became more frequent.

On one of her less successful adventures, a werewolf bit off her right leg below the knee, and although she avoided being afflicted with lycanthropy, Ezmerelda was sidelined for months. She commissioned a master artisan to craft a prosthetic lower leg and foot. After several tries, he delivered a prosthesis that restored her mobility.

She decided that he might need help and traveled for months to reach Strahd&rsquo;s domain. She rode her wagon to Vallaki and learned about an old tower that seemed the sort of place van Richten would use as a base. When she arrived there, she found some of van Richten&rsquo;s belongings, but of the vampire hunter there was no sign. Although she is anxious to learn the whereabouts of her mentor, she is also eager to earn his trust and respect. To that end, she has been poring over van Richten&rsquo;s research and learning about Strahd and Castle Ravenloft, with every intention of dispatching the vampire herself.</p>

He became a sociopath. Other children ruthlessly mocked him because of his dead family and his missing arm, but he was a large boy and had no trouble killing them and disposing of their bodies. He was eventually caught in the act and brought to the burgomaster. Instead of punishing the boy for his crimes, Baron Vallakovich pardoned Izek and took him into his home. Izek has been loyal to the burgomaster ever since, enjoying the power of his position and the comforts of his master&rsquo;s mansion. When he isn&rsquo;t enforcing the burgomaster&rsquo;s will, Izek drinks copious amounts of wine.</p>

If he spots her, he tries to take her by force to the burgomaster&rsquo;s mansion. If he succeeds, he holds her captive in his bedroom (chapter 5, <strong>area area N3j</strong>). Unknown to Izek and Ireena, they are brother and sister. Ireena fled after Izek was attacked by the dire wolf and became lost in the woods. She wandered for days in shock until she was found and adopted by Kolyan Indirovich in the village of Barovia. Izek covets her in an unwholesome way and won&rsquo;t allow anyone or anything to come between them.</p>

Although Velikov passed away more than a century ago, Kasimir continues to live among Velikov&rsquo;s descendants. Unfortunately, in his view, these modern Vistani are neither as noble nor as enlightened as their forebears.

Convinced that she was the concubine of the devil Strahd, Kasimir and his fellow dusk elves stoned Patrina to death. As punishment for depriving him of his bride, Strahd butchered all the women in the dusk elf tribe, and Kasimir&rsquo;s ears were cut off to punish him for instigating the stoning. He wears a cowl to conceal his mutilation.</p>
<p>Kasimir&rsquo;s feeling of loss is tinged with simmering rage. Patrina now speaks to her brother in dreams, telling him how years of guilt and regret have dispelled all evil thoughts from her mind and cleansed her tortured soul. But Kasimir remains unconvinced by her assertions, because he knows that Strahd has corrupted Patrina and led her down a path of evil and deceit. For that reason, Kasimir wants to see the vampire destroyed so that his sister can be rescued from her eternal damnation.</p>

Kasimir has been spying on the temple for years, but he needs adventurers to help him survive its perils. He thinks that the secret to breaking Strahd&rsquo;s pact and freeing Barovia from its curse might be hidden there, but more important, he believes that the Amber Temple holds the secret to bringing the ancient dead back to life.</p>
<p>With the characters' help, Kasimir thinks he might be able to find out how to restore Patrina to flesh and blood, whereupon he can travel to Castle Ravenloft and end his sister&rsquo;s torment. Kasimir has no inkling that Patrina is using him for exactly that purpose, and that her ultimate goal is to become as powerful a vampire as Strahd.</p>

She came to know the castle like the back of her hand, and she was present for the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana. After Strahd went mad and murdered his brother, she fled the castle and took refuge with the Vistani. Later, she forged a pact with the goddess Mother Night, trading her youth for the power to undo the evil that Strahd had wrought. Mother Night transformed Katarina into an ageless crone gifted with the power of magical foresight. In the guise of Madam Eva, she uses this ability to help Strahd. She can send her Vistani out in their wagons to visit other worlds and bring adventurers to Strahd&rsquo;s domain, in hopes that they will find a way to destroy the vampire or set Strahd free.</p>

Their humanoid bodies incorporate the features of various beasts. For example, one mongrelfolk might have the basic body shape of a dwarf with a head that combines the features of a cat and a lizard, one arm that ends in a crab&rsquo;s pincer, and one leg that ends in a cloven hoof. Another might have the skin and horns of a cow, the eyes of a spider, frog&rsquo;s legs, and a scaly lizard&rsquo;s tail. Each mongrelfolk&rsquo;s mad combination of humanoid and animal forms results in its having a slow, awkward gait.</p>

They are fond of camouflage, attaching leaves and twigs to their cloaks, making brown paint to cover their skin, and weaving grass nets under which they can hide. They use such camouflage while hunting in the wild or while standing guard outside their lairs.

<p>Mongrelfolk can breed with other humanoids, but nearly all children born to such parents are mongrelfolk. (About one child in every hundred is born looking like its non-mongrelfolk parent.)</p>

It can choose to end its undead existence at any time. Its spirit lingers willingly, either out of loyalty to its former master or because it believes it must perform a task to satisfy its honor or sense of duty. For example, a guard who dies defending a wall might return as a phantom warrior and continue guarding the wall, then disappear forever once a new guard assumes its post or the wall is destroyed. The period between the time it died and the time it rises as a phantom warrior is usually 24 hours.</p>

Her visits to the castle were nonetheless frequent, and she never traveled without her fool, the delightful Pidlwick. The little man was like a ray of sunshine in Castle Ravenloft, and though he failed to amuse Strahd, he delighted Tatyana and Sergei with his jokes and gambols. As a result, Strahd didn&rsquo;t object whenever Pidlwick and the duchess came to visit.</p>
<p>Eager to please and desiring to return the courtesy, the duchess commissioned the legendary toymaker Fritz von Weerg to build a clockwork effigy of Pidlwick as a gift for Strahd&rsquo;s family. Although the duchess&rsquo;s heart was in the right place, the effigy didn&rsquo;t have Pidlwick&rsquo;s abilities, and it failed to entertain anyone. Even though Pidlwick himself had spent months training it, the effigy couldn&rsquo;t speak, and its movements were more awkward than amusing.</p>
<p>A harsh winter trapped the duchess, her fool, and her fool&rsquo;s effigy in Castle Ravenloft for several months. The duchess subsequently succumbed to illness, after which Tatyana asked Pidlwick to remain at Castle Ravenloft.</p>

In the days that followed, Pidlwick II tried its best to fill its namesake&rsquo;s shoes, but the effigy&rsquo;s mere presence was upsetting to Tatyana, and it was never called on to perform.

On rare occasions when someone stayed there, Pidlwick would sneak out of the closet in the middle of the night, smother the guest with a pillow, and then retreat back to the closet. The castle staff never considered that the effigy might be responsible, instead assuming that the guests had died in their sleep.</p>
<p>But Strahd was not fooled. He came to realize fairly quickly that the clockwork effigy had begun to display a murderous nature. Rather than have Pidlwick II destroyed, Strahd kept the fool around to dispose of irksome guests from time to time.</p>
<p>After the deaths of Sergei and Tatyana, the castle became virtually abandoned, and there were no more guests for Pidlwick II to &ldquo;entertain.&rdquo; The clockwork effigy emerged from its closet and found new places to hide. It fears Strahd and eagerly follows anyone who gives it the attention it craves.</p>
<p>Pidlwick II is basically an oversized toyâ€”a 4-foot-tall mechanism stuffed with gears, springs, and other components expertly fitted together to impart a semblance of life to it. Its skin is made of stitched leather pulled taut over an articulated wooden frame. Pidlwick II has rubbed soot around its eyes and mouth, giving it the triangular eyes and jagged grin of a jack-o'-lantern.</p>

When the dusk elves later declined to pay fealty to King Barov, Rahadin helped Barov conquer them. The elf kingdom&rsquo;s royal line was obliterated, the dusk elves hunted like rabbits. The few that survived were either subjugated or forced to live among the Vistani. So pleased was Barov with Rahadin that the king made the dusk elf an honorary member of his family.</p>

When the wars ended and Strahd turned his attention to building Castle Ravenloft, Rahadin saw to it that wizards and artisans were brought to Barovia. Years later, Strahd appointed Rahadin his castle chamberlain. Rahadin was pleased to do whatever Strahd asked of him, and he instilled terror in the castle staff by routinely flogging those who didn&rsquo;t perform their duties to his exacting standards.</p>
<p>When a dusk elf named Patrina Velikovna came knocking on Strahd&rsquo;s door, Rahadin could see that she intrigued Strahd, but Rahadin was suspicious of her motives. Patrina tried to seduce Strahd with the prospect of immortalityâ€”something Strahd desired above all. She told him of a vault of forbidden lore called the Amber Temple, where the secret of gaining immortality was hidden. While Strahd was off exploring the temple, Rahadin handled all of his master&rsquo;s affairs and began searching for a woman who could tear Strahd away from Patrina Velikovna. In this task, he failed. His goal was fulfilled, however, when Sergei, Strahd&rsquo;s brother, found Tatyana.</p>
<p>Tatyana was Strahd&rsquo;s typeâ€”a woman of exquisite beauty and gentle manner. When Strahd returned to Ravenloft, the young woman instantly caught his eye, and Rahadin had the pleasure of informing Patrina that her presence at the castle was no longer desired.</p>
<p>Rahadin&rsquo;s loyalty didn&rsquo;t waver after Tatyana died and Strahd became a vampire. Rahadin continued to do his master&rsquo;s bidding. Eager to put Tatyana out of his mind, Strahd lured more women to the castle, taking several of them as brides before draining their lives and turning them into vampire spawn. Rahadin would see to it that these women were lavished with jewels and fine clothes, and made comfortable during their stay in Ravenloft.</p>

The ageless Patrina returned to Ravenloft in the hope of winning Strahd&rsquo;s love. This time, it was clear that Patrina craved Strahd&rsquo;s power and that Strahd would never love her. Rahadin assumed that Patrina would suffer the same fate as those women who had come before her. He was proven wrong when Patrina&rsquo;s own people stoned her to death to keep Strahd from claiming her as his wife.</p>
<p>Strahd was upset that the dusk elves had taken Patrina from him. After securing her body and entombing it in the catacombs of Ravenloft, Strahd sent Rahadin to punish the dusk elves. Rahadin slew the female elves so that the males couldn&rsquo;t breed. He also sliced off the ears of Patrina&rsquo;s brother, Kasimir, who had orchestrated the stoning.</p>

Van Richten&rsquo;s tale is a sad one. A scholar and doctor from a land called Darkon, he married his childhood sweetheart, Ingrid, and together they had a son, Erasmus. When he was fourteen, Erasmus was stolen away by Vistani and sold to a vampire named Baron Metus to be used as a companion. By the time van Richten found his son, it was too late: the baron had already transformed Erasmus into a vampire spawn. Erasmus begged his father to end his suffering, which van Richten did by pounding a wooden stake through his son&rsquo;s chest. Baron Metus avenged that deed by killing van Richten&rsquo;s wife, and van Richten has lived with the horror of his family&rsquo;s destruction ever since. After destroying Baron Metus in turn, van Richten sought revenge against the Vistani and took up a life of hunting evil monsters.</p>

He knows his road is coming to an end, but his work isn&rsquo;t done. He has come to Barovia to kill Strahd von Zarovich, the greatest vampire of them all. Van Richten has studied Strahd for years and knows he can&rsquo;t hope to best the vampire in a straight-up confrontation: he must wait for the right moment to strike. He has good evidence to suggest that Strahd periodically hibernates in his coffin, sometimes for years, when all is quiet in the realm. While he bides his time, van Richten hides in plain sight with the aid of a <wc-fetch type=item>hat of disguise</wc-fetch>, his thoughts protected by a <wc-fetch type=item>ring of mind shielding</wc-fetch>. He is trying to learn more about the Keepers of the Featherâ€”a society of wereravens that oppose Strahdâ€”while trying not to expose the secret society to their mutual enemy. He thinks the wereravens might prove helpful when the time comes. Van Richten also wants to take out as many of Strahd&rsquo;s spies as he can, starting with evil Vistani.</p>

He taught her many of his monster-hunting techniques, but she doesn&rsquo;t know all of his tricks and disguises. So far, their paths haven&rsquo;t crossed. In the event that van Richten becomes aware of Ezmerelda&rsquo;s presence, he does his utmost to protect her without putting his own plans in jeopardy. If he can manipulate a party of adventurers into keeping an eye on her, he will do so.</p>
<p>Van Richten works alone. A curse placed on him long ago by a Vistani seer brings doom to those he befriends. Furthermore, he believes too much is at stake to risk exposure. Consequently, if he thinks he&rsquo;s in danger of being unmasked, he retreats to his tower (see chapter 11) or some other quiet corner of Strahd&rsquo;s domain.</p>

<p>When you run an encounter with Strahd, keep the following facts in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strahd attacks at the most advantageous moment and from the most advantageous position.</li>
<li>Strahd knows when he&rsquo;s in over his head. If he begins taking more damage than he can regenerate, he moves beyond the reach of melee combatants and spellcasters, or he flies away (using summoned Wolf or Swarm of Bats or Swarm of Rats to guard his retreat).</li>
<li>Strahd observes the characters to see who among them are most easily swayed, then tries to charm characters who have low Wisdom scores and use them as thralls. At the very least, he can order a <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> character to guard him against other members of the adventuring party.</li>

<p>Any damage that Strahd takes is transferred to the Heart of Sorrow (see chapter 4, <strong>area area K20</strong>). If the heart absorbs damage that reduces it to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and Strahd takes any leftover damage. The Heart of Sorrow has 50 hit points and is restored to that number of hit points each dawn, provided it has at least 1 hit point remaining. Strahd can, as a bonus action on his turn, break his link to the Heart of Sorrow so that it no longer absorbs damage dealt to him. Strahd can reestablish his link to the Heart of Sorrow as a bonus action on his turn, but only while in Castle Ravenloft.</p>
<p>The effect of the protection afforded by the Heart of Sorrow can be chilling to behold, as damage to Strahd is quickly undone. For example, a critical hit might dislocate Strahd&rsquo;s jaw, but only for a moment; then the vampire&rsquo;s jaw quickly resets itself.</p>
<p>The ability of the Heart of Sorrow to absorb damage is suppressed if it or Strahd is fully within an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch>.</p>

<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Strahd can take one of the following lair action options, or forgo using any of them in that round:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until initiative count 20 of the next round, Strahd can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if they weren&rsquo;t there.</li>
<li>Strahd targets any number of doors and windows that he can see, causing each one to either open or close as he wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (needing a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until Strahd chooses to end the effect, or until Strahd uses this lair action again.</li>
<li>Strahd summons the angry spirit of one who has died in the castle. The apparition appears next to a hostile creature that Strahd can see, makes an attack against that creature, and then disappears. The apparition has the statistics of a specter.</li>
<li>Strahd targets one Medium or smaller creature that casts a shadow. The target&rsquo;s shadow must be visible to Strahd and within 30 feet of him. If the target fails a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, its shadow detaches from it and becomes a shadow that obeys Strahd&rsquo;s commands, acting on initiative count 20. A <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell or a <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> spell cast on the target restores its natural shadow, but only if its undead shadow has been destroyed.</li>

So great was his hatred of Strahd and his thirst for vengeance that those feelings fueled the spirits of many of his fellow knightsâ€”including Godfreyâ€”to come back as revenants as well. Vladimir continued to wage the hopeless war, even as Strahd tightened his grip on the valley.</p>
<p>When Strahd became a vampire, Vladimir and his revenants should have gone to their eternal rest. But Strahd&rsquo;s deeds were so heinous that Barovia and the knight&rsquo;s spirits became trapped behind curtains of mist.</p>

Vladimir wants Strahd to suffer forever for the deaths of Godfrey and Argynvost, the destruction of their order, and all the other crimes of which the vampire is guilty. Vladimir believes that all of Barovia has been swept into hell, and he wants to make sure that Strahd stays trapped in it forever. It angers Vladimir that he and his fellow knights are also trapped, but in Vladimir&rsquo;s mind, such is the price of keeping the vampire confined. Even his love for Godfrey is now just a dim memory shrouded by his hate.</p>
<p>Were Vladimir to let go of his hatred, his spirit would find peace and could remember the warmth of love. Were Strahd to be defeated, even temporarily, the mists surrounding Barovia would fade, allowing the spirits of Vladimir and his knights to enter the afterlife. Nevertheless, Vladimir would rather savor Strahd&rsquo;s torment than bring peace to his fallen order or peace to the land of Barovia. Gone are the days of honor and valor.</p>

Although skilled at blending into society, they keep mostly to themselves, respect local laws, and strive to do good whenever possible.</p>
<p>In their human and hybrid forms, wereravens favor light weapons. They are reluctant to make bite attacks in raven form for fear of spreading their curse to those who don&rsquo;t deserve it or who would abuse it.</p>

The following text applies to wereraven characters specifically.</p>
<p>A character cursed with wereraven lycanthropy gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn&rsquo;t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the wereraven&rsquo;s bite are based on whichever is higher of the character&rsquo;s Strength and Dexterity. The bite of a wereraven in raven form deals 1 piercing damage (no ability modifier applies to this damage) and carries the curse of lycanthropy; see the &ldquo;Player Characters as Lycanthropes&rdquo; sidebar in the lycanthropes entry in the Monster Manual for details.</p>
