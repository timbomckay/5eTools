<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>You can run <em>Curse of Strahd</em> for 1st-level characters with the help of this optional mini-adventure, which is designed to advance characters to 3rd level. Players creating 1st-level characters can use the haunted one character background in appendix A, or they can pick backgrounds from the Player&rsquo;s Handbook as normal.</p>
<p>Before the characters can explore the haunted townhouse known as Death House, you need to guide them to the village of Barovia. The &ldquo;<strong>area Creeping Fog</strong>&rdquo; adventure hook in chapter 1 works best, as it introduces few distractions. Once the characters arrive in Strahd&rsquo;s domain, steer them to the village. For the duration of this introductory adventure, any attempt by the characters to explore other locations in Strahd&rsquo;s domain causes the mists of Ravenloft to block their path.</p>

The house has been burned to the ground many times, only to rise from the ashes time and againâ€”by its own will or that of Strahd. Locals give the building a wide berth for fear of antagonizing the evil spirits believed to haunt it.</p>
<p>The wealthy family that built the house practiced the dark arts. Through seduction and indoctrination, they expanded their cult to include a small yet nefarious circle of friends. When word got out, the rest of the village turned a blind eye to the house and the nightly debaucheries happening within it.</p>
<p>The cult tried to summon malevolent extraplanar entities with no success. The cultists also preyed on visitors, sacrificed them in bizarre rituals, and hosted morbid banquets to feast on their corpses. When nothing came of these ritualized murders, the cultists' activities became thinly disguised excuses to indulge their lurid fantasies. The ranks of the cult thinned as members began to lose interest in the debacle.</p>
<p>Then Strahd von Zarovich arrived.</p>
<p>The cultists regarded Strahd as a messiah sent to them by the Dark Powers. Drawn to Strahd like moths to a flame, they pledged their devotion for a promise of immortality, but Strahd turned them away, deeming the cult and its leaders unworthy of his attention. The cultists withdrew to Death House in despair.</p>
<p>The cult&rsquo;s habit of trapping and devouring wayward visitors proved to be its downfall. On one occasion, the cult snared a band of adventurers whom Strahd had lured to his domain to be his playthings. A black carriage arrived at Death House soon thereafter, and from out of its black heart stepped the vampire himself. The cultists tried to impress Strahd. In response, he slaughtered them for slaying his playthings. Centuries later, the cultists' spirits haunt the dungeons under the house. The building itself, it seems, is unwilling to let the cult be forgotten.</p>

Forced to follow a lonely road (<strong>area area A</strong>), they eventually arrive at the village of Barovia (<strong>area area E</strong>). Once they reach the village, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gravel road leads to a village, its tall houses dark as tombstones. Nestled among these solemn dwellings are a handful of closed-up shops. Even the tavern is shut tight.</p>
<p>A soft whimpering draws your eye toward a pair of children standing in the middle of an otherwise lifeless street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The children are ten-year-old Rosavalda (&ldquo;Rose&rdquo;) and her seven-year-old brother, Thornboldt (&ldquo;Thorn&rdquo;). Thorn is weeping and clutching a stuffed doll. Rose is trying to hush the boy.</p>
<p>If the characters approach the children or call out to them, add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After shushing the boy, the girl turns to you and says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a monster in our house!&rdquo; She then points to a tall brick row house that has seen better days. Its windows are dark. It has a gated portico on the ground floor, and the rusty gate is slightly ajar. The houses on either side are abandoned, their windows and doors boarded up.</p>
</blockquote>

</span></p>
<p>Characters who question the children learn the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The children don&rsquo;t know what the &ldquo;monster&rdquo; looks like, but they&rsquo;ve heard its terrible howls.</li>
<li>Their parents (Gustav and Elisabeth Durst) keep the monster trapped in the basement.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a baby (Walter) in the third-floor nursery. (Untrue, but the children believe it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rose and Thorn say that they won&rsquo;t go back in the house until they know the monster is gone. They can be convinced to wait in the portico (<strong>area area 1A</strong>) while the characters search the house. Although they appear to be flesh-and-blood children, Rose and Thorn are actually illusions created by the house to lure the characters inside. The children don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re illusions but vanish if attacked or forced into the house.</p>
<p>The children died of starvation centuries ago after their insane parents locked them in the attic and forgot about them. They were too young and innocent to understand that their parents were guilty of heinous crimes. Their parents told them stories about a monster in the basement to keep the children from going down to the dungeon level. The &ldquo;terrible howls&rdquo; they heard were actually the screams of the cult&rsquo;s victims.</p>

As more buildings disappear into the mists, the characters are left with little choice but to seek refuge in the house. The mists stop short of entering the house but engulf anyone outside (see chapter 2, &ldquo;<strong>area The Lands of Barovia</strong>,&rdquo; for information on the mists' effect).</p>

Its goal is to continue the work of the cult by luring visitors to their doom. Various important features of the house are summarized here.</p>
<p>The house has four stories (including the attic), with two balconies on the third floorâ€”one facing the front of the house, the other facing the back. The house has wooden floors throughout, and all windows have hinges that allow them to swing outward.</p>
<p>The rooms on the first and second floors are free of dust and signs of age. The floorboards and wall panels are well oiled, the drapes and wallpaper haven&rsquo;t faded, and the furniture looks new. No effort has been made to preserve the contents of the third floor or the attic. These areas are dusty and drafty, everything within them is old and draped in cobwebs, and the floorboards groan underfoot.</p>
<p>Ceilings vary in height by floor. The first floor has 10-foot-high ceilings, the second floor has 12-foot-high ceilings, the third floor has 8-foot-high ceilings, and the attic has 13-foot-high ceilings.</p>
<p>None of the rooms in the house are lit when the characters arrive, although most areas contain working oil lamps or fireplaces.</p>
<p>Characters can burn the house to the ground if they want, but any destruction to the house is temporary. After <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> days, the house begins to repair itself. Ashes sweep together to form blackened timbers, which then turn back into a sturdy wooden frame around which walls begin to materialize. Destroyed furnishings are likewise repaired. It takes <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> hours for the house to complete its resurrection. Items taken from the house aren&rsquo;t replaced, nor are undead that are destroyed. The dungeon level isn&rsquo;t considered part of the house and can&rsquo;t repair itself in this fashion.</p>

Entrance</h3><p>A wrought-iron gate with hinges on one side and a lock on the other fills the archway of a stone portico (area 1A). The gate is unlocked, and its rusty hinges shriek when the gate is opened. Oil lamps hang from the portico ceiling by chains, flanking a set of oaken doors that open into a grand foyer (area 1B).</p>
<p>Hanging on the south wall of the foyer is a shield emblazoned with a coat-of-arms (a stylized golden windmill on a red field), flanked by framed portraits of stony-faced aristocrats (long-dead members of the Durst family). Mahogany-framed double doors leading from the foyer to the main hall (area 2A) are set with panes of stained glass.</p>

Main Hall</h3><p>A wide hall (area 2A) runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a <wc-fetch type=item>longsword</wc-fetch> (nonmagical) with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt. The wood-paneled walls are ornately sculpted with images of vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check, see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs. The decorative paneling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second floor.</p>
<p>A cloakroom (area 2B) has several black cloaks hanging from hooks on the walls. A top hat sits on a high shelf.</p>

Den of Wolves</h3><p>This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter&rsquo;s den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag&rsquo;s head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are three stuffed wolves.</p>
<p>Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face the hearth, with an oak table between them supporting a cask of wine, two carved wooden goblets, a pipe rack, and a candelabrum. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs.</p>
<p>Two cabinets stand against the walls. The east cabinet sports a lock that can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. It holds a <wc-fetch type=item>heavy crossbow</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type=item>light crossbow</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type=item>hand crossbow</wc-fetch>, and 20 <wc-fetch type=item>Crossbow Bolts (20)</wc-fetch> for each weapon.

Kitchen and Pantry</h3><p>The kitchen (area 4A) is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a well-stocked pantry (area 4B). All the food in the pantry appears fresh but tastes bland.</p>

Dining Room</h3><p>The centerpiece of this wood-paneled dining room is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.</p>
<p>The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check, see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking amid the carved foliage.</p>
<p>Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry depicting hunting dogs and horse-mounted aristocrats chasing after a wolf hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.</p>
<p>The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.</p>

<p>Standing suits of armor flank wooden doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf&rsquo;s head.

Library</h3><p>The master of the house used to spend many hours here before his descent into madness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The desk has several items resting atop it: an oil lamp, a jar of ink, a quill pen, a tinderbox, and a letter kit containing a red wax candle, four blank sheets of parchment, and a wooden seal bearing the Durst family&rsquo;s insignia (a windmill). The desk drawer is empty except for an iron key, which unlocks the door to <strong>area area 20</strong>.</p>
<p>The bookshelves hold hundreds of tomes covering a range of topics including history, warfare, and alchemy. There are also several shelves containing first-edition collected works of poetry and fiction. The books rot and fall apart if taken from the house.</p>

Secret Room</h3><p>This secret room contains bookshelves packed with tomes describing fiend-summoning rituals and the necromantic rituals of a cult called the Priests of Osybus. The rituals are bogus, which any character can ascertain after studying the books for 1 hour and succeeding on a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest is a skeleton in leather armor. Close inspection reveals that the skeleton belongs to a human who triggered a poisoned dart trap. Three darts are stuck in the dead adventurer&rsquo;s armor and ribcage. The dart-firing mechanism inside the chest no longer functions.</p>
<p>Clutched in the skeleton&rsquo;s left hand is a letter bearing the seal of Strahd von Zarovich, which the adventurer tried to remove from the chest. Written in flowing script, the letter reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My most pathetic servant,</p>
<p>I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.</p>
<p>You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a stillborn son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.</p>
<p>Your dread lord and master,</p>
<p>Strahd von Zarovich</p>

Nursemaid&rsquo;s Suite</h3><p>Dust and cobwebs shroud an elegantly appointed bedroom (area 15A) and an adjoining nursery (area 15B). Double doors set with panes of stained glass pull open to reveal a balcony (area 15C) overlooking the front of the house.</p>
<p>The bedroom once belonged to the family&rsquo;s nursemaid. The master of the house and the nursemaid had an affair, which led to the birth of a stillborn baby named Walter. The cult slew the nursemaid shortly thereafter. Unless the characters already defeated it in <strong>area area 18</strong>, the nursemaid&rsquo;s spirit haunts the bedroom as a specter. The specter manifests and attacks when a character opens the door to the nursery. The specter resembles a terrified, skeletally thin young woman; it can&rsquo;t speak or be reasoned with.</p>
<p>The bedroom contains a large bed, two end tables, and an empty wardrobe. Mounted on the wall next to the wardrobe is a full-length mirror with an ornate wooden frame carved to look like ivy and berries. Characters who search the wall for secret doors or otherwise inspect the mirror can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check, notice eyeballs among the berries. The wall behind the mirror has a secret door in it (see &ldquo;Secret Door&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The nursery contains a crib covered with a hanging black shroud. When characters part the shroud, they see a tightly wrapped, baby-sized bundle lying in the crib. Characters who unwrap the blanket find nothing inside it.</p>

Children&rsquo;s Room</h3><p>The door to this room is locked from the outside (see <strong>area area 16</strong> for details).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds sized for children. Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that&rsquo;s a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing. The smaller of the two cradles a stuffed doll that you also recognize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Durst children, Rosavalda &ldquo;Rose&rdquo; Durst and Thornboldt &ldquo;Thorn&rdquo; Durst, were neglected by their parents and locked in this room until they starved to death. Their small skeletons lie in the middle of the floor, plain as day, wearing tattered clothing that the characters recognize as belonging to the children. Thorn&rsquo;s skeleton cradles the boy&rsquo;s stuffed doll.</p>
<p>The toy chest contains an assortment of stuffed animals and toys. Characters who search the dollhouse and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check find all of the house&rsquo;s secret doors, including one in the attic that leads to a spiral staircase (a miniature replica of <strong>area area 21</strong>).</p>

Use the ghost statistics in the Monster Manual, with the following modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ghosts are Small and lawful good.</li>
<li>They have 35 (<wc-roll>10d6</wc-roll>) hit points each.</li>
<li>They lack the Horrifying Visage action.</li>
<li>They speak Common and have a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP).</li>
</ul>
<p>The children don&rsquo;t like it when the characters disturb their toys, but they fight only in self-defense. Unlike the illusions outside the house, these children know that they&rsquo;re dead. If asked how they died, Rose and Thorn explain that their parents locked them in the attic to protect them from &ldquo;the monster in the basement,&rdquo; and that they died from hunger. If asked how one gets to the basement, Rose points to the dollhouse and says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a secret door in the attic.&rdquo; Characters who then search the dollhouse for secret doors gain advantage on their Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks to find them.</p>
<p>The children fear abandonment. If one or more characters try to leave, the ghost-children attempt to possess them. If one of the ghosts possesses a character, allow the player to retain control of the character, but assign the character one of the following flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>A character possessed by Rose gains the following flaw: &ldquo;I like being in charge and get angry when other people tell me what to do.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A character possessed by Thorn gains the following flaw: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared of everything, including my own shadow, and weep with despair when things don&rsquo;t go my way.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>A character possessed by the ghost of Rose or Thorn won&rsquo;t willingly leave Death House or the dungeon below it. Both ghosts can be intimidated into leaving their hosts with a successful DC 11 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check made as an action.</p>
<p>A ghost reduced to 0 hit points can reform at dawn the next day. The only way to put the children&rsquo;s spirits to rest is to put their skeletal remains in their tombs (<strong>area areas 23E</strong> and <strong>area 23F</strong>). The children don&rsquo;t know this, however.</p>

Secret Stairs</h3><p>A narrow spiral staircase made of creaky wood is contained within a 5-foot-wide shaft of mortared stone that starts in the attic and descends 50 feet to the dungeon level, passing through the lower levels of the house as it makes its descent. Thick cobwebs fill the shaft and reduce visibility in the staircase to 5 feet.</p>
<p>The secret door and shaft don&rsquo;t exist until the house reveals them, which can happen in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters find Strahd&rsquo;s letter in the secret room behind the library (<strong>area area 9</strong>).</li>
<li>The characters find the replica secret door in the attic of the dollhouse (<strong>area area 20</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the house wills the secret door into existence, characters find it automatically if they search the wall (no ability check required). Characters who descend the spiral staircase end up in area 22.</p>

Darklord&rsquo;s Shrine</h3><blockquote>
<p>This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls. A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands next to him. In his right hand, he holds a smoky-gray crystal orb.</p>
<p>The room has exits in the west and north walls. Chanting can be heard coming from the west.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statue depicts Strahd, to whom the cultists made sacrifices in the vain hope that he might reveal his darkest secrets to them. If the characters touch the statue or take the crystal orb from Strahd&rsquo;s hand, five Shadow form around the statue and attack them. The shadows (the spirits of former cultists) pursue those who flee beyond the room&rsquo;s confines.</p>

Ritual Chamber</h3><p>The cult used to perform rituals in this sunken room. The chanting heard throughout the dungeon originates here, yet when the characters arrive, the dungeon falls silent as the chanting mysteriously stops.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chanting stops as you peer into this forty-foot-square room. The smooth masonry walls provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and a breach in the west wall leads to a dark cave heaped with refuse. Murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The water is 2 feet deep. The ledges and central dais are 5 feet high (3 feet higher than the water&rsquo;s surface), and the chamber&rsquo;s ceiling is 16 feet high (11 feet above the dais and ledges). The chains dangling from the ceiling are 8 feet long; the cultists would shackle prisoners to the chains, dangle them above the altar, cut them open with knives, and allow the altar to be bathed in blood.</p>
<p>Half embedded in the east wall is a wooden wheel connected to hidden chains and mechanisms. A character can use an action to turn the wheel, raising or lowering the nearby portcullis (see <strong>area area 37</strong>).</p>
<p>The hole in the west wall leads to a naturally formed alcove. The half-submerged pile of refuse that fills it is a shambling mound, which the cultists dubbed Lorghoth the Decayer. It is asleep but awakens if attacked or if the characters summon the cultists but refuse to complete their ritual (see &ldquo;One Must Die!&rdquo; below). A character standing next to the mound can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<h4 id=one-must-die>

<blockquote>
<p>The chanting rises once more as thirteen dark apparitions appear on the ledges overlooking the room. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch&rsquo;s fire is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you&rsquo;d expect to see faces are voids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must die!&rdquo; they chant, over and over. &ldquo;One must die! One must die!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The apparitions are harmless figments that can&rsquo;t be damaged, turned, or dispelled.</p>
<p>Characters on the dais when the cultists appear must sacrifice a creature on the altar or face the cult&rsquo;s wrath; characters can ascertain what must be done with a successful DC 11 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check. To count as a sacrifice, a creature must die on the altar. The apparitions don&rsquo;t care what kind of creature is sacrificed, and they aren&rsquo;t fooled by illusions.</p>
<p>If the characters make the sacrifice, the cultists fade away, but their tireless chant of &ldquo;He is the Ancient. He is the Land,&rdquo; echoes again in the dungeon. Strahd is aware of the sacrifice, and Death House now does nothing to hinder the characters (see &ldquo;Endings&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>If the characters leave the dais without making the sacrifice, the cultists' chant changes: &ldquo;Lorghoth the Decayer, we awaken thee!&rdquo; This chant rouses the shambling mound and prompts it to attack. It pursues prey beyond the room but won&rsquo;t leave the dungeon. It can move through tunnels without squeezing and completely fills its space. At the start of the shambling mound&rsquo;s first turn, the chant changes again: &ldquo;The end comes! Death, be praised!&rdquo; If the shambling mound dies, the chanting stops and the apparitions vanish forever.</p>

When they return upstairs, they must roll initiative as they discover several architectural changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the windows are bricked up; the bricked-up windows and the outer walls are impervious to the party&rsquo;s weapon attacks and damage-dealing spells.</li>
<li>All the doors are gone, replaced by slashing scythe-blades. A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check to pass through a blade-trapped doorway unscathed. A character who spends 1 minute studying the blades in a particular doorway can try to take advantage of a momentary gap in their repeating movements and make a DC 15 Intelligence check instead. Failing either check, a character takes <wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll> slashing damage but manages to pass through the doorway. Any creature pushed through a doorway must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the damage. The blades can&rsquo;t be disarmed.</li>
<li>Every room that contains a fireplace, an oven, or a stove is filled with poisonous black smoke. The room is heavily obscured, and any creature that starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> poison damage.</li>
<li>The interior walls become rotted and brittle. Each 5-foot-section has AC 5 and 5 hit points, and can also be destroyed with a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. Each 5-foot section of wall that&rsquo;s destroyed causes a swarm of rats to pour out and attack. The swarm won&rsquo;t leave the house.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep track of initiative as the characters make their way through the house. Once they escape, they advance to 3rd level, and the house does no more to harm them.</p>
