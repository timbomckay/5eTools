<div class="gap-8 lg:grid items-start" style="grid-template-columns:auto 10rem">
<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Wine is the lifeblood of the Barovian people. It is one of the only indulgences left to them. Without it, many Barovians would lose their last shred of hope and succumb to utter despair.</p>
<p>Although the Vistani often bring wine from distant lands, they share it infrequently. Thus, most of Barovia&rsquo;s wine comes from one source: the Wizard of Wines winery and vineyard.</p>
<p>The Wizard of Wines was founded by a mage whose name is buried in the annals of history. The wizard fashioned three magic gems, each one as big as a pinecone, and planted them in the rich valley soil. These &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; gave rise to healthy grapevines, which produced sweet, plump grapes. Even after Strahd&rsquo;s curse settled over Barovia, the gems kept the vines and their grapes from succumbing to the darkness.</p>
<p>Strahd bequeathed the winery and vineyard to the noble Krezkov family as a reward for the family&rsquo;s loyalty. Later, an arranged marriage between the Krezkovs and the Martikov family led to the land being taken over by a Martikov descendant. The winery and vineyard have been tended by the Martikovs ever since. At some point, the Martikov family became infected with widespread lycanthropy. The current patriarch, Davian Martikov, is a wereraven, as are his children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="has-image block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</p>
<p>The wereravens provide the wine to Barovian taverns for free, knowing the good it brings to the Barovian people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why, it is nothing to become an animal, for that is the true nature of every man. We are not meant to wear crowns and drink from goblets.</p>
<p>—Strahd von Zarovich</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The winery is known for three wines: the unremarkable Purple Grapemash No. 3, the slightly more tantalizing Red Dragon Crush, and the rich Champagne du le Stomp. Ten years ago, one of the vineyard&rsquo;s magic gems was dug up and stolen, and as a result, the winery stopped producing its best vintage, the champagne. No one knows what happened to the gem. Davian Martikov blames his middle son, Urwin (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N2</strong>), for the loss because Urwin was on watch the night the gem was taken. Davian is convinced that Urwin shirked his duty to spend time with his betrothed, and the two men have been at odds ever since. To this day, Urwin steadfastly denies his father&rsquo;s accusation.</p>
<p>Adding to Davian&rsquo;s misery, the wereravens have been fending off frequent attacks by Baba Lysaga&rsquo;s scarecrow constructs. Three weeks ago, during one such attack, another gem was found, dug up, and taken. Davian believes that it is in the possession of Baba Lysaga (see chapter 10, <strong>area area U3</strong>).</p>
<p>Davian&rsquo;s belief is correct. The gem was a lucky find for Baba Lysaga, who had previously suspected that magic was the root of the vineyard&rsquo;s health but knew nothing of its source. Even after this great discovery, Baba Lysaga continues to send her scarecrows against the winery, antagonizing the wereravens like a bad neighbor.</p>
<p>Five days ago, evil druids stole the third and final gem and bore it to Yester Hill (chapter 14). The wereravens launched a counterattack on Yester Hill, hoping to get it back, but to no avail. The druids and their blights proved more than a match for the lycanthropes.</p>
<p>Two days ago, the druids returned with a horde of blights and drove Davian&rsquo;s family from the winery. They&rsquo;ve also poisoned the fermentation vats, leaving the winery with only a few bottles and barrels of drinkable wine.</p>
<p>Even if the characters succeed in helping the Martikovs reclaim the winery, wine production in the valley will eventually stop as the vineyard dies off. Only by recovering the magic gems and replanting them in the soil can the characters ensure that the Barovians aren&rsquo;t without wine to comfort them on dark, wretched nights.</p>

<a href=#approaching-the-vineyard class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Approaching the Vineyard</h2><p>A branch of the Old Svalich Road leads to the vineyard. If the characters approach along this path, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a half mile, the road becomes a muddy trail that meanders through the woods, descending gradually until the trees part, revealing a mist-shrouded meadow. The trail splits. One branch heads west into the valley, and the other leads south into dark woods. A wooden signpost at the intersection points west and reads, &ldquo;Vineyard.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters head west on the trail toward the vineyard, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A light drizzle begins to fall. Unpainted fences blindly follow the trail, which skirts north of a sprawling vineyard before bending south toward a stately building. The fog takes on ghostly forms as it swirls between the neatly tended rows of grapevines. Here and there, you see rope-handled half-barrels used for hauling grapes. North of the trail is a large stand of trees. A man wearing a dark cloak and cowl stands at the edge of the trees, beckoning you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beckoning figure is one of nine Wereraven (LG male and female humans) hiding in the grove north of the vineyard. If the characters ignore the cloaked figure and continue on to the winery, the wereravens keep their distance and wait to see what happens.</p>
<h3 id=the-martikov-family>
<a href=#the-martikov-family class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Martikov Family</h3><p>If the characters head toward the cloaked figure, the other wereravens emerge from the stand of trees and greet them in human form. They wear dark leather rain cloaks and cowls.</p>
<p>One of them is the current owner of the winery and vineyard, Davian Martikov, who is an old and suspicious man. Until he trusts the characters, he says nothing about the stolen gems but tells them that evil druids and blights have attacked the winery and forced his family to take refuge in the woods.</p>
<p>If the characters rid the winery of its invaders, Davian is grateful. Only then does he tell them that the vineyard&rsquo;s three magic &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; have been stolen. He describes them as gems the size and shape of pinecones, each one containing a glowing green light as bright as a torch. For the good of all Barovia, he urges the characters to travel to Berez (area U) and Yester Hill (area Y) to retrieve two of them. He has no idea what happened to the third gem.</p>
<p>Davian&rsquo;s group includes the following people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Davian</li>
<li>Adrian, his eldest son</li>
<li>Elvir, his youngest son</li>
<li>Stefania, his adult daughter</li>
<li>Dag Tomescu, Stefania&rsquo;s husband</li>
</ul>
<p>All five are members of the Keepers of the Feather (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N2</strong>). Also present are Stefania and Dag&rsquo;s four children: a teenage son named Claudiu, two young boys named Martin and Viggo, and a baby girl named Yolanda. The three youngest children are noncombatants; the boys are wereravens with 7 hit points each, and Yolanda is effectively a human with 1 hit point (she can&rsquo;t assume other forms yet).</p>
<p>If the characters come to the vineyard looking to obtain wine, Adrian can confirm that there are three barrels in the loading dock (<strong>area area W2</strong>), plus another three barrels and several wine bottles in the cellar (<strong>area area W14</strong>). There is more wine still fermenting (<strong>area area W9</strong>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Situated in the midst of the vineyard, the winery is an old, two-story stone building with multiple entrances, thick ivy covering every wall, and iron fencing along its roofline. The trail ends at an open loading dock on the ground floor.</p>
<p>A wooden stable of more recent construction is attached to the east side of the winery, next to the loading dock. West of the winery is a crumbling well and a wooden outhouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters reach the winery, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You hear the rustle of dead vines all around you. Inhuman shapes emerge from the vineyard, their limbs cracking as they trudge forth through the mist and rain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thirty Needle Blight (in six groups of five) emerge from the surrounding vineyard and make their way toward the characters and the winery. The blights are 120 feet away when they first become visible, and they have a walking speed of 30 feet. Characters can either barricade themselves inside the winery, thus keeping the needle blights at bay, or stand and fight. If they stay outside and fight, druids and blights from inside the winery join the battle on the rounds shown below.</p>

Fermentation Vats</h3><blockquote>
<p>The rich smell of fermenting wine fills this large, two-story chamber, which is dominated by four enormous wooden casks, each one eight feet wide and twelve feet tall. A wooden staircase in the center of the room climbs to a ten-foot-high wooden balcony that clings to the south wall, which has four windows set into it at balcony level. Stacked against the wall underneath the balcony are old, empty barrels with &ldquo;The Wizard of Wines&rdquo; burned into their sides. The balcony climbs another five feet as it continues along the west and east walls, ending at doors leading to the winery&rsquo;s upper level. Underneath these side balconies are several doors, some of which hang open. Beneath the sloping roof stretch thick rafters, upon which scores of ravens have quietly gathered. They watch you with great interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four Swarm of Ravens perch on the rafters but don&rsquo;t attack the characters under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Unless they have been drawn outside, twenty-four Twig Blight and one druid (NE female human) are also present. If they are here, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The balcony creaks, drawing your eye to a wild-looking figure hunched over the westernmost cask, pouring a flask of thick syrup into it. She wears a gown made of animal skins and a headdress with goat horns, and her hair is long and unkempt. Suddenly, you see something skittering across the floor. It looks like a tiny creature made of twigs. It moves from its hiding place under the stairs and disappears behind the easternmost cask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four containers are fermentation vats, where grape juice is mixed with other ingredients and turned into wine. The easternmost cask has split in the back, creating a 6-inch-wide, 6-foot-high opening through which the twig blights can pass. All twenty-four twig blights are hidden in the cask, ready to emerge and attack when commanded to do so. While inside the cask, they have total cover against attacks that originate outside the cask.</p>

</p>
<p>The druid is poisoning the fermentation vats. The three westernmost vats contain poisoned wine, enough to fill a total of twenty barrels. Drinking the poisoned wine has the same effect as drinking a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of poison</wc-fetch>. Pouring antitoxin into a vat neutralizes the poison, but it also spoils the taste of the wine. Casting a <wc-fetch type=spell>purify food and drink</wc-fetch> spell on a vat neutralizes the poison without spoiling the wine.</p>
<p>In addition to her animal skin gown and horned headdress, the druid wears necklaces of human teeth. If the characters attack the druid, she calls forth her twig blights. When that happens, the swarms of ravens descend from the rafters and begin attacking the blights. Each swarm tears apart one twig blight on each of its turns.</p>
<p>The sliding wooden doors along the north wall (leading to <strong>area area W5</strong>) are chained shut from the inside. The key to the padlock can be found in the office (<strong>area area W20</strong>).</p>

Wine Cellar</h3><p>In the winery&rsquo;s heyday, the wine cellar was packed with barrels awaiting shipment, but those days are long gone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wooden pillars and beams support the ten-foot-high ceiling of this ice-cold cellar, which is split in two by a five-foot-thick brick wall. A thin mist covers the floor. Each half of the cellar features an eight-foot tall wooden partition that doubles as a wine rack. The western rack stands empty, but the eastern one is half filled with wine bottles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless they have been drawn outside, five Needle Blight and one druid (NE male human) lurk in the eastern portion of the cellar. If they are here when the characters enter that part of the cellar, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something moves behind the eastern wine rack. Through the holes, you glimpse a half dozen humanoid figures, one with a full rack of antlers. You hear a gravelly voice mutter the words of a spell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On his first turn, from behind the wine rack, the druid casts a <wc-fetch type=spell>thunderwave</wc-fetch> spell, which shatters <wc-roll>1d20 + 10</wc-roll> of the wine bottles as it resounds throughout the cellar. The druid then orders the needle blights to attack.</p>
<p>The cellar gets markedly colder the closer one gets to the north wall. Against that wall in the eastern portion of the cellar rest three frosty barrels containing Purple Grapemash No. 3, a fact that is emblazoned on each barrel&rsquo;s side. A single bottle of Purple Grapemash No. 3 lies on the flagstone floor in the western half of the cellar.</p>
<p>The wine rack in the eastern half of the cellar holds forty bottles, the labels of which show that the wine is the winery&rsquo;s Red Dragon Crush.</p>
<p>A secret door between the two halves of the wine cellar can be pushed open to reveal a freezing cold passageway (area W15).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It takes some effort to push open the secret door, and you are greeted by a blast of cold air. A dark tunnel stretches for fifteen feet, ending at an archway beyond which lies a shallow cave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who have a light source can see brown mold covering the walls, floor, and ceiling around the archway and the cave beyond. Growing throughout this area, keeping the wine cellar cool, are ten patches of brown mold (see &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in chapter 5, &ldquo;Adventure Environments,&rdquo; of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). The characters are safe from the mold as long as they keep their distance.</p>

<p>The man is a druid (NE male human) who fights only if cornered. Otherwise, he tries to flee by dropping onto the wagon in the loading dock (<strong>area area W2</strong>).

<p>Davian, Adrian, and Elvir sleep in the westernmost room. Claudiu and his two younger brothers sleep in the easternmost room, where a few toys are scattered about. One of the toys seems to resemble a child&rsquo;s wooden rocking horse, except that the horse is black with wild eyes and has painted orange flames where its mane, tail, and hooves should be. Carved into the wooden nightmare is the name &ldquo;Beucephalus&rdquo; and, in smaller lettering, the slogan &ldquo;Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footlockers contain clothing and personal belongings, but nothing of value.</p>

Printing Press</h3><p>The door to this room hangs open.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this chamber are a desk, a chair, a tall wooden cabinet, and a strange contraption that takes up most of the northern end of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two Vine Blight and one druid (NE female human) are in the room unless they have been drawn elsewhere, If they are here, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three creatures are here. One appears human but is so caked with dirt and mud that it&rsquo;s hard to know for sure. Her hair is full of twigs, and her face is hidden behind a veil of moss. She is rooting through the contents of the cabinet and haphazardly tossing them onto the floor. Behind her stand two creatures made entirely of dead vines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The druid and the vine blights fight to the death.</p>
<p>Inside the cabinet is a key hanging on a loop of twine. The key unlocks the padlock on the sliding doors between the veranda (<strong>area area W5</strong>) and the fermentation vats (<strong>area area W9</strong>).</p>
<p>The contraption standing near the north wall is a printing press, which Davian Martikov uses to make wine bottle labels. The ink is made from wine and stored in bottles in the cabinet, along with pieces of parchment and jars of glue.</p>

<h3 id=wine-delivery>
<a href=#wine-delivery class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Wine Delivery</h3><p>After restoring the Martikovs to their rightful positions, the characters might ask them to deliver wine to the Blue Water Inn (chapter 5, <strong>area area N2</strong>), the Vistani in the camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, <strong>area area N9</strong>), or the burgomaster of Krezk (chapter 8, <strong>area area S2</strong>). A grateful Davian sets his sons to the task immediately. Adrian Martikov brings the three remaining wine barrels up from the cellar and sets them on the wagon while Elvir Martikov secures the horses. Adrian and Elvir make the delivery themselves, but they welcome the party&rsquo;s escort. If the characters don&rsquo;t volunteer for guard duty, Davian Martikov suggests they go along with the wine wagon to ensure its safety.</p>
<p>If the characters escort the wagon, check for a <strong>area random encounter</strong> once for each mile traveled. The wagon is also watched over by two Swarm of Ravens that swoop down to attack anything that threatens the wagon or the characters.</p>
<h4 id=development>
<a href=#development class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Development</h4><p>The characters can trade the six barrels of wine for a much-needed treasure in the possession of the Keepers of the Feather or the Vistani (see chapter 5, <strong>area areas N2q</strong> and <strong>area N9i</strong>), or they can use it to buy their way into the walled village of Krezk (chapter 8).</p>
<h3 id=wintersplinter-attacks>
<a href=#wintersplinter-attacks class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Wintersplinter Attacks</h3><p>If the characters leave the winery and return at a later time before dealing with Wintersplinter (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Druids' Ritual</strong>&rdquo; section in chapter 14), the enormous tree blight (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>) is sent from Yester Hill to ravage the vineyard and destroy the winery.</p>
<p>The characters arrive to find the grapevines trampled and the winery in ruins. Wintersplinter&rsquo;s tracks are clearly visible on the trail to the south. Characters who follow the tracks catch up with Wintersplinter as the blight slowly makes its way back to Yester Hill.</p>
<p>The Martikovs narrowly escape the carnage and flee to the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki (chapter 5, <strong>area area N2</strong>). Davian Martikov is crushed by the loss of the winery, and morale in Vallaki sinks to an all-time low as word of the winery&rsquo;s destruction spreads through town.</p>
<h4 id=development-1>
<a href=#development-1 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Development</h4><p>Three days after Wintersplinter&rsquo;s attack, Baba Lysaga (see chapter 10, <strong>area area U3</strong>) dispatches the seven Scarecrow from Berez and orders them to take up positions in the vineyard, to discourage the wereravens from returning. These scarecrows attack anyone who crosses the vineyard or approaches the ruined winery.</p>
