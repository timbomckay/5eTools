<p>A secret society of good-aligned wizards built the Amber Temple in the Balinok Mountains more than two thousand years ago. They needed a vault in which to contain the evil vestiges (remnants of dead, malevolent entities) they had captured and the hoard of forbidden knowledge they had amassed. They dedicated the temple to a god of secrets, whom they trusted to keep it hidden from the rest of the world until the end of time. Unfortunately for the wizards, even the will of a god couldn&rsquo;t prevent other evil creatures from learning the temple&rsquo;s location. The wizards were forced to guard the temple themselves, to keep its secrets from falling into villainous hands. The evil forces that were imprisoned within the temple eventually corrupted the wizards, turning them against one another.</p>
<p>The wizards were dead and gone by the time an evil archmage named Exethanter arrived at the temple. He breached the temple&rsquo;s wards, spoke to a vestige trapped in amber, and discovered the secret to becoming a lich. After his transformation, the lich Exethanter took over the temple and turned the skulls of it previous defenders into flameskulls under his command. Exethanter then took it upon himself to watch over the temple, not to hoard its evil secrets but to share them openly. Meanwhile, the evils within the temple fed on each other, growing in power.</p>

The temperature throughout the complex is âˆ’10 degrees Fahrenheit (âˆ’23 degrees Celsius). Characters who don&rsquo;t have heat sources, cold weather gear, or magic to protect them are subject to the effects of extreme cold, as described in the &ldquo;Weather&rdquo; section in chapter 5, &ldquo;Adventure Environments,&rdquo; of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. If Kasimir Velikov (see chapter 5, <strong>area area N9a</strong>) is with the party, his <wc-fetch type=item>ring of warmth</wc-fetch> protects him from the effects of the extreme cold.</p>

<p>When Strahd came to the temple seeking immortality, Exethanter sensed that he was a man of destiny. The evil powers in the temple felt something much stronger: a darkness that eclipsed their own. Strahd communed with these evil vestiges and forged a pact with them. When Strahd later murdered his brother Sergei, that pact was sealed with blood. Strahd transformed into a vampire, and the Dark Powers turned his land into a prison.</p>
<p>Strahd has returned to the temple several times to learn new magic and to find a means of escaping his fate, but the Dark Powers have no intention of giving him up. These recent years have been difficult for Exethanter, whose body and mind have been falling apart. The lich has grown weak and forgetful. He no longer remembers his name or his spells. He knows only that the Dark Powers that created Strahd&rsquo;s domain were born in the temple, and that these entities feed on the evil that Strahd represents. Strahd is the darkness that sustains them.</p>
<p>Characters who visit the temple can sense the presence of great evil. The dark vestiges imprisoned within the temple will try to corrupt them, offering them secrets and gifts in exchange for a taste of the evil that lurks within their true hearts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The road fades away under a covering of snow, but it takes you far enough to see the facade of some kind of temple carved into the sheer mountainside ahead. The front of the structure is fifty feet high and has six alcoves containing twenty-foot-tall statues. Each statue is carved from a single block of amber and depicts a faceless, hooded figure, its hands pressed together in a gesture of prayer. Between the two innermost statues is a twenty-foot-tall archway with a staircase leading down.</p>

<p>The amber statues are impervious to damage. Looking at one for long fills a viewer with unease.</p>

Temple of Lost Secrets</h3><blockquote>
<p>Four black marble columns support the vaulted ceiling of the temple, at the north end of which stands a forty-foot-tall statue of a cowled figure in flowing robes. The statue&rsquo;s stony hands are outstretched as if in the midst of casting a spell. Its face is a void of utter blackness. The ominous statue stands between two black marble balconies, one of which has partially collapsed and fallen on the temple&rsquo;s black marble floor, in front of an open doorway. The walls of the temple are sheathed in amber, and the doors leading from it are made of amber as well. Arched hallways coated with amber lead away from the temple to the west and east. Flanking these exits are alcoves that hold white marble statues of robed human wizards with pointed hats and golden staffs. One of them has toppled over and lies shattered on the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An arcanaloth named Neferon guards this temple from within the hollow head of the great statue (area X5a) and attacks characters on sight with its longer-ranged spells. Thanks to its <wc-fetch type=sense>truesight</wc-fetch>, the arcanaloth can see the <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and can see through magical darkness. Characters can&rsquo;t see Neferon unless they can penetrate the magical darkness that envelops the statue&rsquo;s face and head.</p>
<p>Once the arcanaloth begins casting spells, the three Flameskull in <strong>area area X17</strong> take up positions behind the arrow slits that overlook the temple and cast <wc-fetch type=spell>magic missile</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> spells at characters they can see.</p>
<p>The temple ceiling is 60 feet high. Wide, black marble staircases ascend 30 feet to the southern balcony (<strong>area area X4</strong>). The balconies that flank the statue (<strong>area areas X11</strong> and <strong>area X23</strong>) are 30 feet high as well.</p>
<p>Arrow slits cut into the walls of the upper galleries (<strong>area areas X8</strong> and <strong>area X17</strong>) and archer posts (<strong>area areas X13</strong> and <strong>area X25</strong>) look down on the temple. The amber glaze that covers the temple walls makes these arrow slits difficult to spot. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 12 or higher notice them. Creatures behind the arrow slits gain three-quarters cover.</p>
<p>The marble wizard statues stand 8 feet tall. Their 9-foot-tall golden staffs are made of wrought iron coated in peeling gold paint. The northeast statue fell over when an earth tremor collapsed the wall of its alcove.</p>

The darkness can be dispelled (DC 17).</p>
<p>A pair of 2-foot-wide eyeholes provides an unobstructed view of the temple floor south of the statue, as well as the southern balcony (<strong>area area X4</strong>). Looking through the eyes, one can&rsquo;t see the northern balconies (<strong>area areas X11</strong> and <strong>area X23</strong>), the areas beneath them, or anywhere behind or directly above the statue. The eyeholes grant the arcanaloth three-quarters cover against attacks that originate outside the head.</p>
<p>Neferon wears gold spectacles and a magic robe (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). It uses its <wc-fetch type=spell>alter self</wc-fetch> spell and <wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch> skill to pass itself off as an old human wizard with a long white beard named Heinrich Stolt. &ldquo;Heinrich&rdquo; feigns confusion. If the characters ask him why he attacked, he claims that he was guarding the temple. If the arcanaloth loses more than half of its hit points, it teleports to the temple floor, turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>, and flees by the safest route, attacking the characters again when it&rsquo;s safe to do so. The arcanaloth will not, under any circumstances, leave the Amber Temple.</p>

It is warded by an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell that prevents it from being opened, but knocking on the door three times causes it to swing open for 1 minute, revealing a dusty stone staircase.

<p>The ceiling here is 20 feet high. Beyond the open doors to the north, the characters can see a long, wide hallway with amber-covered walls (<strong>area area X8</strong>).</p>

From the bottom of the shaft, it&rsquo;s another 10-foot drop to the floor of area X33a. The shaft has abundant handholds and can be climbed without an ability check, but characters must still drop the last 10 feet to reach the floor below. If the characters make a lot of noise, the three Flameskull in area X33a float up the shaft and attack them. The flameskulls also attack anyone they can hear attempting to descend the shaft.</p>

<p>This chamber is brightly lit by red copper lanthorns that hang from the ceiling. The walls are sheathed in amber that has been shaped into bas-reliefs of wizards with spellbooks. Stairs to the north and south descend twenty feet to an obsidian lectern, behind which a slab of black slate hangs from chains. Between the stairs are descending rows of red marble benches.</p>

<p>The hanging lanthorns have <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast on them. The black slate slab once served as a chalkboard and has a few chalk marks on it.</p>

<p>Hiding behind the lectern is Vilnius (NE male human mage) and his <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> quasit familiar. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 17 or higher notice him. A character who actively searches the room for hidden occupants spots Vilnius with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>Vilnius wears scorched robes, his unkempt hair is half burned away, and his face and arms are covered with blisters from magic fire. He is the apprentice of Jakarion, the dead wizard in <strong>area area X17</strong>. After the flameskulls there incinerated his master, the wounded Vilnius retreated here. He eats vermin to survive. The amber golem has been patrolling the hallway outside (<strong>area area X8</strong>), and Vilnius won&rsquo;t leave this room until he knows the golem has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Vilnius is a greedy, treacherous coward. He curses his dead master for leading them to this wretched land. If the characters try to befriend him, he is suspicious of their intentions. He would like to retrieve his dead master&rsquo;s staff and spellbook, but otherwise he has no interest in exploring more of the Amber Temple. He knows the following information about the place:</p>
<ul>
<li>The temple is a haven for forbidden knowledge.</li>
<li>Flameskullsâ€”constructs made from the remains of dead wizardsâ€”guard the temple.</li>
<li>Barbaric mountain folk use the temple for shelter.</li>

<p>When they aren&rsquo;t expecting trouble, the gladiator and the berserkers sit on the floor, sharpening their weapons, while the dire wolf sleeps in the middle of the room.

<p>The ceiling here is 20 feet high. Amber doors lead south to a hallway (<strong>area area X18</strong>) and east to a shattered balcony (area X23).</p>

<p>Hidden in plain sight amid the feast on the table is a green copper ewer embossed with images of dancing bears, elks, and wolves. The ewer, like the table, isn&rsquo;t illusory. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the ewer.

Two pairs of alcoves line the north and south walls of the shrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The obsidian statue is 4 feet tall, weighs 250 pounds, and depicts the same nameless god that stands watch in the main temple (<strong>area area X5</strong>). Any living creature that enters this room must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be drawn to the statue as though affected by the sympathy effect of an <wc-fetch type=spell>antipathy/sympathy</wc-fetch> spell. The corpses lying in front of the statue are the remains of two human wizards who came here separately, failed their saving throws, and starved to death while under the spell&rsquo;s effect. The lich in <strong>area area X27</strong> destroyed the wizards' spellbooks and other possessions. Covering the statue or removing it from this shrine suppresses its magic and ends its sympathy effect on anyone.</p>
<p>A pair of amber doors in the east wall open into area X25. A secret door is set in the back of one of the northern alcoves. Pulling it open releases hundreds of skulls (see area X26).</p>

Secret Alcove</h3><p>Two secret doors lead to this room. When either door is pulled open, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of skulls fall out of a cavity behind the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room has a 30-foot-high ceiling and is packed floor to ceiling with human skulls. It takes 5 minutes for a single character to clear a path into the room. Multiple characters can work together to clear a path more quickly. Once the skulls are cleared away, characters can search the room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attached to the thirty-foot-high ceiling of this dark sepulcher is an upside-down iron chest with a barrel-shaped lid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iron chest on the ceiling is held in place with <wc-fetch type=item>sovereign glue</wc-fetch>, and its lid is sealed with an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell. The chest is impervious to weapon damage. Prying it open requires a successful DC 25 Strength check, assuming the characters can reach it. The inside of the chest is lined with lead.</p>
<p>If the chest&rsquo;s lid is opened, the floor of this room disappears (as if affected by a <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch> spell), creating a 10-foot-square hole above <strong>area area X39</strong>. Creatures standing on the floor when it disappears fall 30 feet, landing in the northwest corner of area X39.</p>
<p>The iron chest is empty.</p>

Lich&rsquo;s Lair</h3><blockquote>
<p>This fifteen-foot-high room contains the trappings of royalty: ornate furniture, exquisite rugs and tapestries, and decorative statuary. Everywhere you look are lit candelabras atop small tables. The beauty of the decor is undone by thick dust and cobwebs. Standing in the center of the room is a decrepit skeleton clad in tattered robes.</p>
<p>Red pinpoints of light burn in the skeleton&rsquo;s eye sockets. &ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo; it asks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lich has fewer hit points than normal (99 hit points), doesn&rsquo;t remember its name (Exethanter), and has forgotten all of its prepared spells. It does know its cantrips. In its current condition, the lich has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP). A <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell restores the lich&rsquo;s memory and all of its spells. Another casting of the spell restores its normal hit point maximum (135).</p>
<p>If the characters restore its memory, the lich gives them the passwords to all the locked doors in the Amber Temple (with the exception of the door into <strong>area area X28</strong>, where its phylactery is hidden). It also provides all the information pertaining to Strahd and the temple presented at the start of this chapter. If the characters think to ask, it provides them with the command words for any of the books in the library (<strong>area area K30</strong>).</p>
<p>If the characters restore its body, it offers to escort them while they explore the temple. The other creatures that inhabit the temple don&rsquo;t threaten the characters as long as the lich is with them.</p>
<p>The lich defends itself if attacked and turns to dust if it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
<p>The lich assumes that the characters have come seeking knowledge and power. If it is inclined to help them, it tells them how the amber sarcophagi work (as explained in the &ldquo;<strong>area Amber Sarcophagi</strong>&rdquo; sidebar). The lich has no alliance with or animosity toward Strahd, and no interest in challenging Strahd for control of Barovia.</p>
<p>The furnishings here are in poor condition and fall apart easily.</p>
<p>There are three secret doors in this room. The secret door to area X28 has an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell cast on it. The password to suppress the spell is &ldquo;Exethanter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behind the secret door is a small, dusty room. Rising from the floor in the eastern half of the room is a scaly arm and claw clutching a small box made of bone.</p>

Preserved Library</h3><blockquote>
<p>This stone library has twenty-foot-high walls and a thirty-foot-high vaulted ceiling. Covering the ceiling is a fresco that depicts angels being set ablaze in a hell. A black marble railing encloses a gold marble staircase that spirals gently down a thirty-foot-wide, thirty-foot-deep shaft to the north. Against the gray walls stand six ten-foot-tall, black marble bookcases. On their shelves are hundreds of well-preserved tomes. Embroidered rugs, chairs, and lit candelabras fill the southern half of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to <strong>area area X42</strong>. Peering over the railing reveals crates in that area.</p>
<p>There are no ladders here to reach the high bookshelves. (The wizards who built this place used <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> spells.) All the books appear to have blank covers and empty pages. Holding a book while speaking its secret command word causes the book&rsquo;s text to magically appear. Only the lich in <strong>area area X27</strong> knows the command word for each book, and only if its memory is restored. A <wc-fetch type=spell>true seeing</wc-fetch> spell also allows one to see the magically obfuscated text. The tomes mostly contain vile, forbidden lore. Many spellbooks are hidden here, collectively holding every wizard spell in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook.</p>
<p>A book that is taken from the library disintegrates as the magic that preserves it is dispelled. The room&rsquo;s furnishings, which are also magically preserved, deteriorate and become brittle if taken from the room.</p>
<p>The secret door in the center of the west wall can be pulled open to reveal an empty room (area X29). The one in the center of the south wall can be pulled open to reveal a staircase that descends 30 feet to another secret door leading to <strong>area area X5</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You smell the horrid perfume of the ancient dead. Stone niches along the walls of these catacombs hold human-shaped amber husks, bones, and tattered shrouds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters enter these catacombs, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tall, iron candlesticks stand in alcoves. Their candles ignite as you enter, casting flickering light upon the walls and causing the shattered amber to glitter.</p>

<p>The magic candles ignite when a living creature enters the catacombs and melt away if taken from the area.</p>

Trapped inside the block is a sliver or wisp of utter darkness no more than a few inches long. The darkness is the vestige of a dead and hateful godâ€”a shard of pure evil with shreds of sentience and awareness. The vestige can&rsquo;t be harmed or controlled, and it is immune to all conditions.</p>
<p>An amber sarcophagus has AC 16, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying one causes the vestige trapped within it to disappear, leaving no trace. You choose whether it is banished or destroyed.</p>
<p>A creature that touches the amber sarcophagus forms a telepathic link with the vestige inside. The vestige offers the creature a dark gift. The creature must willingly accept the gift to gain its benefits. A dark gift is described to the creature in general terms; its precise game effect isn&rsquo;t revealed until the creature accepts the gift. For example, a creature that touches Fekre&rsquo;s sarcophagus in area X33a is offered the power to spread disease. That the gift grants the ability to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>contagion</wc-fetch> spell is not articulated.</p>
<p>A dark gift functions like a charm (see &ldquo;Supernatural Gifts&rdquo; in chapter 7, &ldquo;Treasure,&rdquo; of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). A creature doesn&rsquo;t receive a dark gift if it is being manipulated or coerced, or if it declines the gift. Once it receives a dark gift, a creature can never receive that same dark gift again.</p>
<p>The instant a dark gift is bestowed, the creature receiving it undergoes a transformation, gaining a sinister physical trait or flaw, or one of each. Unless the text states otherwise, a trait or a flaw that accompanies this gift can&rsquo;t be removed by anything short of a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell or divine intervention.</p>
<p>Each time a non-evil creature accepts a dark gift, it must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature&rsquo;s alignment changes to evil. A character who turns evil becomes an NPC under the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s control, although the DM can allow the player to continue playing the evil character.</p>

Sealed Treasury</h3><p>The amber doors to the south are sealed with an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell. The password to suppress the spell is &ldquo;Dhaviton.&rdquo; A character can push open the doors with a successful DC 25 Strength check. The doors (AC 15, 60 hit points) can also be smashed. If the doors are reduced to 0 hit points, a <wc-fetch type=spell>greater invisibility</wc-fetch> spell is cast on the amber golem in this room. The spell lasts for 1 minute.</p>

<p>Piles of treasure are heaped against the west and east walls of this stone room.</p>

<p>If the golem is visible, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A ten-foot-tall statue carved from amber in the likeness of a hawk-headed humanoid stands in a wide alcove to the north. Behind it, a crack has formed in the wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ceiling here is 30 feet high and flat. The statue in the northern alcove is an amber golem (use the stat block for the stone golem in the Monster Manual). It attacks any creature that disturbs the treasure. The golem can leave the room but can&rsquo;t leave the Amber Temple.</p>

<a href=#rahadins-prayer class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Rahadin&rsquo;s Prayer</h3><p>Strahd&rsquo;s loyal chamberlain, Rahadin (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>), believes that his master forged a pact with the nameless god of secrets to whom the Amber Temple is dedicated. The dusk elf comes to the temple on occasion to petition the dark god into releasing his master from his torment.</p>
<p>Rahadin rides a <wc-fetch type=spell>phantom steed</wc-fetch> along Tsolenka Pass to the Amber Temple and kneels before the great statue in <strong>area area X5</strong>. (The arcanaloth that guards the temple knows Rahadin and doesn&rsquo;t harm him. The arcanaloth and the flameskulls don&rsquo;t attack other visitors until Rahadin is killed or leaves.) Rahadin then pulls out a live toad, swallows it whole as a sacrifice, and offers a gesture of supplication to the secret god.</p>
<h4 id=development-2>
<a href=#development-2 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Development</h4><p>Rahadin knows that Strahd will deal with the characters when he sees fit. If the characters confront the dusk elf, he defends himself but won&rsquo;t cause them any permanent harm. Strahd&rsquo;s chamberlain would sooner die than allow himself to be captured. Rahadin doesn&rsquo;t divulge his reason for visiting the temple, or even who is he or what role he serves. Left to his own devices, he rides back to Castle Ravenloft.</p>
<h3 id=kasimirs-dark-gift>
<a href=#kasimirs-dark-gift class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Kasimir&rsquo;s Dark Gift</h3><p>If Kasimir Velikov (see <strong>area appendix D</strong> and chapter 5, <strong>area area N9a</strong>) finds his way to area X42 and accepts the dark gift of Zhudun, he then asks the characters to accompany him to the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft so that he can restore the life of his centuries-dead sister, Patrina Velikovna (see chapter 4, area K84, <strong>area crypt 21</strong>).</p>
<h4 id=development-3>
<a href=#development-3 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Development</h4><p>If Kasimir succeeds in his quest, the newly resurrected Patrina (NE female dusk elf archmage) feigns repentance until she regains her strength and her spells, whereupon she travels to Castle Ravenloft and attempts to return to Strahd, seeking to become his vampire bride at last. The mutilation of her brother at the hands of Rahadin, Strahd&rsquo;s chamberlain, doesn&rsquo;t sit well with her. She hopes to avenge her brother and distract the characters by setting them on a path to killing Rahadin, who has long opposed her marriage to Strahd.</p>
<p>Strahd has lost interest in Patrina as a consort. Given the chance, he turns her into a vampire spawn and puts her back in her cryptâ€”a fate she would do everything in her power to prevent. Her attraction to Strahd is outmatched by a desire to increase her own power. She is no one&rsquo;s plaything.</p>
