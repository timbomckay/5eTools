<p>Castle Ravenloft was built atop the ruin of an older fortress by artisans, wizards, and workers loyal to Strahd&rsquo;s family. Strahd rewarded the castle&rsquo;s genius architect, Artimus, with a crypt in the castle&rsquo;s catacombs. The castle was named after Strahd&rsquo;s mother, Ravenovia, who also lies entombed below.</p>
<p>The poster map that accompanies this book displays the castle in its entirety. Map 1 on the poster shows a diagram of the castle&rsquo;s face, and the other maps show the castle&rsquo;s interior and exterior areas. All those locations are described in this chapter, starting in the &ldquo;<strong>area Walls of Ravenloft</strong>&rdquo; section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I called for my family, long unseated from their ancient thrones, and brought them here to settle in the castle Ravenloft.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tome of Strahd</li>
</ul>

<p>Angry Commoner who have entered the castle brandish torches and pitchforks in a ridiculous display of force. Everywhere they go, they shout for justice. They follow the characters unless prevented from doing so. As long as these Barovians are with the adventurers, random encounters occur on a roll of 9 or higher.</p>

<p>Characters can try to hide from the witch (who has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch>) or catch her by surprise. This Barovian witch is one of the servants of Strahd dwelling in <strong>area area K56</strong>. She is calling out the name of her black cat familiar, which has gone missing.

<p>The Crawling Claw gang up on one party member. During the confusion, one of the claws tries to crawl into the character&rsquo;s backpack and hide there. It makes a Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check contested by the character&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score.

<p>The groans are coming from a Strahd zombie that is missing both of its legs, so that only its head, torso, and arms remain. It uses its arms to drag itself across the floor. The crawling zombie has 15 hit points remaining.</p>

Choose one character in the back rank of the party&rsquo;s marching order, and read the following text to that character&rsquo;s player:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You feel a gentle tap on your shoulder but see nothing behind you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the character who is touched by Ezmerelda reacts in an alarming or threatening manner, she hastily whispers, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened. We&rsquo;re on the same side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ezmerelda is hunting Strahd, but her efforts to corner the vampire have so far been thwarted, and she fears that she might be in over her head. If the characters don&rsquo;t ask her to join the party, she wishes them well and goes on her way (perhaps to be encountered again later). If they invite her to accompany them, Ezmerelda tests the characters' knowledge about vampires by asking them questions such as &ldquo;Have you ever seen a vampire change its form?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you know how to counteract a vampire&rsquo;s regenerative ability?&rdquo; Whatever their answers, she ultimately agrees to come along.</p>
<p>This random encounter happens only once. If this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A massive wall juts out to connect the outer walls of the castle with the keep. A twenty-foot-wide, twenty-foot-tall archway offers passage through the connecting wall but is blocked by a rusting iron portcullis.</p>

<p>The portcullis is unlocked and can be lifted with a successful DC 15 Strength check. It can also be opened with a command word that only Strahd and Cyrus Belview (<strong>area area K62</strong>) know. Unless the portcullis is wedged or propped open, it falls back into place once it is let go.</p>

<p>Dark clouds overhead drizzle constantly. A flagstone avenue passes between empty outbuildings, leading to a stone-paved overlook. The overlook has a low stone wall adorned with outward-facing gargoyle carvings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a character peers over the balcony, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A flash of lightning illuminates the dismal village of Barovia, its rooftops visible above a smothering blanket of fog one thousand feet below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a character who has a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 15 or higher peers over the wall, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Underneath the platform on which you stand, about one hundred feet down, a stone construction protrudes from the cliff face. Three dirt-caked windows are set into it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The windows are so dirty as to be opaque, although a character within reach of one can scrape the dirt away and see a dusty tomb beyond (<strong>area area K88</strong>). Characters who try to reach the windows from the overlook must descend 110 feet and move 20 feet back under the platform. This descent can&rsquo;t be accomplished without the aid of magic or the use of a climber&rsquo;s kit.</p>
<p>Anyone who falls from the overlook plummets 1,000 feet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ornate outer doors of the castle hang open, flanked by fluttering torches in iron sconces. Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one or more characters approach from <strong>area area K1</strong> and come within 10 feet of the double doors, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The doors in front of you suddenly swing open, revealing a grand hall filled with the sound of organ music.</p>

<p>A set of double doors to the west appears to be, or to lead to, an exit from the castle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters enter from either direction, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overhead, in the vaulted entry foyer, four statues of dragons glare down, their eyes flickering in the torchlight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If anyone except Strahd enters this area through the doors that adjoin area K8, the dragons come alive, drop to the floor hissing and spitting, and attack. The dragons don&rsquo;t attack characters who enter this area from <strong>area area K1</strong>, heading east. The dragons are four Red Dragon Wyrmling, and they have instructions to allow guests to enter the castle, but not to leave it. If intruders vacate this area, the dragons fly up to their perches and revert to stone. In their stone forms, they are impervious to weapon damage. The dragons never leave the room.</p>

Great Entry</h3><blockquote>
<p>Cobwebs stretch between the columns that support the vaulted ceiling of a great, dusty hall dimly lit by sputtering torches in iron sconces. The torches cast odd shadows across the faces of eight stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by decay. Double doors of bronze stand closed to the east. To the north, a wide staircase climbs into darkness. A lit hallway to the south contains another set of bronze doors, through which you hear sad and majestic organ tones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The southern hallway is described in <strong>area area K9</strong>. The wide staircase leads up to <strong>area area K19</strong>.</p>
<p>If the characters are here by invitation, add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An elf with brown skin and long black hair descends the wide staircase, quiet as a cat. He wears a gray cloak over black studded leather armor and has a polished scimitar hanging from his belt. &ldquo;My master is expecting you,&rdquo; he says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The elf is Rahadin, the castle chamberlain (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>). He fights only if attacked. Otherwise, he leads the characters to the dining hall (<strong>area area K10</strong>), points them inside, pulls the doors shut behind them, and withdraws to <strong>area area K72</strong> by way of the South Tower Stair (<strong>area area K21</strong>).</p>

<p>Torchlight flutters against the walls of this vaulted hall. To the east, an arched hallway stretches for twenty feet, ending at a spiral staircase that goes up and down. Next to the hallway, a suit of armor, oiled and glistening, stands at attention in a shallow alcove.

Dining Hall</h3><p>The first time the characters enter this room, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three enormous crystal chandeliers brilliantly illuminate this magnificent chamber. Pillars of stone stand against dull white marble walls, supporting the ceiling. In the center of the room, a long, heavy table is covered with a fine white satin cloth. The table is laden with many delectable foods: roasted beast basted in a savory sauce, roots and herbs of every taste, and sweet fruits and vegetables. Places are set for each of you with fine, delicate china and silver. At each place is a crystal goblet filled with an amber liquid with a delicate, tantalizing fragrance.</p>
<p>At the center of the far west wall, between floor-to-ceiling mirrors, stands a massive organ. Its pipes blare out a thunderous melody that speaks in its tone of greatness and despair. Seated at the organ, facing away from you, a single caped figure pounds the keys in raptured ecstasy. The figure suddenly stops, and as a deep silence falls over the dining hall, it slowly turns toward you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure is an illusion of Strahd. It welcomes the characters and invites them to dine. The illusion acts like Strahd and plays the part of the gracious host, speaking kindly and telling the characters that they&rsquo;re free to explore the castle. &ldquo;Strahd&rdquo; might talk about his family or shed light on the castle&rsquo;s history, but the illusion provides no useful information about the castle&rsquo;s inhabitants, treasures, or dangers other than to say that the castle doesn&rsquo;t receive many guests. The illusory vampire converses with the characters for no more than 3 rounds, never moving from the organ bench. When the time is up, or if the illusion is attacked, it simply disappears with a mocking laugh.</p>
<p>The moment the figure disappears, a fierce, bone-chilling wind rises up and roars through the hall, putting out all open flames. The characters hear the screech of ancient hinges and the solid thud of many heavy doors slamming shut, one after another, into the distance. They also hear the portcullis clang shut and the tired groan of the aged drawbridge pulling up. Finally, unless the doors to this room are being held open, they slam shut (but do not lock). If the characters open the doors, they see that all the torches in areas K7, K8, and K9 have gone out.</p>
<p>The organ appears locked in place and immovable, but a character who makes a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices scratch marks on the floor that suggest that the organ can be slid outward. A character who tries pushing various keys and pedals discovers that one of the pedals, when depressed, causes the organ to slide outward about 2 feet, allowing access to a secret door in the back wall that swings open into area K11. Because this secret door is hidden behind the organ, it can&rsquo;t be found and opened until the organ is moved out of the way.</p>
<p>The food on the table is tasty, the wine delicious.</p>

Chapel</h3><blockquote>
<p>Dim, colored light filters through tall, broken, and boarded-up windows of stained glass, illuminating the ancient chapel of Ravenloft. A few bats flutter about near the top of the ninety-foot-high domed ceiling. A balcony runs the length of the west wall, fifty feet above the floor. In the center of the balcony, two dark shapes are slumped in tall chairs.</p>
<p>Benches coated with centuries of dust lie about the floor in jumbled disarray. Beyond this debris, lit by a piercing shaft of light, an altar stands upon a stone platform. The sides of the altar are carved with bas-reliefs of angelic figures entwined with grape vines. The light from above falls directly on a silver statuette. A cloaked figure is draped over the altar, and a black mace lies on the floor near its feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure slumped on the altar is all that remains of Gustav Herrenghast, a lawful evil human cleric who tried to obtain the <wc-fetch type=item>Icon of Ravenloft</wc-fetch> and did not survive the attempt.

High Tower Staircase</h3><blockquote>
<p>The large flagstones of this spiraling staircase lead up and down around a twenty-foot-wide stone core. Cobwebs fill the staircase, making it difficult to see even the ceiling. Heavy beams sag overhead from centuries of supporting weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The staircase starts at <strong>area area K84</strong> and spirals upward around a central shaft (<strong>area area K18a</strong>), climbing 300 feet to the top of the high tower (<strong>area area K59</strong>).</p>
<p>A recently constructed masonry wall blocks the staircase 10 feet below the landing west of area K17. A chink in this wall allows gas (or a vampire in gaseous form) to pass from one side of the wall to the other. A character who inspects the wall closely can spot the chink with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. The wall is too sturdy for characters to knock down, but they can create a hole wide enough to crawl through in 1 hour, or reduce the entire wall to a pile of masonry bricks and rubble in 2 hours.</p>
<p>Thirty feet below the masonry wall and 50 feet above the foot of the steps, a small crack has formed in the outer wall of the stairwell. The crack is 1/2 inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to the castle&rsquo;s wine cellar (<strong>area area K63</strong>). Characters can notice the crack automatically as they climb or descend the stairs. Widening the crack enough to squeeze through the wall requires major excavation and would take several days.</p>
<p>The shaft that these stairs wrap around (<strong>area area K18a</strong>) runs vertically from <strong>area area K59</strong> to <strong>area area K84</strong> without any holes or obstructions. The inner wall of the stairwell, between the staircase and the shaft, is solid.</p>

<p>The shaft is dark and choked with cobwebs. A rushing wind causes the webs to stir. Climbing the shaft is impossible without the aid of magic or the use of a climber&rsquo;s kit, since there are few handholds.</p>
<p>The bats in the catacombs (<strong>area area K84</strong>) fly up the shaft at night, exiting Castle Ravenloft through various arrow slits and holes in the tower&rsquo;s peak (<strong>area area K59</strong>). After feeding, they return by the same route.</p>

Grand Landing</h3><blockquote>
<p>Massive stairs rise to a landing twenty feet wide by forty feet long. Stone arches support a ceiling covered with frescoes twenty feet overhead. The frescoes depict armored knights on horseback, their finer features faded beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Dust floats in the air here. At each end of the south wall, a staircase rises into darkness. Between the staircases are twin alcoves, each one containing a standing suit of armor covered with dark stains. Each suit of armor clutches a mace, the &ldquo;business end&rdquo; of which is shaped like a dragon&rsquo;s head. Words engraved on the arches above the suits of armor have been scratched out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both staircases on the south wall climb to <strong>area area K25</strong>. The massive stairs lead down to <strong>area area K8</strong>. Anyone who crosses in front of the alcoves along the south wall activates the suits of armor.</p>
<p>Both suits of armor are mechanical traps, each one activated by a pressure plate hidden in the floor in front of its alcove. A character who searches for traps in one of these locations notices both pressure plates with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>When 40 or more pounds of weight are placed on a pressure plate, the suit of armor nearest to that plate springs forward, flailing its arms and wielding its mace. Any creature standing on a pressure plate when its trap triggers must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage from the flailing armor. After leaping out and attacking, the armor retracts. The pressure plate resets after 1 minute, after which its armor trap can be triggered again.</p>
<p>The suits of armor act much like metal puppetsâ€”a little joke intended to spook visitors more than damage them. A pressure plate can be disabled by a character who uses thieves' tools and makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A trap can also be disabled by destroying its suit of armor, which has AC 18, 5 hit points, and immunity to psychic and poison damage.</p>

<p>A mosaic floor adds a touch of color to the otherwise dark, cold, empty tower that rises above you. A spiral staircase rises slowly into darkness, hugging the outer wall. In the center of the room, another set of stairs leads down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The staircase in the center of the floor (<strong>area area K20a</strong>) leads down to <strong>area area K71</strong>.</p>
<p>The spiral staircase has no railing and connects the main floor of the castle with each level above it. First, the staircase climbs 50 feet to a landing (shown on map 4), from which an open archway leads to <strong>area area K13</strong>. East of that opening is a secret door that conceals a ladder leading down to <strong>area area K34</strong>.</p>
<p>The stairs ascend another 40 feet to another landing (shown on map 5), with archways that lead to <strong>area areas K45</strong> and <strong>area K46</strong>, and then climb another 100 feet to a landing beneath the tower&rsquo;s heart (shown on map 8).

When the characters set foot on the staircase for the first time, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you step onto the spiral staircase, a reddish light flares high overhead, then settles into a dull, pulsing red glow. You now see the full immensity of this tower. The spiral staircase circles up the tower&rsquo;s full height. The tower, sixty feet wide at its base, becomes narrower as it climbs. At the pinnacle of the hollow tower, a large crystal heart pulsates with red light. Above the heart, the stairs continue upward.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Have the characters and the Heart of Sorrow roll initiative. If the characters leave the tower and later return, they can reroll initiative, but the heart&rsquo;s initiative count doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>The awakened tower shakes and pitches on the Heart of Sorrow&rsquo;s initiative count. Any creature on the stairs or hanging on a tower wall at the start of the heart&rsquo;s turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the base of the tower. Characters who are crawling on the staircase or who lie <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> on the stairs succeed automatically.</p>
<p>The Heart of Sorrow is a 10-foot-diameter red crystal heart that floats near the top of the tower. Characters standing on the nearby stairs can make melee attacks against the heart, provided their weapons have a reach of at least 10 feet. The glass heart has AC 15 and 50 hit points. If the heart is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters, and its crystal shards transform into blood, which rains down on the tower interior and staircase. The destruction of the Heart of Sorrow causes the tower to stop shuddering, and the interior of the tower becomes dark. Destroying the heart earns the characters 1,500 XP.</p>
<p>Strahd and the Heart of Sorrow are connected, such that any damage Strahd takes is transferred to the heart. If the heart absorbs damage that drops it to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and Strahd takes any leftover damage. The Heart of Sorrow regains all its hit points at dawn if it has at least 1 hit point remaining.</p>
<p>The Heart of Sorrow is held aloft by the will of Strahd. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on it has no effect.</p>

<p>Dim light filters in through a dust-caked window in the east wall. A door next to the window leads to the castle&rsquo;s northeast courtyard.Everything in this room is coated with dust, including a large, heavy table in the center of the floor. A thick book lies open on a desk, with an inkwell and a quill next to it. There is a broken door in the north wall, and a staircase in the south wall plunges into darkness. On each side of the staircase, a skeletal figure draped in gleaming chain mail stands sagging at attention, holding a rusty halberd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The skeletons, which were assembled by Cyrus Belview (see <strong>area area K62</strong>), are held together with wire frames and hung on pegs. They pose no threat.</p>
<p>The staircase descends to <strong>area area K62</strong>. The east door leading to the courtyard is swollen in its frame and requires a successful DC 10 Strength check to force open. The north door is cracked and hangs loose on its hinges; beyond it lies another dust-filled chamber (<strong>area area K24</strong>).</p>
<p>The ancient book is weathered and brittle, but the ink in the well is fresh. At the top of each page is scribed the message &ldquo;Please register for your own convenience and that of your next of kin.&rdquo; The book is more than half-filled with names, all of them illegible.</p>

<p>Dim light from the courtyard falls into this great hall through the broken glass and iron latticework of a large window in the west wall. This immense room is a place of chilly, brooding darkness.

Farther south, a single door also leads from the east wall. Staircases at both ends of the north wall lead down.</p>

<p>This twenty-foot-high hall has a dark, vaulted ceiling draped with cobwebs. A low moan seems to travel the length of the corridor as it rises and falls, intoning sadness and despair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moaning is only the wind.</p>
<p>Characters who examine the ceiling can, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check, spot pulleys and a rope that run the full length of the corridor along the ceiling, well hidden by the cobwebs. These items are explained in &ldquo;Flight of the Vampire&rdquo; below.</p>
<p>Halfway down the hall on the south side is a narrow secret door that can be pulled open to reveal <strong>area area K31</strong>.</p>

It wears a black cloak, its fangs are bared, and its arms and clawed fingers are outstretched in a threatening manner. The mannequin is attached to a rope that runs through pulleys fastened along the length of the hallway ceiling.</p>
<p>When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the hall from either direction, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You hear a scraping sound of stone against stone, followed by the squeaking of a bat. In the direction of the noise, you see the fanged visage, outstretched claws, and flapping black cape of a vampire bearing down on you from above! A deep, throaty chuckle fills the hall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scraping noise is the sound of the hidden compartment opening, and the squeaking is the sound of the pulleys supporting the weight of the mannequin as it glides through the air. The chuckling is a harmless magical effect similar to that created by a <wc-fetch type=spell>prestidigitation</wc-fetch> cantrip.</p>
<p>Have the players roll initiative, and run this as a combat encounter with the &ldquo;vampire&rdquo; acting on initiative count 5. On its turn, the mannequin flies over the characters, 10 feet above the floor, and doesn&rsquo;t stop until it reaches the east end of the hall. On its next turn, it reverses direction and flies back to its compartment. The trap resets after 1 minute.</p>
<p>A character who attacks the mannequin from the floor needs a range of at least 10 feet. The mannequin has AC 15 and 10 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. If the mannequin is reduced to 0 hit points while in the air, it falls to the floor.</p>

<p>Two Strahd Zombie (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>) are slouched on the thrones. They remain motionless until one of them is disturbed or another creature comes within a zombie&rsquo;s reach, whereupon they attack.</p>

<p>The figure is Lief Lipsiege (CE male human commoner), an accountant. He is chained to the heavy wooden desk and has no interest in the characters or their concerns. Under no circumstances does he voluntarily leave the room. Lief pulls the rope the instant he feels threatened.</p>

<p>Lief was pressed into service by Strahd many years ago. He keeps all the books for Strahd, recording the vampire&rsquo;s riches and conquests. Lief has been here longer than he can remember. He is grumpy because Strahd doesn&rsquo;t allow him to know about all his treasures. Even so, Lief has found out where one of Strahd&rsquo;s secret treasures lies. If he is treated with kindness, Lief will divulge the hiding place of the <wc-fetch type=item>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</wc-fetch>, as indicated by your card reading. Lief can draw a crude map showing a route to that location. His map is geographically accurate, but he admits that it doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge or avoid any dangers that might lie along the way. Lief doesn&rsquo;t necessarily know the most direct path to the symbol&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p>Lief knows that there&rsquo;s a key that unlocks all four chests, but he can&rsquo;t remember where he hid it. See &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below for more information.</p>
<p>The western door leads to <strong>area area K25</strong>. The eastern door provides access to a staircase (<strong>area area K21</strong>) that leads down to <strong>area area K9</strong> and up to a landing outside <strong>area area K35</strong>, continuing upward from there to <strong>area area K47</strong>.</p>

<p>The aromas of grease and well-oiled wood hit your nostrils as you pull open the door. This ten-by-twenty-foot room is filled with intricate machinery, except for small spaces between the stone gears and the iron chains and pulleys. On the other side of the machinery, to the south, is a rectangular shaft that rises up from the darkness and continues past this room. Attached to the west wall is a steel plate that has an iron lever protruding downward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the diagram below. The shaft (<strong>area area K31a</strong>) descends 90 feet from here to <strong>area area K61</strong>, and ascends 40 feet to <strong>area area K31b</strong>. Another 40 feet above that is a stone trapdoor in the ceiling that opens into <strong>area area K47</strong>.</p>
<p>Operating the machinery in this room raises a stone elevator compartment from the bottom of the shaft, lifting it past this room to the top of the shaft. See <strong>area area K61</strong> for more information on the elevator trap.</p>
<p>A character can spend 1 minute disabling the machinery in this room. The elevator trap won&rsquo;t function until the machinery is repaired.</p>
<p>The iron lever set into the western wall is normally in the &ldquo;down&rdquo; position. Moving it to the &ldquo;up&rdquo; position activates the trap and raises the elevator. Sliding it back down lowers the elevator and resets the trap.</p>
<p>When the elevator trap in <strong>area area K61</strong> is activated, all the chains, pulleys, and gears in this room move at once. It takes 10 seconds (1 round) for the elevator to reach the top of the shaft, and the machinery doesn&rsquo;t stop until the elevator completes its journey.</p>
<p>A secret door in the north wall is easy to spot from this side (no ability check required) and opens into <strong>area area K27</strong>.</p>

<p>Cold air fills this rectangular shaft, the walls of which are coated with mildew and worn smooth. Taut iron chains extend up and down the shaft. The links of the chains are thick and covered with grease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shaft is 170 feet tall. It starts at <strong>area area K61</strong>, climbs 90 feet to <strong>area area K31</strong>, another 40 feet to <strong>area area K31b</strong>, and another 40 feet to <strong>area area K47</strong>. When the elevator trap is activated (see <strong>area area K61</strong> for details), a stone elevator compartment measuring 10 feet on a side rises up the western half of the shaft. At the same time, a solid block of stone, also 10 feet on a side, descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. Both stone blocks have thick iron chains bolted to them, by which they are hoisted and lowered them as needed.</p>
<p>Scaling the shaft is impossible without the aid of magic or the use of a climber&rsquo;s kit, because the walls are smooth and slick with mildew, and the greasy iron chains are too thick and slippery to grasp.</p>
<p>Set into the roof of the shaft is a 5-foot-square stone trapdoor that can be pushed open to reveal <strong>area area K47</strong>.</p>

<p>Oil lamps illuminate this long, rectangular chamber with oak-paneled walls. Stained, yellowed lace hangs neatly from eight canopied beds. The figure of a woman moves lithely about the room, dusting furniture and humming quietly. Around her pale, slender neck is a gold necklace with a ruby pendant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The maid, Helga Ruvak, is a vampire spawn who claims to be the daughter of the village bootmaker, kidnapped and forced into service by Strahd. She pleads, on her hands and knees if necessary, to be saved from this awful place.</p>
<p>Helga will join the party if the characters ask her along. She intends to attack the characters but does so only if she senses an opportunity that doesn&rsquo;t involve having to fight the entire party. She also attacks if commanded to do so by Strahd.</p>
<p>Helga plays the part of the innocent damsel in distress to the last, revealing her ferocity only when she attacks. She is, in fact, the bootmaker&rsquo;s daughter she claims to be, but she chose a life of evil with Strahd.</p>

<p>Dirt-caked windows allow little light to enter this upstairs room. Broken bed frames and torn bits of mattress litter the floors. A tall, dusty wardrobe roughly shaped like a coffin, its black doors painted with fey creatures, stands between two cracked, full-length mirrors hanging on the south wall. A staircase descends along the north wall.</p>

<p>If someone opens the wardrobe, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A plain white dress yellowed with age flies out of the wardrobe and begins to dance in the middle of the room. The dress flaps around to the music of the storm.</p>

<p>If anyone touches the dancing dress, it collapses in a lifeless heap on the floor. Otherwise, it dances forever. Hanging in the wardrobe are a few rotted servant&rsquo;s uniforms, none of which are animate or valuable.</p>
<p>Set into the south wall, behind the hanging mirror west of the wardrobe, is a secret door. It can be pulled open to reveal a closet choked with dust and cobwebs and that contains a wooden ladder that leads up 20 feet to another secret door in the tower stairway (<strong>area area K20</strong>).</p>

Dining Hall of the Count</h3><blockquote>
<p>Dust assaults your lungs. A sweet yet pungent smell of decay fills this room, in the center of which stands a long oak table. A blanket of dust covers the tabletop and its fine china and silverware. In the center of the table, a large, tiered cake leans heavily to one side. The once white frosting has turned green with age. Cobwebs hang like dusty lace down every side of the cake. A single doll figure of a well-dressed woman adorns the crest of the cake. Suspended above is a web-shrouded chandelier of forged iron. An arched window in the south wall is draped with heavy curtains. Resting in a wooden stand by the window is a dusty lute, and standing quietly in the southwest corner is a tall harp shrouded in cobwebs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wedding cake is over four centuries old, kept in its current rotten state by the will of Strahd. The toy figure of the groom from the top of the cake was cast on the floor long ago. A character who searches the dusty floor finds the figurine with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>If the characters take the groom figurine out of the room, read the following if they return to the room at a later time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Billowing drapes draw your eye to the window, which has been broken outward. Scattered about the floor are chunks of the moldy cake, as if something had burst out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two explanations for the burst cake and broken window. Choose the one you think is creepier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strahd smashes the cake and breaks the window to make the characters think something terrible has escaped and is now stalking them.</li>
<li>Strahd&rsquo;s hate assumes a corporeal form, bursts out of the cake (the symbol of Sergei and Tatyana&rsquo;s love), and escapes through the window. &ldquo;Strahd&rsquo;s hate&rdquo; has the statistics of an invisible stalker and tries to kill whichever character is carrying the groom figurine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The room has wooden doors in the north and west walls, and an ornate steel door in the east wall (see <strong>area area K35</strong> for details).</p>
<p>The harp stands 6Â½ feet tall, weighs close to 300 pounds, and is fashioned of dark, stained wood carved with images of harts and roses. Its taut strings are made of gut.</p>
<p>A character who plays the harp and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Performance</wc-fetch>) check does well enough to summon the ghost of Pidlwick, a short little man dressed as a fool, with a tiny jingling bell at the end of his pointy dunce cap. He asks, &ldquo;Why have you summoned me from beyond the grave?&rdquo; Regardless of the answer, he commends the character for playing well and says, &ldquo;In my crypt below the castle, thou shalt find a treasure worthy of one so talented as thee! May it help thee set this troubled place to rest.&rdquo; If the characters think to ask him who he is, the fool replies, &ldquo;Pidlwick.&rdquo; If asked how he died, he replies humorlessly, &ldquo;I fell down the stairs.&rdquo; If Pidlwick II (see <strong>area area K59</strong>) is with the party, the ghost points at the clockwork effigy and says, &ldquo;He pushed me down the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With nothing more to add, the ghost of Pidlwick fades away and doesn&rsquo;t appear again. If the characters attack the ghost, it attacks them in turn.</p>

<p>A blazing hearth fire fills this room with rolling waves of red and amber light. The walls are lined with ancient books and tomes, their leather covers well oiled and preserved through careful use. All is in order here. The stone floor is concealed beneath a thick, luxurious rug. In the center of the room is a large, low table, waxed and polished to a mirrored finish. Even the poker in its stand next to the blazing fireplace is polished. Large, overstuffed divans and couches are arranged about the room. Two chairs of burgundy-colored wood with padded leather seats and back cushions face the hearth. A huge painting hangs over the mantelpiece in a heavy, gilded frame. The rolling firelight illuminates the carefully rendered portrait. It is an exact likeness of Ireena Kolyana.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chamber has several exits, including a large set of double doors in the west wall, a door at each end of the north wall, and a door to the south.</p>
<p>The painting above the fireplace depicts Tatyana, a beautiful young woman with auburn hair. Strahd commissioned the painting over four centuries ago to impress his beloved. The fact that Ireena Kolyana looks exactly like Tatyana is proof to Strahd that both women were born with the same soul.</p>
<p>The back wall of the fireplace contains a secret door, which is opened by lifting the poker from its stand. The fire must be extinguished in order for anyone to reach the secret door safely. Otherwise, a creature that enters the fireplace for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) fire damage and catches fire. Until someone takes an action to douse the flames on the creature, it takes 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. (This fire damage is cumulative with the damage from standing in the fireplace.)</p>

False Treasury</h3><blockquote>
<p>Resting on the floor of this smoke-filled room is a closed chest surrounded by piles of gold, silver, and copper coins. The fittings and clawed feet on the chest are evidence of great workmanship.</p>
<p>Attached to the east wall are two torch sconces. The southernmost one holds a torch with an intricate metal base. The other is empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor lies against the wall. The skeleton&rsquo;s right hand is on its throat, and its left hand holds the matching torch from the empty sconce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The coins scattered around the trapped chest total 50 gp, 100 sp, and 2,000 cp. The chest weighs 40 pounds and is unlocked. When opened, it releases a cloud of sleeping gas that fills the room. Any creature in the room must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>paralyzed</wc-fetch> for 4 hours. If all the characters succumb to the gas, they are found by the witches who lair in <strong>area area K56</strong> and dragged to <strong>area area K50</strong>, then left there unharmed. If even one character resists the effect of the gas, the witches do not appear.</p>
<p>The armored skeleton on the floor is all that remains of an adventurer. His corpse has nothing of value.</p>

<p>The secret door to the west is set into the back wall of the fireplace (<strong>area area K37</strong>) and can be pulled open from within this room by lifting a simple locking mechanism (which is connected to the poker in the study). It&rsquo;s possible that a character might open this secret door inadvertently by lifting the poker in <strong>area area K37</strong>. Characters can otherwise locate the secret door normally, but a successful check doesn&rsquo;t reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>
<p>The secret door at the northern end of the east wall is sealed shut. If the torch is taken from the skeleton&rsquo;s hand and placed back in the empty sconce, the secret door swings inward, revealing area K39 beyond. Removing the torch from its sconce at any time causes the secret door to close and lock shut, becoming sealed as before. Characters can locate this secret door normally, but a successful check doesn&rsquo;t reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>

<p>This ancient hall is choked with spider webs broken by a single clear path down its center.</p>

<p>The hall has an arched ceiling 20 feet overhead, hidden behind thick webbing. At the eastern end are a pair of arched bronze doors of ornate design. These doors can be pulled open to reveal area K40 beyond.</p>
<p>Most of the hall is full of giant spider webs (see &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in chapter 5, &ldquo;Adventure Environments,&rdquo; of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Characters who stray from the unobstructed path through the webs risk becoming stuck.</p>

<p>The secret door on the west wall can&rsquo;t be opened from this side, except by magic (such as a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell). See <strong>area area K38</strong> for more information on this secret door. If the characters pass through this door coming from <strong>area area K38</strong>, it closes and locks behind them if they don&rsquo;t take measures to prop it open.</p>
<p>A narrow secret door at the western end of the south wall is hidden behind a mass of webs. If these webs are cleared away, characters can search for the secret door, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.

Belfry</h3><blockquote>
<p>You can hear the rain and thunder outside, and the air here is cold and damp. Veils and curtains of webbing fill the room, making it hard to gauge its width and depth. A single, narrow path leads to the dark center of the room, where a rope dangles from high above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rope is attached to a great bell mounted in a wooden framework 50 feet overhead. Pulling the rope or attempting to climb it brings forth a loud, long &ldquo;GONG.&rdquo; That sound causes five Giant Spider to drop from their webs and attack. The spiders attack only if they are attacked or if the bell is sounded.</p>
<p>Most of the belfry is filled with giant spider webs (see &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in chapter 5, &ldquo;Adventure Environments,&rdquo; of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Characters who blunder into them risk becoming stuck.</p>
<p>At the west end of the north wall, behind thick webs, is a secret door that opens into area K41.</p>

<p>This octagonal vault is free of dust and cobwebs. The domed ceiling forty feet above is painted black and sparkles with a display of stars in unfamiliar constellations. Barely contained within this vault is a square tower, twenty feet on a side and thirty feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlemented roof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The domed ceiling is coated with dry pitch. The &ldquo;stars&rdquo; are shards of glowing crystal embedded in the pitch, each one as bright as a candle flame. Thanks to the starry &ldquo;night sky,&rdquo; the vault is dimly lit.</p>
<p>The plundered riches of Strahd&rsquo;s secret hoard lie within this adamantine tower, which is actually a <wc-fetch type=item>Daern&rsquo;s instant fortress</wc-fetch> (see chapter 7, &ldquo;Treasure,&rdquo; of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Only Strahd knows the command word to alter its shape and size, which can&rsquo;t be done until every bit of treasure inside it is removed. Only Strahd can open the two means of entry: a sealed adamantine door set into the base of the tower on the north side, and an adamantine trapdoor on the roof.</p>
<p>The arrow slits of the tower are 4 inches wide and 2 feet tall, and the walls of the fortress are 3 inches thick. Characters who are able to reduce their size or assume gaseous form can enter the tower through these slits.</p>

<p>Sweet smells waft from this delicately lit room. A great arched window along the west wall is covered by heavy red draperies, their golden tassels glinting in the light of three candelabras sitting atop small tables about the room. Tall white candles burn with bright, steady light.</p>
<p>A large bed, canopied by silk curtains, sits with its headboard against the north wall. Carved into the headboard with great skill is a large &ldquo;Z.&rdquo; Lying amid the velvet and satin sheets and bedclothes is a young woman in a nightgown. One of her dainty slippers has fallen to the floor at the bed&rsquo;s foot.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Arched double doors lead from this room to the south and east.</p>
<p>The window is divided into four tall panes of glass, each enclosed by a lead framework. The two outermost sections have small iron hinges built into them so that they can be opened, as well as iron latches to lock them in place when they&rsquo;re closed. The window looks out onto the parapet (<strong>area area K46</strong>).</p>
<p>The figure on the bed is Gertruda (NG female human commoner), the daughter of Mad Mary (see chapter 3, <strong>area area E3</strong>). Gertruda is oblivious to any danger to herselfâ€”especially from Strahd, who has <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> her. Sheltered by her mother, she was never allowed to leave home as a child. She finally slipped away and made her way to the castle, drawn by its majesty.</p>
<p>Gertruda is innocent, and years spent as a shut-in have twisted her sense of reality. Consequently, she maintains a fairy-tale view of life. When faced with a decision, she almost always makes the most simplistic choice. She is naive to the point of being a danger to herself and others. Fortunately for her, Strahd has not yet bitten her, though he intends to. (If he can do so while the characters look on helplessly, so much the better.)</p>
<p>Next to the bed, set into the north wall, is a secret door. It can be pushed open to reveal a dusty hall that ends at a similar secret door in the back of an alcove (see <strong>area area K45</strong> for details). Gertruda doesn&rsquo;t know that this secret door exists.</p>

She took her own life when Strahd began feeding on her, denying him the chance to turn her into a vampire spawn.</p>
<p>The blood in the tub isn&rsquo;t real, but rather a manifestation of Varushka&rsquo;s tormented spirit. If the blood is disturbed in any way, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A blood-drenched creature explodes out of the tub and attaches to the ceiling, cackling maniacally. Blood pours off its pale flesh, bony limbs, and stringy hair as it scuttles away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creature that erupts from the tub is no more real than the blood. It can&rsquo;t be harmed and doesn&rsquo;t attack. It scuttles across the ceiling, disappearing into area K44 through one of the archways. Once there, it disappears.</p>

Hall of Heroes</h3><blockquote>
<p>Dark alcoves line the walls of this long hall. The ceiling has fallen here, leaving rubble strewn across the floor. Overhead, the beams of Ravenloft&rsquo;s roof are exposed. Lightning from the dark clouds above sporadically illuminates the hall, lighting the faces of life-sized human statues in the alcoves. Each visage is frozen in terror.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ten statues that line this corridor depict ancient heroes. In actuality, the faces of the statues are stoic and expressionless, but whenever the lightning flashes, their expressions change to utter horror until the hall goes dark again.</p>
<p>The statues are imbued with the spirits of Strahd&rsquo;s ancestors, all of which grieve over the termination of their bloodline. Each spirit will answer one question if addressed directly. The spirits' answers are always short and vague, and there is a 20 percent chance that a spirit&rsquo;s answer is wrong.</p>
<p>The stairs at the west end of the hall descend 40 feet to <strong>area area K33</strong>. An open archway to the east reveals a tower landing beyond (part of <strong>area area K20</strong>).</p>

Parapets</h3><blockquote>
<p>You stand on a ten-foot-wide walkway that encircles most of the keep. The drizzle of rain continues, punctuated by the occasional clap of thunder or stroke of lightning. Far below these parapets are the shining wet cobblestones of the courtyard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The walkway runs around the front of the upper portion of the keep. Battlemented walkways extend from the keep north, south, and east to the outer walls of the castle as well. (See map 2 for the length and location of the castle walls.) All the windows leading from this area into the keep are shut and locked, but can easily be broken.</p>
<p>If the characters loiter on the parapets or atop the castle walls for more than 5 minutes, they encounter Strahd&rsquo;s animated armor (see appendix D) making the rounds. It patrols the parapets and the outer walls of Ravenloft day and night. Under a darkened sky, characters without <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> are more likely to hear the clatter of the armor approaching before they can see it.</p>
<p>The armor can&rsquo;t be salvaged if it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

Portrait of Strahd</h3><blockquote>
<p>You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.</p>
<p>An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet penetrating gaze.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/CoS/034-cos04-11.png alt=undefined class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>The ornate rug is actually a rug of smothering. It attacks creatures, other than undead, that move across it or anyone who tries to move it or otherwise disturb it. Underneath the rug is a bare stone floor.</p>
<p>The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on a side and as thick as the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring built into the side opposite the hinges. Pulling up on the ring opens the door. Below the trapdoor, characters see one of two things: either a 170-foot-deep shaft (<strong>area area K31a</strong>) or, if the elevator trap has been activated (see <strong>area area K61</strong>), a stone elevator compartment with a secret hatch in its top.</p>
<p>The portrait on the wall depicts Strahd von Zarovich before he became a vampire. Even in life, he was pale. The eyes of the portrait seem to watch and follow the characters as they explore the area. The picture frame is bolted to the wall and can&rsquo;t be removed without destroying it.</p>
<p>If the characters attack the rug or the picture, or if they attempt to remove either item, the guardian portrait (see appendix D) attacks.</p>

Lounge</h3><blockquote>
<p>As thunder shakes the tower, heavy beams groan under the weight of the ceiling. Three ornate lanterns hang by chains from these beams, each casting a dim glow. The curved west wall is fitted with three windows of leaded glass in steel latticework. A bookcase sits on the east wall between two doors. Plush, overstuffed chairs and couches are placed about the room. The fabric has faded with age, and the patterns it depicts are nearly gone. Lounging on one couch is a handsome young man whose attire, while elegant, is worn and faded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The youthful man on the couch is Escher, a dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in the past. Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and has retreated here until Strahd&rsquo;s mood improves. If attacked, he hurls himself out the window and lands like a cat on the roof of the keep (<strong>area area K53</strong>). He leads pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the lord of the castle happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span></p>
<p>In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of melancholy. Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the catacombs (<strong>area area K84</strong>) with Strahd&rsquo;s other castoff consorts.</p>
<p>The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn&rsquo;t allow for much of a view. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there&rsquo;s a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.</p>
<p>The books in the bookcase have no value and aren&rsquo;t much help to the characters. Some of the titles found on the bookshelf include <em>Embalming: The Lost Art</em>, <em>Life Among the Undead: Learning to Cope</em>, <em>Castle Building 101</em>, and <em>Goats of the Balinok Mountains</em>.</p>

<p>The cloak is ordinary. The witches in <strong>area area K56</strong> placed it here to help them remember which hook opens the secret trapdoor in the ceiling.</p>
<p>The trapdoor can be found after a search of the room and a successful DC 13 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Locating the trapdoor doesn&rsquo;t enable someone to discover its opening mechanism. The door has a hidden lock and can be opened by pulling down on the hook from which the black cloak hangs.

<p>The Barovian Witch (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>) that dwell in this area have sworn themselves to Strahd&rsquo;s service in exchange for arcane power. Seven witches are present when the characters arrive, minus any that might have been encountered and defeated in <strong>area area K50</strong>. If the witches are expecting the characters, they cast <wc-fetch type=spell>invisibility</wc-fetch> spells and stand quietly in the corners of the room, hoping that the cauldron draws their prey inside. Although they prefer to attack at range with their spells, they can grow magic claws using <wc-fetch type=spell>alter self</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>When the cauldron is touched by someone who also speaks the proper command word (&ldquo;Gorah!"), it magically heats any liquid placed inside it and remains hot for 3 hours, or until the command word is spoken again by someone within 5 feet of the cauldron. Once the cauldron&rsquo;s property has been used, the cauldron can&rsquo;t be activated again until the next dawn.</p>
<p>Captured witches will trade information in exchange for their lives and freedom, and can be forced to divulge the command word for activating and deactivating the cauldron. They also know how to open the trapdoor in <strong>area area K55</strong>.</p>

If Pidlwick II is spotted, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something lurks among the raftersâ€”a small, spindly man not much larger than a child. A flash of lightning illuminates his face, which is painted like a grinning jack-o'-lantern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although he appears to be a petite man wearing face paint and a fool&rsquo;s costume, Pidlwick II is actually a clockwork effigy of the real-life Pidlwick, who lies entombed in the catacombs. The dark paint on his face is soot.</p>
<p>If the characters see Pidlwick II in bright light, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that you&rsquo;re looking not at a small man, but a mockery of one. This thing is not a creature of flesh and bone, but a construct made of dyed leather stitched and tightly wrapped over an articulated frame. You hear the soft tumbling and clicking of gears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pidlwick II can&rsquo;t speak and doesn&rsquo;t have an expressive face, so he relies mostly on hand gestures and simple diagrams to communicate. He understands Common but can&rsquo;t read or write.</p>
<p>If the characters show kindness to the clockwork effigy, it accompanies them and tries its best to be helpful and entertaining. It knows its way around the castle and can serve as a silent guide.</p>
<p>If one or more characters are mean toward Pidlwick II, its quiet resentment of them grows, and at some point when the group is at the top of a staircase, it pushes one of the offending party members down the stairs. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or tumble to the bottom of the staircase, taking <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.</p>

<p>This hallway contains an elevator trap, triggered when at least 400 pounds of pressure is applied to the 10-foot-square section of floor in the center of the hall (marked T on the map), or when the lever in <strong>area area K31</strong> is raised. A party of adventurers moving in close formation down the hall is certainly heavy enough to trigger the trap.</p>
<p>A character who searches for traps while crossing the hall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check detects seams in the floor, walls, and ceiling that suggest that the middle section isn&rsquo;t attached to the rest of the hall. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check discerns that the trap can&rsquo;t be disarmed from this location.</p>
<p>The middle 10-foot section of the hall is a cleverly hidden elevator compartment, open to the north and south so that it appears to be part of the passageway. When the trap is sprung, two steel portcullises drop from the ceiling at lightning speed to seal off the compartment, trapping within those creatures that triggered the trap. An instant later, the closed-off elevator is propelled up the western half of a 20-foot-wide, 170-foot-tall shaft (<strong>area area K31a</strong>) to the sounds of turning gears and rattling chains. Magic sleep gas fills the compartment as it rises, and a creature trapped inside must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> as though affected by a <wc-fetch type=spell>sleep</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>At the same time the elevator rises, a 10-foot cube of granite suspended from heavy chains descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. The massive block lands gently at the bottom of the shaft, filling the previously open 10-foot-by-10-foot space adjacent to where the elevator stood. The block weighs thousands of tons and pulverizes anything in the space where it comes to rest.</p>
<p>Once the elevator starts rising, its portcullises are locked in place and can&rsquo;t be lifted. The walls of the shaft are nearly flush with the elevator compartment; only a few inches of space exist between the portcullises and the shaft walls.</p>
<p>All creatures trapped inside the elevator (including <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> ones) must roll initiative. The compartment takes 1 round to reach the top of the shaft, stopping just beneath <strong>area area K47</strong>. Each creature inside has one turn to act before the compartment comes to a dead stop. Their initiative rolls determine the order in which the occupants act. Conscious party members can take whatever actions they like. They might search for a way out, wake sleeping party members, cast spells, or take other actions. <wc-fetch type=condition>Unconscious</wc-fetch> ones can do nothing.</p>
<p>A character who uses an action to search the ceiling of the elevator finds a secret trapdoor with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. The trapdoor opens downward.</p>
<p>Any creature on top of the elevator when it reaches the top of the shaft must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed against the ceiling of the shaft. The character takes 44 (<wc-roll>8d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the elevator comes to a stop, its portcullises retract.</p>
<p>The elevator remains at the top of the shaft until the lever in <strong>area area K31</strong> is moved to the &ldquo;down&rdquo; position. When that happens, the trap resets in 1 round: the portcullises come down, and the elevator compartment descends to its place in the hallway at the bottom of the shaft as the stone block rises to the top of the shaft.

Servants' Hall</h3><blockquote>
<p>This hall stands in deadly silence. Heavy beams support a sagging, ten-foot-high ceiling. Fog clings to the floor, obscuring everything that lies less than three feet above it. A giant shadow lurches across the ceiling as a dark figure shuffles purposefully down the corridor toward you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure approaching is Cyrus Belview, a mongrelfolk (see <strong>area appendix D</strong>) and Strahd&rsquo;s faithful servant. He stands 4 feet, 9 inches tall but appears shorter because of his hunched posture. He has the Keen Hearing and Smell feature. The left side his face is covered with lizard scales, and he has the ears of a panther. His left foot looks like a duck&rsquo;s webbed foot, and his arms have patches of black dog fur.</p>
<p>The light in the hall comes from a lantern on the floor behind Cyrus. If the characters have their own light sources, Cyrus sees them, but he will not attack first. He wears a loop of twine around his neck, hanging from which is an iron key and a decorative wooden pendant fitted with a varnished human eyeball. The key unlocks the iron chest in <strong>area area K60</strong>. The wooden pendant is a <em>hag eye</em> given to Cyrus by the night hag Morgantha (see chapter 6), so that she could spy on Strahd. Cyrus doesn&rsquo;t know that the necklace is magical. See the &ldquo;Hag Covens&rdquo; sidebar in the hags entry in the Monster Manual for information about the <em>hag eye</em>.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Poor old Cyrus is obviously crazy. He has served the master for uncounted years and is devoted to him. Cyrus tries to get the characters to retire to their &ldquo;room in the tower&rdquo; (<strong>area area K49</strong>). If the characters aren&rsquo;t sure what room he is talking about, he offers to lead them there.</p>
<p>If the characters follow Cyrus, he tells them to stay close to him as he leads them through the south door to <strong>area area K61</strong> and deliberately sets off the elevator trap there. Cyrus tries his best not to succumb to the sleeping gas as the elevator compartment climbs the shaft (<strong>area area K31</strong>), and he has advantage on the saving throw. Assuming he&rsquo;s still conscious when the elevator compartment reaches the top of the shaft, Cyrus opens the trapdoor to <strong>area area K47</strong> and either leads the characters to <strong>area area K49</strong> or, if they&rsquo;re <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>, drags them there. After assuring characters who are conscious that &ldquo;the master will be along shortly,&rdquo; Cyrus then makes his way back downstairs to the kitchen (<strong>area area K65</strong>).</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t go to their room, Cyrus shakes his head and returns to the work of preparing his dinner in <strong>area area K65</strong>. If the characters take his key, he screams, &ldquo;The master will not be pleased!&rdquo; and begins to moan and slap his head, obviously upset. A successful DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check is enough to make him divulge the key&rsquo;s purpose, the location of the iron chest, and the chest&rsquo;s contents.</p>
<p>When he isn&rsquo;t being threatened, Cyrus giggles to himself from time to time for no clear reason. He also likes to tell poor jokes at the most inopportune moments.</p>
<p>Stairs at the east end of the north wall lead up to <strong>area area K23</strong>.</p>
<p>Along the east wall is a rusted but sturdy iron portcullis that bars the way to <strong>area area K63</strong>. (If the characters peer through the portcullis, read the boxed text for <strong>area area K63</strong>.) The portcullis bars are 1 inch thick and spaced 4 inches apart. The portcullis can be lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>
<p>The double doors at the west end of the hall are made of heavy planks banded with steel. They open into <strong>area area K67</strong>.</p>

<p>Arched frames of stone form a low, wet ceiling over this wine cellar. Great casks line the walls, their bands rusting and their contents long since spilled onto the floor. A few hungry rats make their home here, but upon your sudden arrival, they retreat to the shadows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rats are harmless. Cyrus Belview (see <strong>area area K62</strong>) treats them like pets.</p>
<p>Characters who search the room find a crack at the southern end of the west wall. The crack is half an inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to <strong>area area K18</strong>.</p>

<p>Dark stains cover the floor of this area. Large oak tables, scarred and beaten, lay scattered like toys about the room, their wood crushed and splintered. Replacing them are furnishings made entirely of human bones.</p>
<p>The walls and the twenty-foot-high vaulted ceiling are a sickly yellow color, not because of faded or timeworn plaster but because they are adorned with bones and skulls arranged in a morbidly decorative fashion, giving the room a cathedral-like quality. Four enormous mounds of bones occupy the corners of this ossuary, and garlands of skulls extend from these mounds to a chandelier of bones that hangs from the ceiling above a long table constructed of bones in the center of the room. Ten chairs made of bones and festooned with decorative skulls surround the table, resting atop which is an ornate, bowl-shaped vessel made of yet more bones.</p>
<p>The doors to the north and south are sheathed in bone, but the steel-banded double doors in the center of the east wall are not. Above these eastern doors is mounted the skull of a dragon.</p>

<p>Cyrus Belview (see <strong>area area K62</strong>) created this enormous work of art out of the bones of dead servants and slain adventurers. It has taken him many years to complete it.

<p>After Strahd was transformed into a vampire, several of the castle guards retreated to this room, but Strahd caught them and slaughtered them in a brutal show of violence.

<blockquote>
<p>The stairs descend into black, still water that fills an arched hallway before you. The water&rsquo;s surface is like dark, mirrored glass, disturbed only occasionally by the &ldquo;thwick&rdquo; of a drop falling from the ceiling. Twenty feet ahead, arched doorways lead downward from each side of the hallway. In each arched doorway, an iron door stands closed and partially submerged. You hear a weak cry for help from beyond the south door.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The water is 3 feet deep in the hallway and opaque. The steps on both sides of the hallway descend another 2 feet before ending at the iron doors to the north and south.</p>
<p>The floor beneath the water isn&rsquo;t as solid as one might expect. There is a safe path around several weight-sensitive trapdoors (see the Traps in Area K73 diagram), but the water makes it impossible to see where the trapdoors are. For every 10 pounds of weight on a trapdoor, there is a 5 percent chance that the trapdoor will open. The 10-foot-deep pit under each trapdoor contains a magic teleport trap that activates as soon as the trapdoor opens. Any Medium or smaller creature on a trapdoor when it opens plunges into the pit and is teleported to a cell in either <strong>area area K74</strong> or <strong>area K75</strong>, as the diagram indicates.</p>
<p>When a character sets off a trap, other characters in the hall see an explosion of air and water fly up around the triggering character (air that was trapped in the pit is released suddenly when the trapdoor opens). The triggering character suddenly falls from sight. An instant later, the trapdoor closes, leaving only a slowly dissipating swirl in the water. It doesn&rsquo;t open again until 24 hours have passed, at which point its teleport trap is recharged.</p>
<p>Characters who fall victim to the teleport traps are transported to dungeon cells closed with iron bars and under 5 feet of brackish water (<strong>area areas K74</strong> and <strong>area K75</strong>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. One of the cells is dimly lit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. Light spills out of <strong>area cell K74h</strong>.</p>
<p>A hinged door made up of 1-inch-thick rusted iron bars spaced 4 inches apart, with horizontal crossbars spaced 6 inches apart, closes off each cell. Each door is fitted with an iron lock. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 1 minute and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character is trying to pick the lock from inside the cell. If the check fails, the character can try again.</p>
<p>A character can force open a barred door by using an action and succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check.</p>
<p>Strahd visits the dungeon occasionally to see whether any characters have become trapped here. He can enter a cell by assuming mist form.</p>

<p>A strong young man clutches the bars of his cell while struggling to keep his teeth from chattering. His clothes are shredded, and he is soaked from head to toe.</p>

<p>The man is Emil Toranescu, a werewolf with 72 hit points. He claims to be a resident of Vallaki who was chased by dire wolves to the castle. He begs the characters to rescue him, offering to help them in exchange.</p>

<p>In truth, Strahd locked Emil here as punishment for causing a schism in his werewolf pack (see chapter 15). Anxious to prove his worth to Strahd, Emil rewards the characters for freeing him by attacking them when a good opportunity arises. Emil doesn&rsquo;t turn against the characters if they claim to be allies of his wife, Zuleika (see chapter 15, <strong>area area Z7</strong>). In that case, he tries to leave the castle and reunite with her, staying with the characters only until an opportunity to leave presents itself.</p>

Brazier Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>This room is thirty feet square, rising to a twenty-foot-tall flat ceiling. A stone brazier burns fiercely in the center of the room, but its tall white flame produces no heat. The rim of the brazier is carved with seven cup-shaped indentations spaced evenly around the circumference. Within each indentation is a spherical stone, twice the diameter of a human eyeball and made of a colored crystal. No two stones are the same color.</p>
<p>Overhead, a wood-framed hourglass as tall and wide as a dwarf hangs ten feet above the brazier, suspended from the ceiling by thick iron chains. All the sand is stuck in the upper portion of the hourglass, seemingly unable to run down into the bottom. Written in glowing script on the base of the hourglass is a verse in Common.</p>
<p>Two nine-foot-tall iron statues of knights on horseback, poised to charge with swords drawn, stand in deep alcoves facing each other. The brazier sits between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two statues are Iron Golem. Each horse and rider is considered one creature, and they are inseparable. The golems will not leave the room under any circumstances, and they attack only under specific conditions (see the &ldquo;Development&rdquo; section that follows).</p>
<p>The hourglass has AC 12, 20 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder damage. If the hourglass is reduced to 0 hit points, its glass shatters, causing the sand within it to fall to the floor. The magic writing on the base of the hourglass reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cast a stone into the fire:</em></p>
<p><em>Violet leads to the mountain spire</em></p>
<p><em>Orange to the castle&rsquo;s peak</em></p>
<p><em>Red if lore is what you seek</em></p>
<p><em>Green to where the coffins hide</em></p>
<p><em>Indigo to the master&rsquo;s bride</em></p>
<p><em>Blue to ancient magic&rsquo;s womb</em></p>
<p><em>Yellow to the master&rsquo;s tomb</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The brazier&rsquo;s flame is magical and sheds no warmth. A successful casting of <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 16) extinguishes the flame for 1 hour. The fire is permanently extinguished if the brazier is destroyed. The brazier has AC 17, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage.</p>
<p>The stones set into the brazier&rsquo;s rim are colored red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, respectively. Tossing one into the brazier causes its flame to change from white to the color of the stone, and the sand begins falling through the hourglass. Any creature that touches the colored flame is teleported to a location within Strahd&rsquo;s domain, as determined by the color:</p>

On the first round, the golems fill the room with their poison breath, which issues from the horses' mouths. (Each creature in the room must make two saving throws, one for each breath weapon.) On subsequent rounds, each golem makes one attack with its sword and one slam attack with its hoof. When there are no creatures left to fight in the room, the golems return to their alcoves, and the doors unlock. Forcing open a locked door requires a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. Each door has AC 15, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>

<p>This staircase of ancient stone is worn smooth. Thick dust covers its steps, and cobwebs choke the passage.</p>

<p>The stairs rise at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 40 feet horizontally, leading to a 10-foot-square landing (see below).

If the characters brush away the dust, someone can spot the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>The glyph triggers the first time a living creature passes over it. Triggering it activates a <wc-fetch type=spell>major image</wc-fetch> spell, conjuring an illusion of Strahd von Zarovich that appears either halfway up the stairs leading to <strong>area area K72</strong> or halfway down the stairs leading to <strong>area area K78</strong>, so that the vampire appears in front of the triggering character. When &ldquo;Strahd&rdquo; appears, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sickly mist fills the stairway ahead, then coalesces into the form of the vampire Strahd, his eyes burning red with anger. &ldquo;You have worn out your welcome,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Whatever gods you believe in cannot save you now!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have the characters roll initiative. Any attack or spell that hits &ldquo;Strahd&rdquo; passes through, revealing that he is an illusion. On initiative count 0, the illusory vampire chuckles and melts away like a wax doll in a bonfire, leaving no trace behind, and the glyph disappears.</p>

<p>Near the midpoint of the tunnel is a trapdoor hidden under a layer of fog. Characters can&rsquo;t spot the trapdoor passively, but an active search accompanied by a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check locates it. Unless the trapdoor is fastened shut with an iron spike or by some other means, it opens when 100 pounds of weight or more is placed on it. When the trapdoor opens, everyone who is standing on it slides into the marble chute below (<strong>area area K82</strong>). The trapdoor then resets.</p>

Catacombs</h3><blockquote>
<p>Buried deep beneath the keep of Ravenloft lie ancient catacombs, with arched ceilings supported by wide, hollow columns that double as crypts. Cobwebs hang limp in the musty air. A thick fog clings to the floor, which is covered in putrid waste. The black ceiling is moving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The catacombs fill an area roughly 110 feet east to west by 180 feet north to south, and the floor is covered in several inches of bat guano. The catacombs are made up of 10-foot-wide arched walkways running between 10-foot-square crypts, which serve as pillars that support the 20-foot-high ceiling. The area has five means of entry and exit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The door adjacent to <strong>area crypt 1</strong> (connecting with <strong>area area K81</strong>)</li>
<li>A barred archway to the north (connecting with <strong>area area K85</strong>)</li>
<li>A barred archway to the south (connecting with <strong>area area K86</strong> but warded by teleport traps)</li>
<li>A barred archway to the east (connecting with <strong>area area K87</strong>)</li>
<li>The high tower stair (<strong>area area K18</strong>) or the shaft (<strong>area area K18a</strong>) to the west</li>
</ul>
<p>Each crypt is sealed with a chiseled stone &ldquo;door&rdquo;â€”actually a tight-fitting stone slab measuring 3 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 3 inches thick. Removing or resetting a stone slab requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p>
<p>Each crypt houses the remains of the person or persons whose epitaph is inscribed on the front of the slab. The crypts are described in the following sections, their epitaphs noted under the crypt&rsquo;s number in italics.</p>
<p>Unless noted otherwise, each crypt contains a 3-foot-by-6-foot rectangular bier of marble, 3 feet high, with a skeleton draped in rags lying atop it.</p>
<p>The catacombs are home to tens of thousands of bats. The bats hang here during daytime hours and fly out in the evening through the high tower&rsquo;s central shaft (<strong>area area K18a</strong>) to hunt at night. They will not attack intruders unless they are provoked or are specifically commanded to do so by Strahd. If one or more bats within a 10-foot square on the map are attacked or caught in the area of a harmful spell, <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> Swarm of Bats form in that area and attack. No more swarms can be formed in that square until the next dawn, when more bats arrive to replenish those that were killed.</p>

The traps can&rsquo;t be perceived except with a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell, which reveals an aura of conjuration magic in the trapped areas. Although the traps can&rsquo;t be disarmed, a successful casting of <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 16) on a trap suppresses its magic for 1 minute, allowing characters to move safely through its area. A trap is also suppressed while wholly or partly in the area of an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>These teleport traps form a protective ring around the entrance to Strahd&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area area K86</strong>). Any creature that enters one of these 10-foot-square spaces is instantly teleported away, switching places with one of the Wight in <strong>area crypt 14</strong>.

He attached artificial wings to a harness and empowered the device with magic, but the apparatus still couldn&rsquo;t bear his weight, and he plunged from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to his death. His evil ghost attacks the characters on sight. If Ariel succeeds in possessing a character, his host climbs the high tower (<strong>area area K18</strong>) until it reaches the peak (<strong>area area K59</strong>), then hurls itself down the tower&rsquo;s central shaft (<strong>area area K18a</strong>), screaming, &ldquo;I can fly!&rdquo; the whole way down.</p>

<p>The stone door of this crypt lies on the floor, its inscription obscured by fog. The crypt gapes open. A skull, some bones, and a few bits of rusted armor lie atop a marble slab with a leering stone gargoyle squatting at each end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The epitaph on the door reads &ldquo;Endorovich (Endorovich the Terrible): What the blood of a hundred wars did not do, the spurn of a woman accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Endorovich was a ruthless soldier and self-aggrandizing noble who loved a woman named Marya, but she loved another man. As Marya and her lover were dining, Endorovich put poison into the man&rsquo;s wineglass. The glasses were mixed up, and Marya drank the poison instead. The lover was hanged for murdering Marya and buried at the Ivlis River crossroads (chapter 2, <strong>area area F</strong>). Endorovich never got over his guilt and, out of madness, killed many in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Endorovich&rsquo;s spirit is trapped inside one of the gargoyles. If anyone disturbs the bones on the slab, one of the Gargoyle awakens and attacks. If the gargoyle is reduced to 0 hit points, Endorovich&rsquo;s spirit moves to the second gargoyle, which then awakens and attacks. Both gargoyles have maximum hit points (77). Once the second gargoyle is destroyed, Endorovich&rsquo;s spirit is laid to rest.</p>

The wearer can become airborne by stepping or jumping off a high place, or by performing a high jump to take off from level ground. While aloft, the wearer gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, with the following limitations: except in a significant updraft, the wearer can&rsquo;t use the glider to gain altitude, and the glider descends 1 foot for every 10 feet of horizontal distance covered. At the end of the flight, the wearer lands on its feet and the glider is intact. If the wearer tries to accelerate the rate of descent, the glider breaks, and the wearer falls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A ten-foot-square shaft plunges into darkness. The sound of slowly dripping water echoes up the shaft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who have <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> or a sufficient light source can see that the shaft descends 40 feet to some kind of vault deep in the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Stones protrude from the shaft at regular intervals, offering handholds and footholds. The stones are slippery, however, so a character who tries to scale the wall without the aid of magic or the use of a climber&rsquo;s kit must make a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the bottom of the shaft is a dank vault with a ten-foot-high ceiling. The room is awkwardly shaped and smells of rotten meat. Fifteen stone coffins are scattered throughout the vault, all oriented with their heads pointed north. The floor is covered with human bones and rusty swords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a character teleports into a coffin from one of the <strong>area teleport traps</strong> that protect Strahd&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area area K86</strong>), read the following to that character&rsquo;s player:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A flash of light explodes around you, and then you are plunged into absolute darkness, suddenly lying in a confined space choked with dust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This vault contains fifteen Wight (one per coffin), minus any that have been teleported away (see &ldquo;Teleport Traps&rdquo; at the start of this section). Lifting a coffin&rsquo;s lid requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p>
<p>Each wight remains inactive until it is teleported away or until its coffin is opened, whereupon it attacks.</p>
<p>The bones and rusty swords cover the floor to a depth of 6 inches, and are the remains of servants who swore to avenge Stahbal Indi-Bhak&rsquo;s family. Whenever a wight is killed in this vault, some of the bones knit together, forming <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> animated human Skeleton. These skeletons attack intruders on sight but have no ranged attacks. There are enough bones and swords in the room for one hundred skeletons to form in this manner.</p>

<p>The spectral elf is a banshee that attacks the characters on sight, using her wail immediately. Once awakened, the banshee is free to roam Castle Ravenloft, but she can&rsquo;t travel more than 5 miles from this crypt.</p>
<p>In life, Patrina Velikovna was a dusk elf who, having learned a great deal about the black arts, was nearly a match for Strahd&rsquo;s powers. She felt a great bond with him and asked to solemnize that bond in a dark marriage. Drawn to her knowledge and power, Strahd consented, but before he could drain all life from Patrina, her own people stoned her to death in an act of mercy to thwart Strahd&rsquo;s plans. Strahd demanded, and got, Patrina&rsquo;s body. She then became the banshee trapped here.</p>
<p>Reducing the banshee to 0 hit points causes it to discorporate. Patrina&rsquo;s spirit can&rsquo;t rest, however, until she is formally wed to Strahd; the banshee re-forms in her crypt 24 hours later.

</blockquote>
<p>King Dostron was an ancient ruler of this land, long before the arrival of Strahd. He claimed descent from a duke of the Nine Hells, and his deeds did justice to this ancestry. His sarcophagus is made of beaten lead and encased in gold (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). Its lid can be pried open with a crowbar or similar tool, revealing nothing but dust within. The stuffed owlbear is a late addition to the crypt&rsquo;s decorâ€”a gift given to Strahd that wound up here. It looks almost alive but is harmless.</p>
<p>An <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> imp is perched atop the owlbear. If someone tries to open the sarcophagus, the imp says in Common, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I were you!&rdquo; The imp is magically bound to King Dostron&rsquo;s remains and must watch over them for several more centuries before its contract are fulfilled. It isn&rsquo;t obligated to protect the contents of the crypt (so it will not attack), and it delights in telling lies and engaging in mischief. For instance, it warns the characters that the sarcophagus is trapped, and that opening the lid will free a pit fiend bound within.</p>

<p>A creature of lawful good alignment that moves west to east through the curtain can do so without difficulty, but creatures of other alignments that do so are teleported back to the top of the stairs behind them. A Small creature can squeeze behind and around one of the bronze statues to circumvent the light curtain.</p>

Tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia</h3><blockquote>
<p>This tomb rests in hushed silence. Tall, stained glass windows dominate the eastern walls, allowing dim light to fall on two coffins resting atop white marble slabs. The one against the north wall is marked King Barov von Zarovich, and the one against the south wall is marked Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen. The vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead is inlaid with a beautiful gold mosaic.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The stained glass windows are so dirty on the outside as to be nearly opaque. The windows don&rsquo;t open, but they can be smashed easily. Anyone who looks upward through a window can see, 110 feet above, the castle&rsquo;s stone overlook (<strong>area area K6</strong>). Anyone who falls out a window here plummets almost 900 feet to the base of the Pillarstone of Ravenloft.</p>
<p>Prying the gold from the ceiling of this tomb would be a long and tedious effort for little reward.</p>
<p>The north coffin holds a beautifully sculpted, life-sized wax effigy of Strahd&rsquo;s father, King Barov. The old king&rsquo;s bones lie in a compartment beneath his effigy.</p>
<p>The south coffin holds the skeleton of Strahd&rsquo;s mother, Queen Ravenovia. (The magic that was meant to preserve her earthly remains failed years ago.) A tattered white shroud covers her bones.</p>
