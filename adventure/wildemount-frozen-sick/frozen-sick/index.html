<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Something is killing people in Palebank Village, and if the characters don&rsquo;t stop it, they might be next. &ldquo;Frozen Sick&rdquo; is an adventure that takes characters from 1st to 3rd level and introduces them to the continent&rsquo;s Biting North region—the bleak arctic realms of the Greying Wildlands and Eiselcross.</p>
<p>If your players are using the heroic chronicle to create their characters (see chapter 4), work with them to decide how they made their way to Palebank Village. Are they citizens of Uthodurn now aiding in the surface expansion of their civilization? Have they come north to seek freedom from the wars of other lands? Any number of options can help tie characters to this frigid region and the mysteries it holds.</p>

The dwarf brought home several items plundered from ruins on Foren, the largest of Eiselcross&rsquo;s islands. Among these treasures were two beautiful blue glass vials, which Urgon sold to an elf collector named Verla Pelc. The vials were then stolen, given to a fence out of Shadycreek Run, and sold again to an unsuspecting merchant.</p>
<p>In truth, the vials' beautiful blue color is the result of deadly blue spores that cling to the interior of the glass. Faint cracks in both the vials have exposed each person who handled them to frigid woe, a deadly disease that can&rsquo;t be cured by conventional means. The disease has already killed Urgon and Verla, turning them into ice statues. Details on frigid woe are found in the &ldquo;Eiselcross&rdquo; section of chapter 3.</p>

An explorer recently returned from Eiselcross, Urgon was afflicted by a strange malady that turned him into an ice statue, and which has since shown up in another of the village&rsquo;s residents. The characters investigate the mystery while contending with the forces of the Uttolots, one of the criminal families that control Shadycreek Run. More infected locals are discovered, including one more already dead, before the characters clear Uttolot thugs out of a local cavern complex called Croaker Cave. In the end, the vials of frigid woe are reclaimed, but merchant Irven Liel and his family are infected and will be the next to die without a cure. Moreover, the characters might well be infected with the disease themselves.</p>
<p>Elro asks the characters to travel to Eiselcross to seek a cure for frigid woe. The characters take a boat to Syrinlya, the Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, and retrace Urgon Wenth&rsquo;s path to the ruin of Salsvault. This magic laboratory was once a part of Aeor, an ancient flying city-state that crashed into Eiselcross during the Calamity. Only by braving Salsvault&rsquo;s defenses and deadly guardians can the adventurers find the antidote they need.</p>

Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snow gently falls from the sky and wind bites your cheeks as you stand in the graveyard of Palebank Village, a fishing outpost of Uthodurn that is home to several hundred dwarves and elves. The sun is low in the sky, sinking behind the fresh grave of Urgon Wenth, an old dwarf who caught a curse or disease that turned him into an ice statue. The folk of the village have gathered to pay their final respects to Urgon&rsquo;s frozen remains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of their characters' backstories, the players can decide whether any of them knew Urgon or whether they&rsquo;ve come to the funeral simply to show respect to the folk of the community. Either way, continue by reading the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A gruff voice speaks softly from behind you. &ldquo;Thank you for attending Urgon&rsquo;s service.&rdquo; You turn and meet the gaze of Elro Aldataur, a weathered elf, retired ranger, and the leader of the village. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to speak of dark tidings under such circumstances, but I believe that Palebank Village might be in danger, and I&rsquo;m hoping you can help us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether the characters are known in the village as neophyte adventurers or simply look the part, Elro (a neutral good, male wood elf veteran) hopes that they&rsquo;re the sort of people not afraid to step up to help folks in need. Use the following points to help guide the conversation as he explains his concerns to the characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two months ago, Urgon Wenth returned home after exploring Eiselcross for a year. He had been back for only for a few days when he came down with a strange affliction, which made the dwarf move slowly and caused blue veins to appear all over his body.</li>
<li>The village&rsquo;s priests of Moradin and Corellon used every spell they could muster to attempt to heal Urgon, but nothing they tried could stop the bizarre malady. Urgon battled the affliction for weeks, until his ever-slowing body eventually turned to ice.</li>
<li>Until yesterday, Elro and the rest of the community believed that Urgon&rsquo;s sad fate was an isolated incident, most likely caused by something the dwarf came into contact with while exploring Eiselcross. Then Elro noticed Tulgi Lutan, a dwarf trapper, showing signs of the same illness.</li>
<li>Alarmed, Elro tried to talk to Tulgi about it, but she pushed him away, asking that he let her die in peace.</li>
</ul>

He&rsquo;s worried that it could spread, but Tulgi refuses to talk to him, and the Glassblades in the village are better known for their combat skills than their ability to glean the truth in a complicated situation. Moreover, Tulgi is extremely distrustful of the authorities.</p>
<p>Elro thinks a group of adventurers might have better luck convincing Tulgi to talk. If the characters agree to help find the cause of Urgon and Tulgi&rsquo;s affliction, Elro offers to pay them 100 gp. He suggests that the characters start by searching Urgon&rsquo;s home or talking to Tulgi at her cabin.</p>

A good-natured Glassblade rookie named Mila Teno (a lawful good, female wood elf scout) stands guard outside the front door. If the characters explain why they&rsquo;ve come, she allows them to enter the house and look around. When the characters enter the cabin, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This cramped, dark cabin might have been a cozy place when its owner was alive. Now an unmade bed stands near a cold fireplace, its mantle hung with the head of some snarling white beast with gray horns. On the other side of the room, a small table strewn with dirty dishes and set with a dwarf-sized chair stands before two empty shelves whose contents are scattered across the floor: kitchen utensils, dried foodstuffs, adventuring gear, and a few books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who examines the mess in the cabin realizes that someone recently trashed the place while searching it. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check reveals the intruder&rsquo;s footprints. Tulgi Lutan was the culprit, desperate for any clues that might help her cure the frigid woe that is killing her. Her tracks lead outside and back to her cabin (see &ldquo;Tulgi&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; below).</p>

The items are listed as a dagger, a scroll case, a jade statuette, a quiver of twenty arrows, a silver ring set with a jasper, and two blue glass vials.</p>
<p>Characters who are residents of Palebank Village or have been there for a while know of Pelc&rsquo;s Curiosities—and also know that the shop was robbed and vandalized two months ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This snow-covered cabin looks peaceful and quiet from the outside. Its windows are shuttered, and a steady stream of smoke piping out of the chimney indicates a roaring fire within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tulgi Lutan&rsquo;s home is a one-story, one-room log cabin. Because she isn&rsquo;t keen on letting the characters in, the following features might be important:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roof of the cabin is 12 feet high. Climbing up the outside walls requires a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</li>
<li>The wooden door to the cabin is locked and has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The lock can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. Tulgi carries the key that unlocks the door.</li>
<li>Each of the cabin&rsquo;s four walls has one window, which is shuttered and latched from the inside. A window can be unlatched from outside with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.</li>
<li>The inside of the cabin is brightly lit by fires in a brazier and a fireplace, though the smoky haze given off by both makes the interior lightly obscured.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters knock on the door, Tulgi Lutan (a neutral evil, female mountain dwarf thug with a walking speed of 10 feet) calls from the other side, telling them to go away. A character who shouts back through the door and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check convinces Tulgi to open the door and allow the party inside. Otherwise, she ignores anything the characters say.</p>
<p>If the characters aren&rsquo;t invited inside, they&rsquo;ll have to decide what other means they&rsquo;re willing to use to enter. Regardless of how they do so, when the characters enter the cabin, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heat in this small cabin hits like a hammer blow. A table set with neatly stacked dishes, tools, and utensils stands at the center of the room. The smell of a simmering soup comes from a pot hanging inside a roaring fireplace. Another fire burns in an iron brazier at the opposite end of the room, filling the cabin with a smoky haze. Shivering at the end of a bed near the brazier is a dwarf wrapped in blankets. Bulging blue veins streak her face, neck, and hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters broke into the cabin, Tulgi attacks as soon as she sees them, fighting until reduced to 10 hit points, then surrendering. She has two pet Wolf, Iro and Jira, that hide beneath her bed. If a fight breaks out, the wolves join the fray to defend her.</p>

If the characters entered the cabin with her permission or if she surrenders to them, she tells them only that she has the same affliction that killed Urgon, and that she&rsquo;s looking for a cure.</p>
<p>A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check convinces Tulgi to reveal the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tulgi came to Palebank Village a few years back from Shadycreek Run with her sister, Hulil Lutan. Both work for the Uttolot family.</li>
<li>The Uttolots sent the sisters and a few others to the village to keep an eye on treasures coming back from Eiselcross—with the intent of stealing them. When such artifacts come through the small settlement, they are often unusual goods that treasure hunters are trying to keep away from Uthodurn or the Dwendalian Empire.</li>
<li>When Urgon Wenth returned to Palebank Village with treasures from Eiselcross, Tulgi saw her chance. She waited for Urgon to sell his finds to Pelc&rsquo;s Curiosities, then stole them all.</li>
<li>Tulgi gave most of Urgon&rsquo;s relics to Hulil, but kept one for herself—an ornate dagger. She grudgingly gives this weapon to the characters if asked (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). Hulil has the other items in a site north of the village known as Croaker Cave.</li>
<li>Tulgi was the one who searched Urgon&rsquo;s cabin, convinced that the dead dwarf must have had magic or other secrets stored away there.</li>

Verla keeps to herself, opening her shop only when the mood strikes her. She trades any and all objects that interest her, shipping them across Wildemount. Characters who are residents of Palebank Village or have been there for a while know of Pelc&rsquo;s Curiosities—and also know that the shop was robbed and vandalized two months ago. If the characters are recent arrivals to the village, anyone they ask about the shop mentions the robbery.</p>
<p>Pelc&rsquo;s Curiosities is a one-story, two-room log cabin. The windows are shuttered and locked from inside, leaving the interior dark. The only entrance is the front door, but characters can force open one of the shutters around the back with a successful DC 12 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check, granting access to Verla&rsquo;s quarters (see that section below).</p>
<p>When the characters approach the cabin, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dark cabin before you has a sign over its door which reads, &ldquo;Pelc&rsquo;s Curiosities,&rdquo; with the image of a curving dragon used to make the letter P. Though the shop appears closed, the front door is slightly ajar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character with a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 11 or higher hears whispered voices and footsteps coming from inside the cabin. If the characters succeed on a group DC 10 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check, they can surprise the bandits currently in the shop.</p>
<h4 id=front-shop-area>

When the characters can see into this area, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five cloaked elves appear to have ransacked the shop and are searching through the broken debris on the floor. The furniture, shelves, and front counter have been smashed, and the shop&rsquo;s wares now litter the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This area is difficult terrain thanks to the debris covering it. The five elves are Bandit with <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>, and immunity to magic that would put them to sleep.</p>
<p>The bandits attack as soon as they notice the characters, fighting until only one remains. That survivor then surrenders. If a captive bandit is questioned, a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check can learn the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bandits work for Hulil Lutan, a dwarf priestess of Tiamat. Hulil works for the Uttolot family of Shadycreek Run.</li>
<li>Hulil&rsquo;s sister, Tulgi, robbed Pelc&rsquo;s Curiosities two months ago.</li>
<li>Hulil is sick or cursed with some affliction that causes her to move slowly and is turning her veins blue.</li>
<li>Hulil ordered the bandits to trash Pelc&rsquo;s Curiosities in search of potions, scrolls, or other items that might help cure her. Despite their thorough search, the bandits found nothing useful. Hulil is hiding out with more bandits in Croaker Cave.</li>

When the characters gain access to this area, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What appears to be an ice statue of an elf is bundled beneath the blankets of a bed along the east wall of the room. A small table loaded with dirty teacups and a kettle stands next to the bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure in the bed is the unfortunate Verla Pelc, who was infected with frigid woe by Urgon Wenth&rsquo;s Aeorian relics. Her symptoms appeared a few weeks after the shop was robbed, but the reclusive elf never told anyone about them.</p>

If all the characters are new arrivals to the village, any of the villagers can tell them about the cave and how to get there.</p>
<p>Croaker Cave gets its name from its resident giant ice frogs. Its entrance is on the shores of the Frigid Depths, due north of Palebank Village. As the characters draw close to the cave entrance, they see frequent signs of tracks where bandits have been coming and going. However, there are no signs of patrols or guards. A plume of smoke rises from the ground beyond the cave entrance, venting through a narrow natural chimney from area C6. The chimney is too small to be climbed, however, and the main cave entrance is the only entry point.</p>
<p>Knowing that the residents of Palebank Village avoid the cave and its dangerous frogs, Hulil Lutan has made the place her base of operations. She and the Uttolot bandits she commands have domesticated the giant ice frogs that make the cave their home, using them as guard animals.</p>

<p>The blue-skinned frogs attack any creatures in the cave complex not escorted by bandits they recognize. Each fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check as an action convinces one frog to not attack or to stop attacking. If the character or any of their allies attacks or harms the frog, it resumes combat.</p>
<p>The frogs spend much of their time resting in pools of murky, frigid water in Croaker Cave. A character who succeeds on a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check opposed by a frog&rsquo;s Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check notices a frog hiding in a pool.

In addition, the dwarves have resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against poison; the elves have advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> and immunity to magic that would put them to sleep</p>
<p>Uttolot bandits attack any intruders on sight. Each fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees the caves.

<p>A warm rush of heat comes from a massive fire burning in the center of this cavern, its smoke venting up through a narrow stone chimney. The flames illuminate a rough painting of a five-headed dragon that dominates the north wall. A bedroll is spread out beneath the mural. Near the crackling blaze, a dwarf bundled in a heavy cloak sits on a stone chest beside an elf whose face is covered in dragon tattoos. The dwarf&rsquo;s face is streaked with pulsing blue veins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hulil Lutan (a neutral evil, female mountain dwarf cult fanatic with a walking speed of 15 feet, <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison) and her apprentice, Raegrin Mau (a neutral evil, male wood elf cultist with <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>, and immunity to magic that would put him to sleep), are both in a state of deep meditation, praying to Tiamat for a cure for the dwarf&rsquo;s affliction. Even if combat broke out in area C5, they remain unaware of the characters' presence until they are disturbed or attacked. Hulil and Raegrin are both greedy servants of Tiamat and the Uttolot family. Raegrin follows Hulil&rsquo;s every order with unshaking loyalty.</p>
<p>Hulil is so desperate for a cure for the ailment that is slowly killing her that she doesn&rsquo;t attack the characters when she first sees them, as long as she isn&rsquo;t attacked first. Instead, she orders them to stand down and demands to know why they came to the cave. A quick-thinking character can claim to have come to help Hulil (at the direction of her sister, after receiving a message from Tiamat, or with another appropriate rationale). With a successful Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check opposed by Hulil&rsquo;s Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check, the character convinces the dwarf that all the characters are her allies. On a failed check, or if the characters challenge her, Hulil and Raegrin attack.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hulil believes she has a disease called frigid woe. Though she doesn&rsquo;t know any more about the disease than its symptoms, she&rsquo;s heard rumors that explorers in Eiselcross sometimes succumb to it.</li>
<li>Hulil has guessed that her affliction was caused by one of the blue vials Tulgi stole from Pelc&rsquo;s Curiosities, originally sold by Urgon Wenth. The vial was cracked, revealing that its lovely color was the result of a dark blue dust clinging to the interior.</li>
<li>She is desperate to get to Shadycreek Run before the malady runs its course, hoping that she can trade the goods stolen by Tulgi for a cure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hulil used one of the vials to trap the chest containing the other stolen items (see &ldquo;Stone Chest&rdquo; below). Needing quick cash for the trip, she sold the other vial to Irven Liel, a human merchant staying at the Jolly Dwarf inn in Palebank Village while traveling with his family to Uthodurn.</p>

A character who examines the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check finds pin-sized openings in the dragon&rsquo;s mouth that contain a blue powder. The powder can be removed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A character who fails this check must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe (see the &ldquo;Eiselcross&rdquo; section of chapter 3).</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that the chest radiates an aura of evocation magic. When a creature touches the chest without speaking a prayer to Tiamat, a gust of wind escapes the dragon&rsquo;s mouth. If the blue powder is still in the dragon&rsquo;s mouth, it forms a cloud that fills a 15-foot cube in front of the chest. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe.</p>

When the characters enter the inn, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The downstairs of this inn features a large taproom. A gray-haired dwarf behind the bar greets you cheerfully as you enter. Two male humans and two tiefling children laugh among themselves as they enjoy a meal together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arl Bortock (a neutral good, male, mountain dwarf veteran) works behind the bar. If the characters ask for Irven Liel, the dwarf points them toward the laughing family.</p>
<p>Irven Liel, his husband Fenton Tethwick (both neutral good, male Dwendalian human Commoner), and their adopted daughters Honor and Magic (both tiefling noncombatants) are friendly and invite the characters to join them. Irven and Fenton are traveling booksellers. If asked about the vial, Irven explains that they met Hulil Lutan on the road to Palebank Village. She said she was moving and needed to shed some possessions, so she offered him a chance to buy the Aeorian relic at a great price. He plans to sell the item for a profit in Uthodurn.</p>
<p>If the characters tell Irven the truth about the vial, he panics, saying that everyone in his family has touched the object. Fenton gives the vial to the characters, handing it to them wrapped up in a cloth. Any character who touches the vial directly must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe.</p>

He pays them 100 gp as promised but asks the characters to stay in town. He is quite certain he&rsquo;ll have need of their services again soon.</p>
<p>The next morning, Elro comes to the characters with somber news. Irven, Fenton, Honor, and Magic are all afflicted with frigid woe. Seeing the blue powder in the vial has allowed Elro to consult old lore and learn a few things about the disease. (If the characters didn&rsquo;t learn the name of the affliction from Hulil, Elro is the source of that name as well.)</p>
<p>Elro knows that frigid woe is said to have only one cure—a milky liquid the Aeorians stored in gold vials. He hopes that the cure might be found in the same place Urgon found the vials of frigid woe in Eiselcross. The retired ranger asks the characters to travel to the islands of Eiselcross and retrace Urgon&rsquo;s path, hoping they can find the cure. He offers the party 200 gp for the task, and reminds them that time is of the essence for Irven and his family—not to mention for any characters infected with frigid woe. If the characters accept, Elro gives them a day to prepare and tells them to find him at the village docks when they&rsquo;re ready to set sail.</p>

<li>The characters will be taken to Syrinlya, an Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, Eiselcross&rsquo;s largest island. Once there, they should talk to a dwarf named Orvo Mustave, who has gone on numerous expeditions into the wilds of Eiselcross with Urgon Wenth.</li>
<li>Once the characters have found the cure, they should use whatever they need for themselves, then give the rest to an elf in Syrinlya who goes by the name &ldquo;the Buyer.&rdquo; They can tell the Buyer to teleport the cure to Elro in Palebank Village.</li>

<p>Morgo Delwur (a neutral good, female mountain dwarf werebear) has lived in Syrinlya for years. She can show the characters around and answer any questions they have about the settlement, providing any of the details found in chapter 3.

<li>Orvo and Urgon found the blue vials in Salsvault, an Aeorian ruin partially submerged in water in a region of Foren where the glacial ice is thin. Explorers call this region Thin Sheets.

<p>To whomever finds this:</p>
<p>All my people are dead: my family, my friends, and my workers. I, too, am dead. Were it not for my quick thinking and prowess with necromancy, our important work at Salsvault would be over. I continue to labor in my undead form, trying to find a sickness that can infect the gods themselves. If I have perished, I implore you to find my lab, find my notes, and finish my work.

<p>Six long stone tables are set with steel and glass laboratory equipment in this chamber, whose walls are lined with shelves holding all manner of strange knickknacks and tools. An armed humanoid with white skin and red eyes moves from table to table, adjusting bubbling mixtures and carefully adding reagents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The undead Ferol Sal has worked tirelessly in the laboratory for centuries, obsessed with crafting a disease that can kill the gods. Despite having made no progress in all that time, he keeps working. Ferol is a wight with an Intelligence of 16 (+3).</p>

<a href=#roleplaying-ferol class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Roleplaying Ferol</h4><p>Ferol knows nothing of Exandria&rsquo;s history since Aeor&rsquo;s crash, and his memory of the distant past is almost as hazy. His transformation into a wight and the centuries of solitude since have driven him quite mad. He cares only about taking revenge on the gods—who he incorrectly assumes are still active in Exandria. As a resident of Aeor, Ferol doesn&rsquo;t speak Common, though he can communicate in the archaic Draconic of Aeor, as well as an archaic form of Elven. Characters who speak Draconic or Elven can communicate with him, albeit slowly.</p>
<p>When Ferol notices the characters, he demands to know what they&rsquo;re doing in Salsvault. Any character who claims they have come to help Ferol with his work and succeeds on a Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check opposed by the wight&rsquo;s Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check earns the undead&rsquo;s trust. The check is made with advantage if characters who found and were able to read the note in area S10 mention Ferol&rsquo;s plans to craft a god-killing disease.</p>
<p>If Ferol trusts the characters, he tells them to stay away from the locked golem lab (area S16). If they ask about the cure for frigid woe, he tells them they can find it locked in a chest in what he calls the curative laboratory (area S18). A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check can convince Ferol to provide the key that safely unlocks the chest.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t earn Ferol&rsquo;s trust, the wight attacks, fighting until destroyed.</p>

<p>A cold wind howls through the collapsed east wall of this huge chamber, whose far side is completely submerged under frigid seawater. A dense bed of kelp grows up from the submerged floor, obscuring any sight of what lies below. Broken glass and the remains of shattered tables cover the floor in the dry section of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aeorian mages worked in this chamber to ensure that they could cure the diseases they created. Four Giant Crab now lair here, hiding beneath the kelp in the 5-foot-deep water and attacking any creatures that intrude. A character with a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 14 or higher notices the crabs, which attack with surprise if not spotted. See &ldquo;Salsvault Features,&rdquo; at the beginning of this section, for what happens if characters enter the frigid water.

After doing so, the elf pays out the 200 gp reward on behalf of Elro Aldataur.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t successfully recover the frigid woe antidote in time to save Irven and his family, all four family members succumb to the disease.

This might mark the beginning of a campaign in the Biting North. In particular, the Buyer suggests that the characters could easily find their fortunes exploring Eiselcross. Alternatively, their success in this mission might inspire the characters to seek out new realms and new adventures elsewhere in Wildemount.</p>
