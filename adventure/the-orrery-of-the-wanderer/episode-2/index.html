</p>
<p>In episode 2, Omin Dran sends the adventurers (now 2nd level) to Phandalin to learn the fate of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise that opened there a few months earlier but has recently gone dark. After overcoming hazards on the road, the characters enter the town. There, they learn that the franchise had signed an agreement to purchase the oft-ruined Tresendar Manor, a small estate on the outskirts of town. However, something catastrophic occurred at the manor recently, and no one in town has seen any of the occupants since.</p>
<p>While in Phandalin, the adventurers have the opportunity to interact with the townsfolk, possibly becoming involved in small-town dramasâ€”including a mayoral election. Those events could have a significant impact on the franchise the characters will establish at the end of this episode.</p>
<p>At the ruins of Tresendar Manor, the characters find clues about what caused the destruction. They locate one of the two surviving members of the previous franchise, the half-orc majordomo Gildha Duhn. Gildha provides details about the attack and the apparent goal of those who struck the manorâ€”retrieving a mysterious magic clockwork device that the characters recognize as part of the magic orrery found under Waterdeep. Investigating where the attackers slipped into the manor&rsquo;s basement and dungeon, the characters discover signs of recent rituals tapping into the power of the Far Realmâ€”and take on the monsters the attackers left behind.</p>
<p>After dealing with the threats in the dungeon, the characters run into operatives from Dran Enterprises who have been sent to take control of the site. With the imminent dangers in and around Phandalin neutralized, the characters are rewarded by Head Office with the license to take over the failed Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. From there, they are set to investigate who was behind the attack on Acq Inc, and what connection the mysterious orrery might have to this new threat.</p>

<a href=#layers-of-villainy class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Layers of Villainy</h2><p>Although the characters have no way to discover this fact at present, the attack on Tresendar Manor was carried out by operatives working for the Six. That dark cabal of dark individuals wants to bring dark forces into the worldâ€”and its members have a specific motive of wanting to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated in the process. However, most of the agents involved in the attack had no idea they were working for the Six. All were hired individually and clandestinely by one of its membersâ€”the goblin Splugoth the Returned, who made no mention of his identity or allegiance.</p>
<p>The appearance of Dran Enterprises at the end of this episode is meant very much to imply that the organization was involved in the attackâ€”and to distract the characters and the players alike from speculating on what other nefarious operators might be involved. The plots of the Six are revealed over the course of the adventure. More information on the Six, Splugoth, and Dran Enterprises can be found in &ldquo;Factions and Rivals&rdquo; in chapter 3, and in appendix B.</p>

Walking at a normal pace, it takes about 6 days to travel from Waterdeep to the head of the Triboar Trail, 1 day to hike along the Triboar Trail to the track to Phandalin, then another 4 hours to reach the town.</p>

If you want your campaign to move at a quick pace, run only these encounters. In doing so, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about random encounters and setting up details of the journey such as who keeps watch when the characters camp.</p>
<p>If you prefer to emphasize the dangerous nature of the adventuring life for lower-level characters, random encounters can be used to create additional tension along the road. As characters gain levels and access to diverse powers, random wilderness encounters become less of a threat, so this is a great point in the campaign to use random encounters to challenge the party.</p>
<p>When using the Random Encounter table below, roll once for travel during the day and once while the characters are resting at night. Or if you see an encounter that tickles your fancy, just run it.</p>

<p>Before diving headlong into the events of &ldquo;The Orrery of the Wanderer&rdquo; campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and the &ldquo;Volo&rsquo;s Waterdeep Enchiridion&rdquo; section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate downloadâ€”<strong><a href=http://www.dmsguild.com target=_blank rel=noopener>www.dmsguild.com<span class="align-baseline inline-block icon" aria-label="(opens in new window)" style=font-size:.8em;transform:translateY(-.15em);margin-left:.25em><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M19 19H5V5h7V3H5c-1.11.0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.89 2 2 2h14c1.1.0 2-.9 2-2v-7h-2v7zM14 3v2h3.59l-9.83 9.83 1.41 1.41L19 6.41V10h2V3h-7z"/></svg></span></a></strong>) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can make use of the following rumors that characters might hear on the streets or in the taverns of that great metropolis. Some of these rumors tie to the adventure, while the truth of others depends on your wishes for the campaign. Either way, feel free to use these rumors as inspiration for new encounters or side treks.</p>
<p>Omin Dran is one of the fabled Masked Lords of Waterdeep. His presence on the council is the impetus for beneficial changes sweeping across the city.</p>
<p>Omin Dran is definitely not one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. The addition to the council of such a power-hungry and ruthless individual would spell the end of the rule of law in the City of Splendors.</p>
<p>The earthquake that hit the city two days ago wasn&rsquo;t natural. Strong magic unleashed underground caused itâ€”maybe even magic from Undermountain.</p>
<p>Acquisitions Incorporated is making a play for control in the city, and the other power groups of Waterdeep are not going to let that happen without a fight. The recent hostilities between groups such as the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim have been made even worse by the increasing sway of the company.</p>
<p>A noble merchant in the South Ward survived an assassination attempt last night. A female half-elf was seen fleeing the scene, bearing a deep cut on her shoulder from a bodyguard&rsquo;s blade. A 50 gp bounty has been offered for bringing her in alive for questioning.</p>
<p>A killer is stalking the streets of the North Ward, murdering people in broad daylight. The victims' feet are chopped off, as if by a powerful blow with a sharp blade. Then they&rsquo;re decapitated. The heads are left behind, but the feet are taken!</p>
<p>The famous Waterdavian actor Tystanya Creed has not been seen since leaving the theatre after her last performance several days ago. Her adoring fans fear she is dead.</p>
<p>Towering forms in black cloaks have been seen around the City of the Dead at night. A number of witnesses swear that those cloaks and their deep hoods concealed skeletal forms.</p>
<p>A green dragon was spotted flying over the Sea of Swords just west of the city. The Blackstaff and her team are on high alert in case it ventures closer or harasses ships in the area.</p>
<p>One of the great walking statues of Waterdeep has been reported to be crying over the last three days. No one is sure about the cause of this watery discharge from the eyes, but some say it means the destruction of the City of Splendors is imminent! Others are certain it&rsquo;s a sign of great fortune on the horizon. Still others say it&rsquo;s just the humidity.</p>
<p>Members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters are going on strike, leaving the streets of Waterdeep dark and dangerous around the next new moon. The thieves and assassins of the city are already getting prepared for a night of carnage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This part of the High Road runs parallel to the Mere of Dead Men, a swamp full of dangers, pestilence, and death. Alongside the road, a lizardfolk is pleading with a male human dressed in black leather. Behind the dark figure, two bugbears stand with their morningstars drawn, staring at the lizardfolk with menace in their eyes.</p>
<p>The human shouts loudly enough for you to hear. &ldquo;Not acceptable! Friends, show this walking fish my displeasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lizardfolk starts to argue, saying, &ldquo;I am not a fish. I amâ€”&rdquo; But the bugbears interrupt with the hafts of their weapons, knocking the wind out of the lizardfolk and driving it to its knees. The poor creature catches sight of your party, looking at all of you with a pleading expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rasqel, a Zhentarim-backed merchant (NE male human bandit), entered into a business agreement with this female lizardfolk named Thetsis, who is a leader of her tribe. The two Bugbear, Jutt and Meff, act as Rasqel&rsquo;s muscle.</p>

If the characters fail to leave after this warning, Rasqel gives them an ultimatum: they can walk away or face the wrath of the Zhentarim.</p>
<p>A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check can tell that Rasqel seems unsure about the bite behind his threat. His little operation is off the books, with no sanction from his superiors in the Black Network. The bugbear bodyguards know this fact too, and because of it, they are less than enthusiastic about working for Rasqel.</p>

They obey reluctantly, but if it becomes clear that their lives are in danger at any point, or if the characters offer 10 gp or more to each of them, they walk away and leave their boss to his fate.

Forward-thinking adventurers can make a deal with Thetsis and her tribe that might help them corner the market on <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Water Breathing</wc-fetch>. The terms of the deal are up to you, but it&rsquo;s best to start small. Once per month, the lizardfolk can meet the adventurers or their agents to sell them algae. As the characters start to hire franchise staff at the end of this episode, this is a perfect opportunity to set up how staff members can conduct franchise business with no direct involvement from the charactersâ€”at least not to start.</p>
<p>These kinds of side ventures can easily expand to become adventures of their own. For example, one of the franchise NPCs handling the algae trade might fail to return from the Mere of Dead Men one day. The characters need to find out what happened if they want to keep employee morale from tankingâ€”and to keep the business relationship with the lizardfolk intact. Choices must be made and consequences faced, which are the hallmarks of a great campaign.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Franchise Tasks and Downtime&rdquo; section in chapter 2 has more information about working ongoing business activities into the franchise&rsquo;s campaign story.</p>

The bandit originally worked a fair deal with Thetsis and her lizardfolk tribe, whose members grow and harvest a nutrient-rich algae that is also a key ingredient for creating <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Water Breathing</wc-fetch>. After earning the tribe&rsquo;s trust, Rasqel altered the terms of the deal in stages, starting by offering less money in a &ldquo;slow market,&rdquo; then taking the algae with a promise to pay later, saying his cash flow was poor. When the lizardfolk began to balk at this arrangement, Rasqel threatened to send mercenaries to their home deep in the Mere of Dead Men, promising to destroy the tribe unless the lizardfolk worked for free. That threat was the cause of the altercation the characters witnessed.</p>
<p>The characters might easily recognize that this situation is a prime business opportunity. If not, suggest that realization to a character with a merchant-related background, or one who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>) or Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check. Thetsis carries algae that she&rsquo;s willing to sell for 50 gp, but which is worth 100 gp in Waterdeep. More importantly, any character with herbalist or alchemist experience realizes that the algae can be mixed with other reagents costing 150 gp to make a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of water breathing</wc-fetch>. Such a potion might fetch up to 500 gp in a city such as Waterdeep or Neverwinter.</p>

The High Road is frequently traveled by caravans, and so is better kept and easier to traverse. Triboar Trail, on the other hand, sees less frequent traffic and is less well maintained.</p>
<p>After a few hours' travel east, the adventurers come upon the following scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting cross-legged in the middle of the road is an odd-looking figure wearing not a stitch of clothing. In one hand, he fiddles with a copper medallion etched with the image of a thin, tangled pair of antlers. He might be a beardless dwarf, or a short and pale half-orc, or a human with a gland condition. Either way, he doesn&rsquo;t look up as he speaks in a voice that sounds like a goat choking on sawdust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune has strange and wonderful and terrible things in store for you. So I am here as fortune&rsquo;s lackey. Fair or foul? Weal or woe? Chant or howl? Friend or foe?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This unfortunate wanderer is named Carkuss (N male human priest). A character who has an appropriate background or who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check recognizes the copper medallion as a holy symbol of Beshaba. Known as the Lady of Misfortune, Beshaba is Tymora&rsquo;s twin sister and archenemy. This character knows that Beshaba sends her favored souls out into the world as a focus for bad luck and calamity, and that dealing with a favored soul of the Lady of Misfortune is a risky situation. Interacting with such agents in any way can draw Beshaba&rsquo;s ire, with potentially catastrophic consequences.</p>

To avoid the curse of Beshaba (see below), the characters must not harm Carkuss, they must not be overly kind to him, and they must correctly answer a riddle he asks. If successful on all three counts, each character earns a <wc-roll>d10</wc-roll>. Once before the character&rsquo;s next long rest, they can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. In addition, by earning Carkuss&rsquo;s favor, the characters might see him when they need good fortune later, if you so decide.</p>
<p>If the characters fail at any of these three tasks, one or more of them (at your determination) earns the curse. If the characters attack Carkuss, he doesn&rsquo;t defend himself, hoping that they slay his miserable form so his soul can be free.</p>
<h5 id=the-riddle>

<p><em>I stand aloof, alone as a savior</em>.</p>
<p><em>I shine my oily smile across the rippling vastness</em>.</p>
<p><em>I, with this beaming, attract and repel</em>.</p>
<p><em>Ignore me, and you are lost, one way or another</em>.</p>
<p><em>What am I</em>?</p>
<p>The answer is a lighthouseâ€”a foreshadowing on behalf of fate of where the characters will go in episode 3.</p>

She might target more than one character, especially anyone who worships Tymora. While under the curse, a character has disadvantage on saving throws. The subject knows the curse can be ended with <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> or similar magic, or it can be passed to another person.</p>
<p>To pass the curse, the victim can choose a living humanoid within 5 feet of it once per day, making a Charisma check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma check. If the cursed victim wins, the curse transfers to the new target. If unsuccessful in transferring the curse, the victim takes 5 (<wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll>) psychic damage. A target who resists the transfer is immune to the curse of Beshaba for one year. Passing the curse on to an innocent person is an evil act.</p>
<p>An NPC victim of the curse has a chance to die of a terminal case of bad luck. For each day that passes, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> and a <wc-roll>d12</wc-roll>. If both dice show a 1, the NPC dies in a freak accident. The curse is gone, but if word of the death reaches the character who transferred the curse, the consequences might live on.</p>

After an hour&rsquo;s travel, the characters come upon the following scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahead on the rough road, a pair of dead horses and an overturned cart block your way. Sacks and barrels spilled from the cart litter the ground. Trees grow close to the road here, and the thick undergrowth obscures the view beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the characters approach within 50 feet, any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices that several goblins stand motionless in the underbrush, while several more perch in the trees. A character who succeeds on the check by 5 or more also notices that these goblins are dead, as does any character who attacks or attempts to interact with them. A closer investigation then reveals that they have been propped up and tied into their positions.</p>

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check recognizes the sigil as part of a unique necromantic ritual that can turn any creature into an undead creature when it dies.

Map 2.1 shows the layout of the small town, with key locations described in the sections below.</p>
<p>Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This modest-sized town is comprised of some fifty buildings, most of which show signs of regular upkeep. Farms and an apple orchard mark the outer edge of town, with houses and shops closer in. Townsfolk are milling about in the central square and on the adjacent green. Two people stand on a stage on the green, addressing the crowd, but the distance to themâ€”along with a steady chorus of cheers, boos, and shoutsâ€”obscures what&rsquo;s being said.</p>
<p>Rising from a small hill overlooking the town is an old manor houseâ€”or at least it was an old manor house. Most of its walls have collapsed in what appears to be a recent disaster, with traces of smoke still rising from piles of tumbled stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters approach the stage or try to slip away, continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A portly, well-dressed male human on the stage points unexpectedly at your group and shouts. &ldquo;You see? This is exactly what I mean! Just when things start to calm down in Phandalin, more murderous vagrants show up. They probably have something to do with what&rsquo;s happened to Tresendar Manor, and with the livestock that have started going missing! And it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before this all ends in misery and bloodshed, I promise you!&rdquo;</p>

However, the recent abdication of one councilor and the town&rsquo;s growing size have prompted the townsfolk to decide that it&rsquo;s time to expand the council to five persons, and to incorporate a mayorship to handle increasingly important decisions about Phandalin&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Two people, both current councilors, are running for mayor. One is Harbin Wester, a male human with the integrity and unctuous personality of&mldr; well, a career politician. Wester is a former townmaster, and is running against Sildar Hallwinter, a male human, member of the Lords' Alliance, and former adventurer. Hallwinter is a circumspect sort who opposes Wester mostly because of the latter&rsquo;s corruption. For more information on both, see the &ldquo;<strong>area People of Phandalin</strong>&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>Wester is the town&rsquo;s banker and a major landowner, so some consider his wealth and power to be ample justification for his greedy, conniving nature. More importantly, a number of monstrous and magical incidents in the area over many years have left Phandalin&rsquo;s citizens anxious for strong-sounding leadership. Even though adventurers solved many of the town&rsquo;s problems in the past, Wester has gained much popularity by convincing people that the town&rsquo;s troubles would have never surfaced if those well-armed wandering busybodies hadn&rsquo;t gotten involved in the first place. The banker has even gone so far as to suggest that adventurers might have orchestrated some of Phandalin&rsquo;s past woes for their own gain.</p>
<p>Sildar Hallwinter isn&rsquo;t a great orator. He spends most of his time refuting Wester&rsquo;s &ldquo;unsubstantiated claims.&rdquo; The retired warrior also points out that Phandalin needs a leader who knows the dangers of the wilderness, even as its people need a mayor unburdened by scandal and potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>The characters can become involved in the mayoral debate if the players wish. If they don&rsquo;t, wrap it up and let the characters interact with the townsfolk as they see fit. Talking to any townsfolk yields up the information detailed in the &ldquo;Recent Events in Phandalin&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>area People of Phandalin</strong>&rdquo; sections, below.</p>

When that group arrived in town a few months ago, they spoke with Harbin Wester about acquiring the ruined Tresendar Manor, since the banker held the property&rsquo;s title. Wester worked out terms with Head Office and the deal was signed. The members of the franchise soon got to work on restoring the manor, frequently coming to town for supplies. When not slipping off to adventure for a few days here and there, most of their time was spent at the manor.</p>
<p>A number of days ago (the same day the franchise&rsquo;s payment was due to Head Office), the townsfolk heard explosions from the manor, with a few people reporting seeing gouts of flame and hearing the commotion of a battle. No one was really keen to investigate, wanting to avoid any trouble that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had brought on themselves. (Adventurers, right?) But after a few days passed and no one from the manor came into town, Sildar Hallwinter braved the walk up the hill to investigate.</p>
<p>Where the manor once stood, he found only rubble, scorch marks, ruined construction, and bloodstains. He failed to discover the single franchisee left alive in the manor, who was <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> at the time. The townsfolk have given the ruins a wide berth since then, not wanting to risk awakening whatever mad magic delivered the adventurers of the Golden Mongoose to their final fate.</p>

Quickly realizing the potential power in the component and the orrery it was a part of, they began to scour the Sword Coast for information regarding the artifact. A month ago, their intelligence-gathering resources turned up word that two Acquisitions Incorporated franchisesâ€”including the newly minted Phandalin franchiseâ€”had been scrutineering for lore about mysterious magic clockwork devices. Wanting to determine what Acquisitions Incorporated might know about the orrery, the leaders of the Six put a plan into motion. (The second franchise was based on the Sword Coast between Neverwinter and Luskan. Its fate will be discovered by the characters in episode 3.)</p>
<p>The Six set up an agent in Phandalinâ€”Ditch Fundi, who first raised and now runs Phandalin&rsquo;s new Temple of the Coin Maiden. Using Ditch&rsquo;s intelligence on the activities of the Company of the Golden Mongoose, the Six confirmed that the franchise held an orrery component called the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch>â€”and that Acq Inc head office was so far in the dark about their discovery. So the Six hired a number of agentsâ€”including archmage Hoobur Gran&rsquo;Shoopâ€”to attack both franchises.</p>
<p>Hoobur&rsquo;s forces snuck into Phandalin and razed Tresendar Manor to the ground. However, the Six operatives were unable to find the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch>. Knowing that one of the franchisees had teleported away from the fight, the agents assumed that the orrery component was gone. Unknown to them, the timepiece stayed behind, and remains in the possession of the survivor still buried alive in the rubble.</p>
<p>Only two of the townsfolk have any information regarding the attack on Tresendar Manor. Ditch Fundi, a charlatan priest of Waukeen and agent of the Six, was installed in Phandalin a month ago to watch the franchise&rsquo;s activities and set up the attack. At the same time, Sister Garaele of Tymora works for Dran Enterprises, and has previously fed much information on the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose to her bosses. She knows no details of the attack, assuming that the Golden Mongoose adventurers either blew themselves up or summoned a monster they couldn&rsquo;t control. But she knows that Dran Enterprises is sending a team to clean up the mess and claim the manor. For more on these two, see the &ldquo;People of Phandalin&rdquo; section.</p>

With the destruction of Tresendar Manor still the talk of the town, the characters have no problem finding people with opinions on the fate of the previous Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.</p>
<p>The information presented in the &ldquo;<strong>area Recent Events in Phandalin</strong>&rdquo; section can guide the NPCs' responses to the characters' questions. But beyond being sources of information, many of the NPCs in this episode have the potential to interact with the characters as allies, foes, or potential employees when their franchise comes together at the end of the episode. You should feel free to add your own NPCs as well, or change the ones provided to better fit the story you want to create with your players.</p>

Brawn came very late to the Redbrands' operation, and thus did only a little intimidation work with the locals before adventurers defeated the bandits and cleared their hideout in the dungeon of Tresendar Manor. He served a sentence on a work gang for his involvement with the bandits, but his affable personality won over many in town by the time of his release. He thus stayed on in Phandalin, where he works doing odd jobs and keeping a close eye on local goings-on.</p>

Characters who talk to him about his past can learn a few details of the entrance to the dungeons (see &ldquo;<strong>area Tresendar Manor</strong>&rdquo; below). If effective roleplaying or ability checks get the characters on Brawn&rsquo;s good side, he can be convinced to provide further details of the layout of dungeon areas 1 through 8. However, he knows nothing about what the Golden Mongoose adventurers (and the agents of the Six) might have done to alter the features of the dungeon as he remembers it.</p>
<p>Over and above his general utility in a fight, Brawn has a way with people, a winning smile, and a sharp tongue. If the characters look at him as a potential employee, he makes a good retainer for the franchise, picking up or dropping off goods, making deals, or entertaining potential partners. If he joins the franchise and the characters encourage him, you might eventually upgrade him to use the stat block of a spy.</p>

However, if she ever maneuvers them into a position where she can easily destroy them, she does so.</p>

He is the wealthiest citizen in Phandalin, owning much of the land, many of the businesses, and a good portion of the wealth in the local area. He was the last townmaster before that position was dissolved in favor of a three-person town council, and has been a member of that council from its inception to the present day.</p>
<p>Wester is friendly until it suits him to be otherwise, so most locals don&rsquo;t think ill of him. However, he is more than capable of stabbing people in the back while keeping a fake grin on his face. He is cunning in the ways of business, knowing exactly who to bribe or threaten to get what he wants, but he&rsquo;s careful to keep most dealings aboveboard and &ldquo;legal&rdquo; so that no one can claim to have been treated unfairly.</p>

Laughing off his claims as &ldquo;political rhetoric,&rdquo; he offers to buy drinks and asks to hear the group&rsquo;s stories.</p>
<p>Harbin Wester is intended to be a political adversary. He invites the characters to explore the manor if they desire, reminding them that he still owns the place. He also tries to get the best of the characters, offering money, land, goods, or services to place them in his debt. Once this is done, he calls in those debts whenever it&rsquo;s convenientâ€”and is not above asking the group to undertake morally questionable tasks as payment.</p>
<p>Wester never puts himself in a position where his foes can kill him without severe consequences. Several bodyguards (use the thug stat block) always watch over him. He also has extensive contacts and investments in Waterdeep and Neverwinter. With a message to either city, he can call in a large force of skilled mercenaries (Veteran) to his aid.</p>

<p>If the characters take Minghee into their employ, Linene is heartbroken at first, but she soon sees the value in having her daughter working for an up-and-coming franchise. Opportunities might arise for the franchise to enter into an ongoing business arrangement with the Lionshield Costerâ€”which might in turn raise the ire of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner&rsquo;s Exchange (see below) if the coster&rsquo;s success threatens Sharna&rsquo;s own plans for economic domination.</p>

She took over that position after the former overseer (and third member of the town council) Halia Thornton left Phandalin &ldquo;to seek other opportunities.&rdquo; All the locals know that continual problems at nearby mines made Halia&rsquo;s job difficult, with little to no wealth coming into the exchange for months at a time. Unfortunately for Halia, the downturn in the mining industry was the least of her worries. The Manshoon sect of the Zhentarim saw an opportunity in Phandalin and had Halia killed. Sharna (LE female dwarf bandit captain) is the sect&rsquo;s agent. She aims to revive mining in the area, with the goal of making Phandalin a haven for the rogue faction of the Zhentarim.</p>

She has the economic interests of Phandalin at heart, but only because she hopes to have a prosperous town at her mercy when the needs of the Zhentarim become her focus. She ingratiates herself to the characters, hiring them to clear out monsters in the local area that threaten mining interests. She offers to partner up on business deals, sharing the profits of the mines if the characters invest their time or money in such operations. If the characters end up on the wrong side of Harbin Wester, she sides with them against the banker, concealing her goal of usurping his wealth and power. She encourages the characters to actively oppose Westerâ€”or even to kill him if she thinks they might be amenable to the idea.</p>
<p>Sharna is a formidable combatant compared to most folk in Phandalin. She also keeps four bodyguards (Thug) on hand to guard the exchange, travel to the mines, rough up &ldquo;uncooperative&rdquo; people, or do the dark deeds she needs done to meet her objectives.</p>

Some years ago, he worked in the employ of the Rockseeker family, who had hoped to reopen mines in the hills and mountains surrounding Phandalin. After nearly being killed in a goblin ambush while traveling to Phandalin for the first time, Sildar&rsquo;s faith in himself was shaken. The Rockseeker family moved on after their troubled dealings in the town, but Sildar stuck around.</p>
<p>Although he is getting on in years, Sildar still trains with his weapons and keeps himself in shape. He was one of the town&rsquo;s three councilors prior to (as he puts it), &ldquo;Halia Thornton leaving without even saying goodbye.&rdquo; By running for mayor against Harbin Wester, Sildar hopes to help Phandalin increase its prosperityâ€”and to put that prosperity into everyone&rsquo;s pockets, not just Wester&rsquo;s. What he lacks in charisma, he makes up for in sincerity.</p>

As such, his goals are to bring stability and wealth to the region. He is brave and honest, but nearly losing his life years before caused him to doubt not only his martial skills but also his decision making. He could prove to be a valuable ally to the characters, especially if he&rsquo;s elected mayor. However, he might also frustrate them with his passivity and indecisivenessâ€”or allow them to take advantage of those same qualities to wield great influence over him.</p>

One of those levels is the business aspects of the characters' lives, with satire another obvious side of the campaign. But politics can be another driving force in an Acq Inc story, as can the satirical treatment of people in power.</p>
<p>The political maneuverings taking place in Phandalin will inevitably have an impact on the characters and their franchise. Still, if the players aren&rsquo;t interested in the political aspect of the campaign story, don&rsquo;t worry about it. Wester is elected mayor, the players can play nice with him to get what they want, and the story moves forward. But if the characters care about who becomes mayor, they have plenty of opportunity to influence the outcome.</p>
<p>Sildar Hallwinter cares about the good of the town but is wishy-washy. His lack of charisma hurts his chances for election. But a clever group of adventurers working behind the scenes might be just what Hallwinter needs to energize his campaign. On the other hand, Harbin Wester controls much of the wealth in Phandalin, including Tresendar Manor. As such, helping Wester get electedâ€”or at least not being too obvious about opposing himâ€”can put the characters on his good side. Even if Wester loses the election, his power and wealth mean that the characters will be interacting with himâ€”and dealing with his ability to make their lives easier or harderâ€”whether they want to or not.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that one of the characters could run for office as a last-minute wild-card candidate. A stranger wandering into Phandalin is unlikely to gain the trust of enough citizens to win the race, and the need to stick around town and run things will eventually get in the way of the characters venturing all over the North being heroic. But don&rsquo;t discount the narrative possibilities involved in the characters embracing the political side of the story even more wholeheartedly than you expect them to.</p>

Now, she is downright frenetic. She proselytizes for Tymora in the streets, in taverns, and in people&rsquo;s homes. Garaele is well known for haranguing the folk of Phandalin, claiming that the misfortune of previous years has been due to a lack of devotion to Tymora. Despite this, most locals like the priest, and are likely to help her if she&rsquo;s in trouble.</p>

Garaele is happy to pass this information along in exchange for Dran Enterprises' payments to the temple, and she asks no questions about that organization&rsquo;s long-term goals for the town.

She was one of the operatives used by the Six in the attack on Tresendar Manor, smashing her way through the site&rsquo;s walls. When the attack was over, the ogre wandered away. However, she decided to stick around the area to enjoy her proximity to lots of tasty livestock, even as she keeps her distance from anyone who might pester her.</p>
<p>In the days since the destruction of the manor, farmers and herders on the outskirts of Phandalin have reported seeing giant-sized footprints, both humanoid and canine, as well as missing animals. No one has spotted Stuuzant, as the ogre has good instincts for avoiding trouble. She keeps moving, hiding until the time is right to strike. When she attacks livestock, she does so when no one can see her, and she takes only what she needs to survive.</p>

Investigating the disappearances might be used to angle for something the characters want or need, such as supplies, a lower price on Tresendar Manor, citizens favoring one mayoral candidate over another, or whatever else you can think of.</p>
<p>Tracking down and defeating Stuuzant is no easy task, however. She is friends with a pair of Dire Wolf, and is mostly successful at covering her tracks after her raids. The ogre also has yet to establish a den in the area, so she rarely stays in one place for more than a day.</p>
<p>If the characters locate her, Stuuzant speaks Common quite well, uses smarter tactics than a typical ogre, and tries to bargain with the characters if it looks like they might defeat her. If questioned, she tells the story of being hired to attack the manor. A goblin in hooded robes paid her to help break into the estate and smash everything in sight. Stuuzant never saw the goblin&rsquo;s face, and knows nothing about the Six (which was never mentioned to her or any of the other hirelings).</p>
<p>Savvy characters might convince Stuuzant to take a position in their franchise, with the ogre making a great sentry or bodyguard. However, the townspeople might need assurances to accept such a creature living so close to their town.</p>

The smell of fruit is strong around the orchard year round, with the apples grown and picked here processed throughout the winter into juice, cider, and other products.</p>
<p>Daran Edermath (NG male elf scout) established the orchard many years before. A former adventurer and one of the oldest people in Phandalin, he remains aloof from town politics and focuses his interest on the traveling merchants and food-related businesses in Phandalin that buy his wares.

Most folk in town know that Bertice recently took up with a human miner named Grovet, who is also missing. If the characters met the couple on the road (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Random Encounters</strong>&rdquo; table earlier in this episode), they can allay at least some of Daran&rsquo;s fears for his daughter&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Earning Daran&rsquo;s full trust is a long-term proposition, and the characters must prove themselves beyond reproach in any dealings with the orchardist. If they do, however, the elf proves a valuable ally. He has more resources and power in town than his humble orchard might suggest. And as a member of the Order of the Gauntletâ€”an association of vigilant adventurers that seeks to overthrow evilâ€”Edermath has the ear of powerful people up and down the Sword Coast.</p>

Its weathered sign probably depicts a prone giant, but whatever paint or carvings once adorned the sign have been all but worn away. Inside, the place shows the same lack of care. It&rsquo;s dirty, ill kept, and in need of a thorough cleaning. Or burning.</p>
<p>The place is normally occupied by dwarf and human miners, either back from a stretch in the mines or waiting for a mine to reopen. They are not overtly hostile unless provoked, but it doesn&rsquo;t take much to provoke this unhappy lot. The owner and barkeep is Grista Kettlecopp (N female dwarf commoner). Surly to the point of rudeness, she tries to run her business her own way and stay out of the political and personal affairs of other townsfolk.</p>

If Sharna discovers that the characters are interfering with her and the Zhentarim&rsquo;s plans, she need only tell the miners that the characters are standing in the way of their gainful employment to inspire them to use their pickaxes for something other than mining. On the other hand, characters who earn the miners' good will can end up with numerous allies in Phandalin.</p>

This method means that the law is stable. Higher authorities can be consulted on matters requiring arbitration, with concrete edicts handed down to make the line between right and wrongâ€”in a civil sense, at leastâ€”crystal clear.</p>
<p>In Phandalin (as with many of the other locations in this adventure), the situation is not that simple. No king or council owns the lands of or around the town. Eminent domain is neither implied nor accepted. In most of the smaller settlements along the Sword Coast, the person with power is the individual who takes and holds that power. Locales still have authorities and laws, but the person who can kill everyone elseâ€”or pay someone to do soâ€”is the one who truly rules.</p>
<p>In Phandalin, Harbin Wester is that person. Even if he loses the mayoral election, his monetary resources far outstrip those of anyone else in the town, leaving him in a position of strong economic control. However, part of Wester&rsquo;s power derives from subtlety. He is wary enough to watch out for anyone with the ability to effectively oppose him, and savvy enough to make sure that such people never have any reason to oppose him. As such, when the characters clean out Tresendar Manor and attempt to use it as the base for their new franchise, a potential for social and economic conflict arises.</p>
<p>Wester holds the mortgage on the manor. The legal entity that was the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the signatory to that mortgage, and unfortunately for Acquisitions Incorporated, the mortgage is now in arrears. The characters can work a deal to take over those payments, but the terms are steep. Fortunately, after the manor is cleared, Head Office is willing to negotiate for the manor&rsquo;s deed. (See the &ldquo;<strong>area Conclusion</strong>&rdquo; section of this episode for more information.) This leaves Harbin Wester bitter, as he recognizes that having the favor of Acq Inc backing them up gives the characters more potential power in Phandalin than he likes.</p>
<p>As the rest of the campaign plays out, keep track of how Wester might try to take advantage of the characters and their deal. What if operatives of Dran Enterprises or representatives of the Six come to him? More importantly, if the characters directly oppose Wester and bring him low, what happens if a worse power steps in to take his place? The options are limitless. Do what challenges and entertains your players most!</p>

The orrery and its six components are presented in appendix D, and the powers of these relics are significant. But the fact that the orrery is an artifact in a some-assembly-required state gives you a lot of latitude in determining how you dole those powers out.</p>
<p>The orrery&rsquo;s components are set up so that their magic gets weird while the orrery is in pieces. At your determination, that magic might act in unpredictable ways, not recharge as often as normal, or add random effects to keep the characters on their toes. One aspect of this unpredictability comes into play in the adventure when the tiefling Talanatha uses the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch> to escape from the attack on Tresendar Manor, only to have the timepiece stay behind (see later on in this episode for details).</p>
<p>By making sure the characters understand the unpredictable nature of the components' magic, you give them good incentive to be cautious about using them. And if the power of the components threatens to derail parts of the adventure (for example, if the characters plan on using the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch> to teleport everywhere and find every secret location in the scenario), feel free to have the power of individual components mysteriously fail until they are all installed in the orrery housing once more.</p>

This was Splugoth, unconvinced by Hoobur Gran&rsquo;Shoop that the orrery component known to be held by the Golden Mongoose company is gone from the area; see the note in <strong>area area 12</strong> of the Tresendar Manor dungeons. Splugoth wanted creatures with keen scent to make another attempt at locating any franchise dead.</p>

If they search in the area where the jackals were digging, see &ldquo;Survivor&rdquo; below. If they explore the remains of the buildings on the grounds, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check reveals the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newly built wooden structures were struck by fire. Two of those still stand, but most have been burned or smashed to the ground.</li>
<li>The older masonry of the manor walls had been crumbling for some time. New stonework was replacing the old, but everything has been smashed to pieces.</li>
<li>Older humanoid remains were the source of the jackals' meal. However, no intact corpses can be found among the rubble.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the walls of the still-standing structures bear a mark in chalkâ€”a double-&ldquo;D&rdquo; insignia. This is the sigil of Dran Enterprises. As adventurers familiar with the operations of Acquisitions Incorporated, all the characters recognize the mark of Acq Inc&rsquo;s greatest rival organization. (The marks have been scribed by the archmage Hoobur Gran&rsquo;Shoop, who is charged by the Six with ensuring that Dran Enterprises takes the blame for the attack on the Acq Inc franchise at Phandalin. More on Hoobur will be revealed in episode 3.)</p>

Carefully pulling away the rocks reveals a half-orc buried under smashed and still-smoldering masonry. This is Gildha Duhn, majordomo of the Company of the Golden Mongoose franchise. She is starving, dehydrated, and addled. Gildha Duhn uses the acolyte stat block with these racial traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>When reduced to 0 hit points, she drops to 1 hit point instead (but can&rsquo;t do this again until she finishes a long rest).</li>
<li>She has <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet.</li>
<li>She speaks Common and Orc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gildha repeatedly mutters something in a low voice, but she has something in her mouth that makes it impossible to understand her. Oddly, that something is a complex clockwork device, which Gildha stuck in her mouth to keep out of enemy hands during the attack. If the device is removed, the characters hear her repeatedly say, &ldquo;They came for it&mldr; they came for the timepiece&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If given magical healing or allowed to sleep for an hour after being given food and water, Gildha regains her senses. She tells the characters that she worked for the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise in Phandalin, and that while working on their ongoing renovation of Tresendar Manor, the franchisees were attacked at night by unknown assailants. Gildha knows few details of the attack and heard little of the aftermath. Though she saw one of her group escape by teleporting away, she isn&rsquo;t sure what happened to the others. Falling rubble knocked her down, then buried her. Surviving on nothing but rainwater and her half-orc endurance, Gildha has been in and out of consciousness since the attack.</p>

<p>Gildha Duhn knows a little about the device, which she calls the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch>. The Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose found the relic six months ago in the possession of an evil adventuring band, who claimed to have taken it not long before from a tomb haunted by undead. After careful scrutineering and research, the Golden Mongoose adventurers learned that the timepiece had magical powers dedicated to navigation and teleportation, and speculated that it was just one piece of a larger and more potent magic device.</p>
<p>During the attack, Gildha saw one of the Golden Mongoose adventurersâ€”a female tiefling paladin occultant named Talanatha Three-Coinsâ€”activate the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch> and teleport away. For reasons unknown, the timepiece stayed behind (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Level Inappropriate</strong>&rdquo; sidebar). Gildha grabbed the relic, but has no idea where Talanatha went.</p>
<p>Gildha also tells the characters that she saw some of the attackers heading into a small cellar beneath the manor, consisting of storage areas and a spring-fed cistern. She knows that the manor features subterranean areas more extensive than the cellar, but the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had yet to do a thorough search of those areas. (As a result, Gildha doesn&rsquo;t know about the secret door that leads to the dungeon.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Orrery of the Wanderer&rdquo; makes use of an adventure trope as old as D&D itselfâ€”working up a totally high-powered artifact, then dropping it into the hands of low-level characters just to see what happens. The orrery and its six components are presented in appendix D, and the powers of these relics are significant. But the fact that the orrery is an artifact in a some-assembly-required state gives you a lot of latitude in determining how you dole those powers out.</p>
<p>The orrery&rsquo;s components are set up so that their magic gets weird while the orrery is in pieces. At your determination, that magic might act in unpredictable ways, not recharge as often as normal, or add random effects to keep the characters on their toes. One aspect of this unpredictability comes into play in the adventure when the tiefling Talanatha uses the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch> to escape from the attack on Tresendar Manor, only to have the timepiece stay behind (see later on in this episode for details).</p>
<p>By making sure the characters understand the unpredictable nature of the components' magic, you give them good incentive to be cautious about using them. And if the power of the components threatens to derail parts of the adventure (for example, if the characters plan on using the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch> to teleport everywhere and find every secret location in the scenario), feel free to have the power of individual components mysteriously fail until they are all installed in the orrery housing once more.</p>

A creature drinking this tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the disease. Symptoms strike when a victim starts a long rest or next becomes excited, as during combat. A victim suffers severe cramps, and their bowels make sounds like two ghouls fighting. When the symptoms first strike, the victim takes 5 (<wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll>) necrotic damage. In addition, a diseased victim regains no hit points or Hit Dice from nonmagical sources, including resting or spending Hit Dice. A victim who finishes a long rest can attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the victim shakes off the disease. Failure deals the character another 5 (<wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll>) necrotic damage.</p>
<p>A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch>) check can also remove the disease from another creature. Doing so requires the character making the check to care for the sick individual during a long rest. The caregiver gains no benefit from that rest.</p>

Moreover, if the characters fail to give the sisters food and water within 10 minutes, one of them dies. The surviving sibling then makes it her life&rsquo;s mission to seek revenge on everyone involved, including the adventurers who failed to act quickly enough to save her sister.</p>
<p>The Splintfig sisters sell rare herbs and spell components, and were visiting the manor to see if the franchisees wanted any of their wares. Their choice to stay the night turned out to be a textbook case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time when the Six&rsquo;s operatives attacked. The Splintfigs hid during the assault, but Drahkso Blaakberz, a dragonborn mercenary and part of the assault force, found them. Drahkso took pity on the sisters and refused to kill them, so his comrades locked him up with them.</p>
<p>The sisters talked to Drahkso a bit, and learned he was a mercenary hired to attack the manor. He mentioned that his employer was a short, hooded person who sounded like a goblin.

The corpses wear a wide range of clothing and armor, but have been stripped of all valuables and gear. Some are the fallen members and staff of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. Others are innocent bystanders the operatives of the Six came across as they moved toward the manor from the north. Still others are Six agents who died during the attack.</p>
<p>A character who has proficiency in <wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check when examining the corpses and sigils. With a success, the character discerns that the runes are connected to a ritual that could open a rift to the Far Realm. The dead humanoids were likely victims sacrificed to power the ritual. Something went wrong, though, and the victims were consumed before the ritual could be completed.

Sure enough, half a day later, the koboldâ€”named Patskyâ€”revives. Patsky is hungry, thirsty, scared, and used to being bullied. No matter how the characters treat him, he tells them that he was a servant to the attackers who assaulted the manor. Those attackers brought the living (at the time) cockatrices with them, but chose to leave them behind when they moved on. A spellcaster put a mark on them (the dragon-skull symbol), then ordered Patsky to lock the creatures in this room. They pecked him before he could escape, and have been repeating the process every time the kobold recovers. At some point, the cockatrices died and reanimated, but the kobold doesn&rsquo;t know how.</p>
<p>Patsky can also tell the characters the general story of the attack. He didn&rsquo;t fight much, since most of the other attackers were stronger, nor does he know who hired the attackers. Hoping to learn some magic, Patsky stuck close to the spellcaster, whose name he knows as Hoobur Gran&rsquo;Shoop.</p>

Dran Enterprises then dispatched a crew of hobgoblins to evaluate the area, clean up, and take control of Tresendar Manor as quickly as possible.

More importantly, after clearing the ruins and dungeon of Tresendar Manor, they are able to officially launch their own Acquisitions Incorporated franchise! The characters need to send a message to Omin Dran to report their findings. Not long after, Omin contacts them using magic, congratulating them on their success, telling them to rest up, and informing them that a representative of Acquisitions Incorporated will arrive soon to deliver paperwork and any other information a new franchise needs.</p>
<p>Sure enough, well-known Acquisitions Incorporated operative Viari (see appendix A) arrives the next day to deliver the documents and supplies, and to officially christen the new Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. He has each of the characters sign a contract crammed full of legalese and double-talk. Any character who reads the document and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check can decipher the jargon to learn the following, or Viari can explain the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Franchisees pay a monthly fee to Acquisitions Incorporated to maintain their franchise.</li>
<li>As part of that fee, Acquisitions Incorporated handles parts of the franchise&rsquo;s operations, including location procurement, staff management, and other benefits.</li>
<li>The monthly fee paid to Acquisitions Incorporated by a starter franchise covers the salaries of a majordomo, a skilled hireling, and two untrained hirelings. Franchisees must pay any hirelings employed beyond this number.</li>
<li>The franchise is licensed to operate in Phandalin and within 5 miles of the town, and is protected against interference in that area from other franchises.</li>
<li>Acquisitions Incorporated will deal with acquiring the rights to Tresendar Manor from Harbin Wester, as they did for the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Franchise Advancement&rdquo; in chapter 2 has detailed explanations of all these benefits and more.</p>
<p>One of the franchise&rsquo;s first hires might be right in front of them already. Gildha Duhn, former majordomo for the Company of the Golden Mongoose, is grieving her lost employers and anxious to put her life back together. With previous experience running a franchise (and no fault in that franchise&rsquo;s destruction), she makes an excellent choice for majordomo, and suggests that role for herself if the characters don&rsquo;t ask her. The remaining episodes in this adventure assume that the characters selected Gildha Duhn as their franchise&rsquo;s majordomo. If they chose another NPC to fill that role, simply adjust the text throughout the adventure accordingly.</p>
<p>With the contract signed, the ruins of Tresendar Manor become the franchise&rsquo;s starter headquarters! One of the benefits of Head Office negotiating with Harbin Wester for the lease to the manor is that the company can drive a much harder bargain than the characters would ever be able to strike. This beneficial deal might have hidden downsides, though, as the thin profit margins of the lease become a point of ongoing conflict between the characters and the corrupt banker.</p>

When they do so, Viari hands out any special position gear and instructs the characters in how best to fulfill their roles. Chapter 2 has more details on these positions, the benefits they confer, and what they mean to the franchise. Hopefully, the players have already considered what positions are the best fit for their characters and for the franchise as a whole, but if not, give them time. Make sure it&rsquo;s clear what each position entails and what franchise duties a character with a given position is expected to perform.</p>
<p>In addition to the characters' positions, the franchise majordomo can also select a company position if desired. This is especially useful if there&rsquo;s a key position that none of the players wants to take, or if the party size is small.</p>

Interesting NPCs might be revealed on a walkabout in the woods around Phandalin, or the characters might locate stands of prime timber or abandoned mines still holding valuable ore. Such resources can become part of the franchise&rsquo;s ongoing revenue stream.</p>
<p>Commercial connections forged with NPCs could also be formalized and refined. The lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men and the Splintfig sisters are just two of the potential business partnerships from this episode, whether the characters engage those NPCs themselves or allocate members of their brand-new staff for those tasks.</p>

Depending on how well the characters are getting along with Harbin Wester, the shady business practice activity might let them get more dirt on the banker, or gain his favor by going after some of his rivals.</p>
<p>Shady business practices might be an even bigger part of the characters' plans for their franchise. Any number of dodgy NPCs in town might be interested in partnering with characters who want to skirt the law. Smuggling ore without paying taxes, skimming from the coffers of either temple, running illegal gambling at the Sleeping Giantâ€”any of these activities could net a nice profit with relatively limited risk.</p>

A franchise could work to support the existing charity efforts of either of the local temples, or the characters could create their own fund for out-of-work miners. Doing so makes acquiring ongoing concessions or information from townsfolk much easier, but puts the characters in the bad graces of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner&rsquo;s Exchange.</p>

Based on what they&rsquo;ve learned during this episode, the characters are aware that the only other survivor of the attack on the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the tiefling paladin occultant Talanatha Three-Coins. Clearly the best source of information regarding the attack on the manor, Talanatha used the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch> to teleport away, but no one knows where she went.</p>
<p>Many of the locals had interactions with Talanatha in the three months that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was around Phandalin, and characters can use the schmoozing or carousing downtime activities to learn more about the tiefling. In particular, a number of the regulars at the Sleeping Giant remember drinking with Talanatha. She often grumbled about whether the Company of the Golden Mongoose was the best fit for her, and talked about a good friend named Wizzy who worked for another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. The details on Wizzy&rsquo;s franchise are vague, but Talanatha spoke of her friend having &ldquo;an awesome headquarters up the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Characters can also spend downtime investigating the <wc-fetch type=item>Orrery of the Wanderer</wc-fetch> and the <wc-fetch type=item>timepiece of travel</wc-fetch>, using either the scrutineering or research activities. In addition to revealing more details of the orrery as you see fit (see appendix D), such investigation could reveal that the last place the timepiece teleported someone to was a location on the Sea of Swords, north of Neverwinter but south of Luskan. Scrutineering or inquiries through Head Office turns up information on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise based in that areaâ€”the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, which has its headquarters in an old lighthouse along a stretch of coast known locally as Silent Sound.</p>
<p>Whatever clues the characters obtain regarding Talanatha&rsquo;s likely destination, have those hints play out over the full length of the downtime rather than rushing to advance to the next episode. The players should get used to how big a part downtime and franchise activities play in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.</p>
<h2 id=continuing-the-adventure>
<a href=#continuing-the-adventure class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Continuing the Adventure</h2><p>Before the next phase of the adventure, make sure the characters have their franchise and business affairs in order. They should know who their franchise employees are, giving those staff members detailed instructions about what to do while the characters are away. This sort of planning is a common theme in any Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so establish this precedent early.</p>
<p>Speculating that Talanatha Three-Coins might have fled to the Silent Sound lighthouse headquarters of another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, the characters might attempt to make contact with that franchise, either on their own or through Head Office. However, any such attempts yield no response. At some point, Omin Dran contacts the characters if they don&rsquo;t contact him first. He&rsquo;s worried about what the lack of contact with the Order of the Stout Half-Pint might mean, and he wants the characters to investigate.</p>
<p>The presence of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin is troubling for Ominâ€”especially if the Dran Enterprises hobgoblins were killed without the characters questioning them, leading to the assumption that the organization was behind the initial attack. If the characters aren&rsquo;t suitably intrigued by the orrery and its newly discovered component, that can be another thing that Omin charges them with investigating. Armed with a solid guess that Talanatha fled to the lighthouse, the characters prepare to head north!</p>
