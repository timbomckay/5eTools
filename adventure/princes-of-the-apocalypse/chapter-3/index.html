Characters are free to go wherever their information, as provided by you, takes them. Clues lead them to Haunted Keeps in the Sumber Hills. These old fortresses have become secret outposts for the cults of Elemental Evil.</p>

Two tendays ago, that changed when an important delegation from the city of Mirabar disappeared in the Sumber Hills.</p>
<p>The delegation traveled overland from Westbridge to Beliard, crossing the Stone Bridge. From Beliard it headed south into the Sumber Hills, bound for Summit Hall. Earth cultists attacked the group a few miles from Summit Hall. The cultists took prisoners back to the Sacred Stone Monastery, paying water cultists for the use of their riverboats to cross the Dessarin River, which is how the delegations valuables end up in Womford (see &ldquo;Rumors in Red Larch&rdquo;). On their way back to their base, the earth cultists skirmished with air cultists, which accounts for the &ldquo;Shallow Graves&rdquo; section later in this chapter.</p>
<p>After their arrival at the Sacred Stone Monastery, some of the delegation members were put to work in the mines. Others were sent down to the Temple of the Black Earth (see chapter 4).</p>
<p>Other troubles have also surfaced recently, including some that might directly affect the characters. Tailor the introduction to work with the factions, backgrounds, and motivations in play among the characters.</p>

<p>Red Larch is a little town on the Long Road, a few days travel north of Waterdeep and south of Yartar. Its a way station for caravans coming to or from the cities of the North, with only one inn, the Swinging Sword.</p>
<p>An important delegation from the city of Mirabar disappeared in the nearby Sumber Hills. The whole town is also abuzz with news and rumors of fierce raiders, roaming monsters, suspicious strangers, and unseasonable weather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The five factions know about the overdue delegation and are concerned enough to send agents to investigate. Characters affiliated with these factions are contacted and asked to help out. Tell each player in private why his or her faction is concerned about the missing delegation. The exact reasons for each faction are described as follows:</p>
<h4 id=harpers>

The diplomats are important, but each also carries one part of a secret, coded document that must be recovered at all costs.</p>

The mystery of a missing delegation might not seem to be directly connected to whatever personal goal the character brings to the adventure, but then again, it just could be the lead.</p>

Some of the Haunted Keeps are tougher than others. Feathergale Spire is designed for a 3rd-level party, Rivergard Keep works best for a 4th-level party, Sacred Stone is designed for a 5th-level party, and Scarlet Moon Hall should challenge a 6th-level party. Each outpost the characters overcome should advance them at least one level.</p>

Characters who take the time to talk to locals might gain a lead or learn something useful. The best places to hear the latest rumors about the missing delegation are the town tavern (the Helm at Highsun), the common room of the town inn (the Swinging Sword), or the store (Gaelkurs).</p>
<h4 id=rumors>

<ul>
<li>The Mirabar delegation was last seen in the town of Beliard. This information comes from a caravan guard in the Helm at Highsun and an itinerant priest of Lathander in the Swinging Sword who just came from Beliard.</li>
<li>A dozen beautiful old books written in Dwarvish showed up in the cargo of a shady keelboat skipper in Womford. Characters hear this fact from Endrith Vallivoe, a local shopkeeper drinking in the Swinging Sword, who bought one of the books from a merchant recently arrived from Womford.</li>
<li>Four new graves-simple rock cairns, really-have appeared on a windswept hilltop in the Sumber Hills, a few miles outside of town. The shepherd Larmon Greenboot found them, and he has no idea who would have been buried out there in the last few days. Larmon hangs around Gaelkurs. He can guide the characters to the site where he found the graves, but he insists on waiting until morning.</li>
<li>An Amnian merchant heading north on the Long Road stopped in Thorsk Thelorns workshop for a wagon repair. His goods were marked by a strange symbol, like a bowl. He paid Thorsk well and talked about a big gathering of druids he was heading to, hoping to sell kegs of beer and various trinkets. If the characters mention the Amnian merchant to Thorsk, they can get directions to Scarlet Moon Hall.</li>

<p>Some or all of the player characters might begin the adventure already in possession of useful information because of the adventure hooks in chapter 1. Key clues from these hooks include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Served Cold: The character hears from tavern patrons in Red Larch that a band of minstrels called the Windwyrds performs at Feathergale Spire. The character knows the spires location.</li>
<li>Dangerous Information: The character knows where the Reaver Ambush encounter takes place (see &ldquo;Cult Reprisals&rdquo; later in this chapter) and can go there to intervene.</li>
<li>Feathergale Rebel: The character knows the location of Feathergale Spire.</li>
<li>Madman at Haunted Keep: The character knows the location of Rivergard Keep.</li>
<li>Standing Offer or Strange Map: The character knows the location of the Sacred Stone Monastery.</li>
<li>Suspicious Fellow: The character knows the location of Feathergale Spire and heard that Thurl Merosska can be found there.</li>
<li>Undercover: The character knows the location of Rivergard Keep and that Jolliver Grimjaw is in charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone in Red Larch can provide good directions to Feathergale Spire if the characters ask about the place. Its a well-known site. Its fine if the characters decide to follow up on one of these leads instead of investigating the missing delegation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Orchards and large cattle ranches surround the little town of Beliard. Large stockyards lie on the east side of town, and stone warehouses along the Dessarin Road indicate the regular caravan traffic that passes through.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone is talking about the travelers from Mirabar and wondering what happened. A dozen theories make the rounds, but most make no sense. If the characters sort through the gossip look for those who spoke with the Mirabarrans, they unearth the following leads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neshor Fleurdin, proprietor of the Watchful Knight inn, spoke with the delegation leaders and learned they planned to head south on the Dessarin Road. They intended to visit Summit Hall next, returning the body of a knight slain in the North.</li>
<li>Senya, a server at the Watchful Knight, noticed a strange monk who wore a golden mask observing the Mirabarrans closely while they stayed at the Watchful Knight. The monk left a few hours before the delegation set out and hasnt been seen since.</li>
<li>A cattle drover met the delegation on the Dessarin Road about ten miles south of town, a few hours after they left. Later that day he saw a group of five warriors in sky-blue armor and white cloaks, flying on giant vultures. The aerial riders flew overhead and turned south, heading in the same direction as the delegation. Eann, a cattle drover drinking at the Watchful Knight, tells this tale to anyone who listens.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters ask about warriors on flying monsters or giant vultures, they gain an additional rumor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Halrud Ponden, the townmaster and chief lawkeeper of Beliard, looks nervous as he tells the characters about warriors in blue armor and white cloaks flying on monsters or giant vultures have been seen near Feathergale Spire, not far from Red Larch.</li>

No one else found it because its off the road. Only in the last day or two have natural scavengers returned to the area, since the lingering aura of elemental magic kept them away until now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dessarin Road leads south through the barren Sumber Hills. You don&rsquo;t meet any other travelers this day, but you find evidence that the trail supports traffic-wagon ruts and mule droppings prove that people come this way on a regular basis. You find nothing else until you are about fifteen miles south of Beliard, when you spot a cloud of ravens and vultures circling a mile or so west of the trail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters investigate, they find the remains of a pitched battle between the earth cult and the delegation from Mirabar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a small dell a mile off the road, you find the remains of a battle. A dozen dead soldiers lie on the ground, dressed in black surcoats bearing the emblem of a red axe. Most appear to have died from battle injuries, although some lie in small craters or jumbles of broken rock. Abandoned and looted wagons lie nearby. A couple of broken trunks sit on the ground by the wagons. Two rock cairns-one large and one small-stand atop a hillside nearby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters native to the North recognize the red axe design as the emblem of Mirabar. Non-native characters recognize it with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the craters and rock jumbles as the effects of powerful earth-based magic. None of the Mirabar delegates are here, but almost all of their escorts were killed.</p>
<p>The large cairn contains the bodies of five dead bugbears. They are dressed in black leather armor with a strange triangular symbol on it (the earth cult symbol). The small cairn contains the body of a human woman in monks robes, with a strange golden mask shaped like a snarling gargoyle face (a Sacred Stone monk killed in the fight). The mask is made of gilded tin and not particularly valuable.</p>

The characters might also stumble across the site while traveling in the Sumber Hills near Red Larch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a barren hilltop a few miles from Red Larch, you find four freshly dug shallow graves. The earth scraped out for the holes is piled nearby, although hastily gathered stones cover the graves. The faint smell of death hangs in the air, and several vultures circle overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Larmon is with the party, he explains that he grazes his sheep in a nearby vale, and he passed by this spot less than a month ago. There were no graves present on his previous visit. He found them just a couple of days ago and has no idea who might be buried here-none of the folk of Red Larch are missing, and he doesn&rsquo;t know of anyone else out this way. The hills are mostly uninhabited.</p>

All died from arrow wounds or crushing blows, and the earth cultists who won the battle buried the fallen on both sides because they believe everything should ultimately be consumed by the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have a good view of the surrounding hills from this vantage point. Several miles to the west you can make out the tiny outline of Red Larch, and the thin dark line marking the Long Road. Several miles to the north, you see a slender old tower circled by large birds. Nothing else is around here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If asked, Larmon identifies the tower in the distance as Feathergale Spire. All he knows about the place is that &ldquo;knights out of Waterdeep come up here sometimes, riding on flying monsters.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;They keep to themselves.&rdquo;</p>

(This is most likely if a character belonging to the Order of the Gauntlet insists on going directly to Summit Hall.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This small stronghold stands on a hilltop in the southern region of the Sumber Hills. It consists of a stone hall surrounded by a fifteen-foot wall with a sturdy wooden gate. Stables, a tower, barracks, and storage buildings are enclosed within the protective wall. A banner flying an emblem of a crossed torch and sword flutters overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summit Hall is home to about a dozen Knights of Samular, an order of long-suffering Tyr worshipers who have been reenergized by their gods return. They host another dozen young aspirants-in-training, and about fifteen servants and artisans to help maintain the place.</p>
<p>The most senior knight is a human woman of sixty years named Ushien Stormbanner, an ally of the Order of the Gauntlet. Ushien is happy to meet with any adventurers that turn up on her doorstep. She tells the characters that the delegates from Mirabar never showed up at Summit Hall, and that her warriors searched the area and didnt find them (both true).</p>

She can tell the characters that the masks are worn by the monks of the Sacred Stone order. She doesn&rsquo;t know much about them, but she can tell the characters that the monks have taken over one of the old Haunted Keeps. She provides directions to the Sacred Stone Monastery.</p>

<p>Womford is a tiny settlement on the banks of the Dessarin River, south of the Ironford Bridge. A dilapidated dock juts out into the river, and three keelboats are tied there. A large mill sits on the riverbank, with several big granaries nearby and a handful of small, run-down cottages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the townsfolk are intimidated by the thugs who run their criminal trade from their keelboats. Questions about, &ldquo;Is anybody selling books around here?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where do we find the river boats?&rdquo; quickly lead the party to the docks.</p>
<p>Two of the three keelboats are crewed by commoner (ordinary river sailors). The third belongs to a gang of water cultists: the genasi Shoalar Quanderil (see chapter 7), his servant Pike (a halfling thug), and two bandit loyal to the genasi. The cultists keelboat is 30 feet long. The middle 10 feet feature a small deck house, with a forecastle at one end and an open stern at the other. The holds are crammed with ordinary provisions, marked with the water cult symbol.</p>

If questioned, he denies any knowledge of books or delegates from Mirabar, but he is lying. Characters who present themselves as fellow rogues or potential recruits might be able to persuade him to admit that he &ldquo;ferried unsavory passengers across the river a couple of tendays ago, and how they paid was no worry of mine.&rdquo; Characters who threaten or act suspiciously trigger an attack from Shoalar and his crew.</p>

A trunk in the deckhouse contains five tomes written in Dwarvish (historical accounts of the old kingdom of Delzoun), each worth 30 gp.

Even if the characters destroy one of the Haunted Keep outposts completely and eliminate all possible witnesses, the elemental prophets gain glimpses of the threat facing them through dreams, visions, and portents. The Elder Elemental Eye warns the prophets of danger and impels them to respond.</p>
<p>You have four reprisals to choose from: &ldquo;Tremors,&rdquo; &ldquo;Skyriders,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reaver Ambush,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fiery Fangs.&rdquo; Let player interest and your own sense of pacing dictate which reprisal to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a character has the Dangerous Information adventure hook (see chapter 1), run &ldquo;Reaver Ambush&rdquo; when the character resolves to travel to the attack site and stop it.</li>
<li>Choose one reprisal to run after the characters visit the first locale (Beliard, Dessarin Road, Shallow Graves, Summit Hall, or Womford Rats). &ldquo;Skyriders&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reaver Ambush&rdquo; are good choices because they point to lower-level Haunted Keeps (Feathergale Spire and Rivergard Keep, respectively).</li>
<li>Choose a second reprisal to run after the characters visit the first of the Haunted Keeps. This is a good opportunity to point the characters toward the air or water keeps-whichever one the characters havent explored yet.</li>
<li>Choose a third reprisal to run after the characters visit the third of the Haunted Keeps.</li>

Use this reprisal any time the characters travel between towns or search the hills for sites of interest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are trudging along through the barren countryside when you hear a low, distant rumbling. A moment later, the ground beneath your feet begins shaking. The tremor is strong enough to start small slides of pebbles from the hillsides and cause shrubs and brush to wave from side to side, but then it subsides. A moment later, horrible insect-like creatures as big as horses begin to burrow out of the ground!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The insect-like monsters are two ankheg, hungry for flesh. The creatures havent specifically been sent by the earth cult to attack the characters, but the local evil influence of the cult makes events such as the tremor and the ankheg attack almost commonplace in the Dessarin Valley.</p>

The air cultists send a group of aerial raiders to eliminate the characters, or at least to give them a good scare. This encounter can occur any time the characters are away from a settlement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A strange, croaking cry from somewhere above catches your attention. You spot a trio of huge, winged shapes gliding toward you-giant vultures! Each bird carries on its back a warrior in dull blue armor with a dirty white cloak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attackers include one Feathergale knight and two howling hatred initiate (see chapter 7 for both), each mounted on a giant vulture. The riders prefer to keep their distance and make ranged attacks. They are also protective of their mounts. If a vulture is reduced to half its hit points or less, its rider disengages and retreats. If any two riders are killed or retreat, the third flees.</p>

They can find the villains camped just out of sight from the trail. Otherwise, the characters can encounter this camp any time they travel along one of the roads or trails in the area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A small, carefully banked cooking fire smolders in the middle of this haphazard encampment. Half a dozen battered old tents and crates of provisions are scattered around, along with racks on which pieces of smoked fish are curing. Several fierce-looking human warriors are hunkered down in front of their tents, tending to their gear or quietly conversing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The camp is occupied by one Crushing Wave priest, two crushing wave reaver, and five bandit (statistics for the priest and the reavers appear in chapter 7). If the characters have the advantage of foreknowledge and successfully sneak up on the villains, they can surprise the water cultists. Otherwise, the cultists assume that any strangers are enemies and attack. If all the Crushing Wave members are killed, surviving bandits try to flee or surrender.</p>

When Vanifer or her lieutenants receive word that a band of adventurers is trying to ferret out the cult, they send a pack of three hell hound after the party. The hounds need only get the scent of the characters through spilled blood or discarded items. This encounter can take place wherever the characters are at the time, whether traveling between sites or ostensibly safe at an inn.</p>
<p>If the characters encounter the hell hounds in the wilderness, the hounds appear a short distance behind the characters, following their tracks and baying with eagerness. If the characters are resting at an inn, they&rsquo;re interrupted by screaming and barking coming from the inns common room, where the pack breaks through windows and terrifies the staff. (Its all the better if the characters are eating a meal there themselves).</p>

<p>The monsters single-mindedly pursue the characters and fight until one is killed and a second is reduced to fewer than half its hit points, whereupon the surviving hounds flee. A mysterious bowl-like symbol (the symbol of the fire cult) marks the iron collars of the hell hounds. Thorsk Thelorn in Red Larch can connect the symbol to a mysterious gathering of druids in the Sumber Hills he heard about from a passing merchant and provide directions to Scarlet Moon Hall.</p>

During the day, azure sky encompasses the tower and gusty winds buffet it from all sides. The wind sighs through rock formations in the canyon. At night, the wind calms to a breeze, and light fog settles over the canyon. The spire then appears to float among the stars on a sea of clouds. The summits of the hills rise above the fog like islands in that sea.</p>
<p>You can initially describe the keep as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feathergale Spire rises from a pillar of rock high into the air, the tallest point for miles. Built from white limestone and embellished in marble, the spire resembles a gleaming sword that pierces the sky.</p>
<p>The gatehouse faces the opposite cliff, its drawbridge the only apparent point of entry. Tall, wide windows encompass the bottom level of the tower, absent only upon the gatehouse side.</p>
<p>A circle of open stalls rings the towers foundation where it meets the rock. Above each stall, the sculpture of a hippogriff in flight leaps from the towers base.</p>
<p>Beneath Feathergale Spire to the east, a wide gusty canyon yawns through the hills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two feathergale knight (see chapter 7) patrol the pinnacle (<strong>area S11</strong>) at all times, taking flight on giant vulture to meet attackers. One knight is stationed in the front hall (<strong>area S2</strong>) with two Howling Hatred initiates (see chapter 7). In daylight, the pinnacle knights have an excellent vantage point. They are likely to know of the characters approach long before the party arrives.</p>
<p>The knights reaction depends on how the party chooses to enter the spire. Peaceful visitors who approach openly are welcome. Those who sneak in or assault the spire meet the full defenses of the keep.</p>

<p>At the bells ring, a female human Feathergale knight (see chapter 7) named Savra Belabranta opens a small window near the gate, welcomes the characters, and courteously asks what brings them here.

<p>A circular landing surrounds the central shaft of a spiral staircase. The landing is piled with supplies and bales of straw. Radiating from the landing are twelve stalls with straw-covered floors. A harness, riding crop, and saddle hang in each stall. Swinging wooden doors cap either end of each stall, one leading from the tower to the stall and the other from the stall to the open air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The round room in the center of the spire serves as a storeroom. It is filled with supplies. Any gear from the Players Handbook you want the characters to have can be found here. The knights are willing to sell items at a ten percent markup.</p>
<p>When the characters arrive, four hippogriffs and two giant vultures occupy the stables, each in its own stall, and one Feathergale knight (see chapter 7) stands watch and tends the creatures. The hippogriffs and vultures are aggressive toward strangers that enter their stalls unless a knight introduces the newcomers. Knight disguises can fool the creatures, but only at a distance.</p>
<p>The latches on the stall doors are fastened at multiple points on each door, so it takes two actions to open each door.</p>

<p>The knights use the feast to learn about the characters and how much they know about the elemental cults. Applauding bravery and offering toasts, the knights listen to the characters stories and share anecdotes. When you decide its time, read the following:</p>

Once it is found, the manticore fights until it has no targets to attack, using its action every round to make three Tail Spike attacks. If there are no characters present, assume that one knight is injured and the manticores hit points are reduced by 8 at the end of each round of battle. A knight that is injured leaves the hunt. When no more knights remain, the knights are out of the hunt. If the manticore has nothing to attack, the battle ends and it flies off. Remaining groups can try to search for it again.</p>
<p>The manticore has twenty-four tail spikes. When it runs out of spikes, it does nothing other than fly away from its pursuers on its turn. At the end of each of these turns, have all characters and knights in the battle make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If all of their checks fail, the manticore gets away, though groups can try to search for it again.</p>

If they&rsquo;ve been polite, Thurl tells the characters the location of the Sacred Stone Monastery. He suspects the reclusive monks could be harboring evil and wants them investigated. If the characters have been rude or proven themselves to be enemies of all the elemental cults, the knights try to kill the characters later that night. Fighting all of the knights and cultists at once is a deadly encounter, but the villains aim to capture the characters first, and then hurl them from the top of the spire (<strong>area S11</strong>). The aarakocra in <strong>area V8</strong> come to the characters aid in that event.</p>
<p>If the characters defeat their attackers, surviving knights flee on hippogriffs and giant vultures. They lead pursuers past the griffon roost at <strong>area V7</strong>. Surviving cultists retreat to the Temple of Howling Hatred via Knifepoint Gully (<strong>area V3</strong>).</p>

Delighted with the characters deeds, Savra confides that the Feathergale Knights have a secret mission to master elemental air to annihilate Waterdeeps enemies. Savra offers to meet with Thurl to request he recruit the character into the Feathergale Knights. In doing so, she unwittingly reveals part of the knights secret.</p>
<p>Indoctrinated by the air cult, Savras heart and mind belong to Yan-C-Bin. If the characters defeat the cult and destroy Windvane, Savra is freed from princes influence and returns to her senses.</p>

Front Gate</h3><blockquote>
<p>The keeps main entrance features a two-story gatehouse attached to a round tower. Arrow slits look out onto the ground outside the gate. The gate itself is a double door of thick timbers reinforced by iron bands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gate is barred from the inside. It cant be forced open by any means short of a siege engine. The bar can be raised from inside the gatehouse passage (<strong>area K2</strong>) or lifted by an iron chain from the upper floor of the gatehouse (<strong>area K3</strong>).</p>
<p>One bandit stands watch on the wall section just north of the gatehouse. If he spots the party approaching, he warns the cultists in areas K2 and K3. If the characters openly approach the gate and call out, read the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clattering sounds and muffled voices come from inside the gatehouse. Then a human warrior appears at the second-story arrow slit directly over the gate. You cant see much of him, but he wears a leather jerkin and has a black beard. &ldquo;Who are you? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person at the arrow slit is Holger, a thug who commands the gatehouse. Holger is a high-strung martinet, and no one in the gatehouse likes him. Holger decides whether to open the gate, tell the characters to go away, or order his bandits to open fire. If Holger admits the characters, he orders four bandits (two from <strong>area K2</strong>, two from <strong>area K3</strong>) to meet them at the gate and escort them inside.</p>
<p>If fighting breaks out here, characters standing in front of the gate are exposed to fire from the arrow slit in <strong>area K3</strong> and the parapet on the wall. If the bandits in <strong>area K2</strong> cant line up shots at the intruders, they climb the stairs to <strong>area K3</strong> and then move out onto the parapet to join the battle.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This area serves as a barracks and a defensive post. Holger, a thug, commands the gatehouse. Three more bandit have bunks here.</p>
<p>The chain mechanisms are easy to operate. A character has to use three actions to bar or unbar the gate, or to raise or lower the portcullis. The bandits posted in this area operate the mechanisms to let people into or out of the castle.</p>

<p>The commoners are helpful, especially if they realize the characters plan to take on the Crushing Wave cultists. If they think the characters are cultists, the commoners hurry past with their eyes averted. All other groups challenge the characters if the party looks like it might not belong here.</p>

<p>Nine double bunks fill this barracks, each with a pair of footlockers tucked underneath. Doors exit to the north, west, and east.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This area is home to twelve bandit and four crushing wave reaver (see chapter 7). At any given time, four of the bandits stand watch as sentries on the outer wall, and two of the Crushing Wave reavers are on duty in <strong>area K16</strong>. The remaining eight bandit and two <strong>reavers</strong> linger here. They spend most of their time gambling, dozing in their bunks, tending to their gear, practicing in the yard just outside, or starting pointless quarrels with each other.</p>
<p>At night, most of these warriors are asleep in their bunks, but the cultists post a watch in this room throughout the night. At least two bandits remain awake and armed at all times. Sleeping cultists sleep through their first turn of any combat that takes place here, then awaken and arm themselves during their second turn.</p>

Water Tower</h3><blockquote>
<p>The upper floor of this tower looks deserted, but the ground floor is still in use. Curtains hanging across the eastern half of the room wall off someones private quarters, and several straw pallets lie on the floor near the door. A capstan stands against the north wall, with a heavy chain disappearing through a pipe to the northeast. The river laps just beneath the arrow slits of the tower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three crushing wave reaver and a fathomer named Reash (see chapter 7 for both) occupy this tower. Reash is in command and does most of the talking. He&rsquo;s a sour-faced fellow with a drooping mustache and an arrogant manner. Reash is instantly suspicious of strangers.</p>
<p>Reash uses the curtained area as his private quarters, while the reavers make do with the straw pallets. The fathomers private quarters hold a folding wooden cot and a saddlebag on a table (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>Capstan and Chain. The capstan raises or lowers the chain that blocks the castles water gate (<strong>area K11</strong>). It only takes one person to operate the capstan, but lowering the chain to allow a boat to pass requires a character to use three actions cranking.</p>

Landing</h3><blockquote>
<p>The keeps eastern wall juts out into the river, forming a good-sized basin in which a couple of keelboats float. A wide gap in the southeast wall provides access to the river, although it is blocked by a heavy chain. A twenty-foot tall bluff of rock and earth separates the landing and a nearby tower from the rest of the castle grounds. To the north, a wide stream flows out of a cave mouth into the boat basin. An iron grate blocks access to the stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keelboats full of loot and stolen goods off-load their cargo here. The boat tied up right next to the landing is currently empty. The water in the boat basin is about 15 feet deep, although it naturally shallows near the shore.</p>

Water Gate</h3><blockquote>
<p>The keeps eastern wall is built into the river, forming a long pier that encloses a boat basin. A heavy chain that emerges from the tower to the south stretches across the entrance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The heavy chain raised and lowered by the winch in <strong>area K9</strong> provides Rivergards defenders with the ability to block boats from entering or leaving. A swimming character can easily go over or under the chain-it impedes only boat traffic.</p>
<p>The sentry-a bandit posted on the wall section jutting out into the river-hails characters approaching by boat. He then shouts for Reash in <strong>area K9</strong>, who moves to the arrow slit in his tower to see whats happening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A male human with lank black hair looks out of the arrow slit in the tower by the river. He has a drooping mustache and a sour expression. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reash decides whether to admit the party. If he does, he has the reavers in <strong>area K9</strong> lower the chain and tells the characters to tie up their boat in <strong>area K10</strong>. He then sends the reavers to escort the characters.</p>

Moored Keelboat</h3><blockquote>
<p>A large keelboat is moored to the inner side of the keeps east wall, floating in the boat basin. A rope ladder leads from the top of the wall to the deck of the boat, about six feet below. Hatchways lead into the boats cabin from the bow and the stern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the Rivermaid. The ships <strong>water genasi captain</strong>, Shoalar Quanderil (see chapter 7) and a <strong>halfling</strong> servant named Pike (a thug) occupy the boats cabin. Two bandit serve as the rest of the crew. They remain in a cramped bunkroom below the deck on the bow, which is accessed by a hatch and a short ladder.</p>
<p>Shoalar is a high-ranking Crushing Wave cultist, and he is well informed about events in the towns throughout the area. Unless the characters come to Rivergard early in the campaign, he is likely to recognize them from accounts of their deeds. Use your best judgment.</p>
<p>If Shoalar recognizes the characters, he chooses one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>He plays dumb, invites the characters to drink and gamble, then signals his crew to launch a surprise attack.</li>
<li>He plays dumb, deflects the characters to the Hall of the Scarlet Moon, and sends a bandit to warn Jolliver Grimjaw.</li>
<li>He attacks immediately.</li>
<li>If the fight goes badly, Shoalar flees by leaping into the river.</li>
<li>If Shoalar Is Already Dead. If the characters already defeated Shoalar (see the &ldquo;Womford Rats&rdquo; section, earlier in this chapter), the genasi and his halfling servant aren&rsquo;t here. Instead, the master of the keelboat is a bandit captain.</li>

<p>Most nonhumans recruited by the cult are sent down to the Temple of the Crushing Wave (see chapter 4). However, Jolliver Grimjaw felt that he didnt have sufficient numbers to hold Rivergard against a determined attack, so he employs three bugbear to augment the garrison. The bugbears are bored and spoiling for a fight. They attack anyone they don&rsquo;t recognize, not caring if they injure or kill new recruits.</p>

Chapel</h3><blockquote>
<p>The keeps chapel contains plain wooden pews facing a large altar at the west end of the room. No idol hints at what deity is venerated here. A crude symbol is painted on the wall above the altar, resembling an X with a horizontal bar linking the bottom limbs. Several straw pallets lie near the chapel door.</p>

<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/PotA/Symbol-Cult-of-the-Crushing-Wave.jpg alt=undefined class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>The intendant of the chapel is Drosnin, a Crushing Wave priest. Two crushing wave reaver serve as her bodyguards and somewhat unwilling acolytes. (See chapter 7 for the cultists statistics.) They are enthusiastic converts to the cult, but they would rather be out raiding or fighting instead of stuck in the chapel listening to Drosnin rant about the unstoppable power of the Crushing Wave. The symbol painted above the altar is the symbol of the Crushing Wave cult.</p>
<p>Drosnin assumes that any strangers who wander into her chapel have been assigned to her for indoctrination. Drosnins favored technique is enthusiastic, relentless oratory. As long as the characters don&rsquo;t attack, she launches into an exhaustive sermon about the &ldquo;truth of the deep waters&rdquo; and the &ldquo;great revelations&rdquo; to come. The two reavers with her roll their eyes and look bored, but Drosnin keeps going and going, brooking no interruptions. Once Drosnin begins, she drones on for two hours before dismissing the party. If they attempt to leave before she finishes her sermon, or if they interrupt her frequently, she orders the reavers to keep them from leaving. She attacks if the characters ignore her commands.</p>

Great Hall</h3><p>The great hall becomes a banquet hall, a practice hall, or a throne room as the occasion requires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room is the great hall of the keep. It is two stories high, with stone stairs on both sides of the room leading up to a stone balcony at the west end of the chamber. Heavy double doors lead east to the castle yard, while two interior doors open to the west. Arrow slits look out to the north and the south.</p>
<p>At the west end of the room, below the balcony, a large wooden chair sits behind a wide table littered with papers and discarded plates. A second table, this one long and furnished with benches, runs down the middle of the hall. The walls are painted in green and blue, decorated with tattered banners showing nautical designs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jolliver Grimjaw conducts most of his business here. He is a wereboar, although he remains in his human form during any audience with strangers to Rivergard. Grimjaw usually remains in the hall until late in the evening, when he slips down to the riverside to hunt in boar form. He returns before dawn and sleeps in his quarters (<strong>area K21</strong>). In the Great Hall, he is attended by a fathomer named Urshnora and two crushing wave reaver (see chapter 7 for both). If a battle breaks out, Grimjaw prefers to fight in his hybrid form. If the battle goes poorly, he flees through the secret door (see &ldquo;Secret Door&rdquo; below).</p>

Various reports from gangs of bandits and smugglers throughout the area are buried in the piles of paper on the table, along with routine notes about Rivergards supplies, boat sailings on the river, and logbooks and manifests taken from plundered ships. The bandits report exactly what loot they take, but location descriptions are imprecise: for example, &ldquo;wagonload of flour, near B.,&rdquo; or &ldquo;40 silver pieces, traveler near W.&rdquo; The abbreviations stand for towns in the area, Beliard and Womford.</p>
<p>One of these reports details caravan traffic in Red Larch. It makes note of the arrival of &ldquo;a band of troublemakers&rdquo; with the racial mix of the party. The letter is unsigned, but the unusual handwriting mixes block letters and script. See &ldquo;The Spys Letter&rdquo; in chapter 4 if the characters investigate further.</p>

He asks very direct questions, such as &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; If a character tries to flatter him or concoct any kind of fanciful story, Grimjaw tells the talkative character to shut up and points at someone else to answer.</p>
<p>After listening to the characters, Grimjaw decides among the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the party seems unaware of the cult and annoys him, he has the characters thrown out of Rivergard.</li>
<li>If the party seems unaware of the cult but offers a good reason to remain in Rivergard, Grimjaw permits the characters to stay only as long as needed, giving them bunks in <strong>area K8</strong>.</li>
<li>If the party seems to know something but appears weak or dangerous, Grimjaw orders the cultists to attack.</li>
<li>If the party seems to know something and appears to be important (or useful as recruits), Grimjaw allows them to stay, giving them bunks in <strong>area K8</strong>.</li>

<p>This room houses the servants who work in the kitchens and tend to menial chores throughout the castle. Three human commoner (Anya, Berd, and Nayreen) currently work in here. They are natives of Womford who were kidnapped by the Crushing Wave cult and brought here to take care of cleaning, cooking, laundry, and waiting on the cult warriors. All three are anxious to escape and head home, but they don&rsquo;t dare try. Grimjaw has already had two others flogged to death for attempting to flee.</p>

<p>Five human commoner labor here. Two (Lathna and Oric) are captives who don&rsquo;t want to be here, but the other three (Gorm, Herek, and Shadnil) are neer-do-wells from Womford.

<p><strong>Six ghouls</strong> lurk in the waters just beyond the boat landing. They have orders to make sure that only cultists proceed to the Temple of the Crushing Wave, which lies more than two miles upstream. The ghouls attack anyone who begins rowing upstream without first standing in the bow of the boat and making the hand sign of the Crushing Wave. Spotting the ghouls in the inky water requires a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p>All six ghouls spend their first action of any combat combining their efforts to overturn a boat and dump its passengers into the river. Doing so allows three of the ghouls to use their actions to attempt Strength checks, while three others use their actions to take the Help action.

<p>Few people in the area have heard of the Sacred Stone order. No one in the region knows the truth: the monastery now serves as the surface headquarters of the Black Earth cult and guards access to the unholy vaults of the Temple of Black Earth below.</p>

They quietly recruit monsters and kidnap travelers and isolated miners to work as slaves in their mines, but they&rsquo;re careful to eliminate witnesses. So far no one suspects that &ldquo;those reclusive monks&rdquo; are behind the troubles. In fact, so little attention comes this way that the sacred stone monk hardly bother to keep their monstrous allies out of sight or to misdirect nosy intruders.</p>

A group of strangers that knocks on the door is turned away. Insistent visitors are told, &ldquo;The abbess doesn&rsquo;t allow visitors to disturb our meditations,&rdquo; and are attacked if they refuse to leave.</p>
<p>If the characters ask about the Mirabar delegation, the monks at the door say, &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; and turn the party away. Suspicious characters might sense that the monks are exchanging furtive glances with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) skill check.</p>

Asking for Hellenrae, Marlos Urnrayle, or Miraj Vizann by name suffices as proof, as does producing something that would pique the Black Earth cultists interest.

If the characters acquire these articles, they can don the monks clothing and disguise themselves. Characters disguised as sacred stone monk can move about the monastery without being challenged, as long as they avoid talking too much. The gargoyles in areas M8 and M14 don&rsquo;t attack characters dressed in Sacred Stone robes and masks. Other villains and monsters ignore the disguised characters unless they act suspiciously.</p>

Undisguised adventurers roaming around the halls without an escort are immediately identified as intruders and attacked.</p>
<p>The cultists don&rsquo;t have an organized response to an attack. Most of the monastery denizens are fatalistic, inclined to stand their ground and fight it out with intruders instead of trying to escape and raise the alarm. However, the cultists do respond aggressively to the sounds of fighting. When a fight begins in an area, check adjacent areas to see if any other monsters or villains are nearby. Then decide if and when such foes join an ongoing battle. This might lead to deadly combat encounters for the characters, since new opponents can rush in to join a fight that is still in progress, or arrive while the characters try to rest after a tough battle.</p>

Passage of Stone</h3><p>When the characters arrive at the Sacred Stone Monastery, read the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A trail leads into an ever-narrowing defile between bluffs of wind-sculpted sandstone. Eventually the walls draw in so closely that you can reach out and touch either side, but then the narrow space opens into a hidden canyon in the heart of the hills. A sprawling monastery with dark, narrow windows and red tile rooftops stands in the middle of this natural amphitheater, ringed by sandstone cliffs all around.</p>
<p>Ahead, a weathered flight of stone steps leads up to the closed monastery doors. The plain doors are made of heavy timber with iron studs. A dusty footpath circles the building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters scout around the other sides of the building, add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A small door, perhaps a servants entrance, is on the northwest side of the monastery. On the northeast side, a low wall encloses a good-sized garden with a locked gate. The eastern portion of the monastery is in very poor repair-the walls there are crumbling, and the windows have been bricked up with old masonry. A small side door is near that section, in the southeast portion of the building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody inside the monastery pays much attention to people skulking around outside, although characters who make a commotion might attract the attention of cultists whose windows look out in the right direction.</p>
<p>All outside doors are locked after nightfall.</p>

The mask is fashioned in the shape of a scowling gargoyle, but the hand that opened the panel seems human enough. From beneath the mask comes a female voice: &ldquo;Yes? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The monks listen to their visitors story, then turn the party away unless the characters make convincing arguments about their importance. If the doors are unlocked, the characters can walk in without announcing themselves. In this case, they find two monks dressed in dun-colored robes waiting impassively in the hall. The monks ask what they want and the conversation proceeds in much the same way.</p>
<p>Once the characters pass the front door, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This austere hall is finished in irregular blocks of dark basalt that form natural columns along the walls. The doors of the monasterys front entrance face south, while interior doors lead east and west. An interior courtyard lies just to the north of this room, visible through a pair of narrow windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The monks attack without warning if anyone attempts to leave through the east or west doors without an escort. If the monks are convinced that the characters are potential recruits or engaged in important cult business, one of the monks guides the party to <strong>area M9</strong> to meet Qarbo.</p>

<p>This room houses ten sacred stone monk (see chapter 7). During the day, the room is empty as the monks attend to their duties elsewhere. At night, six monks sleep in this room, two remain awake, and two work in <strong>area M7</strong>. The two monks who remain awake watch to make sure no one sneaks out to raid the kitchen or the distillery, or otherwise behaves inappropriately for a monk. If combat occurs, sleeping monks wake up and stand up during their first turn. They can each take a normal second turn.</p>

<p>Back in the days when the inhabitants of the monastery offered shelter to travelers, this room served as the monastery&rsquo;s guest room. Few people come this way now, so the Black Earth priest Qarbo uses this space as his personal quarters. Qarbo keeps two black earth guard at his beck and call to serve as bodyguards. See chapter 7 for the cultists statistics.</p>
<p>Qarbo rests here from midnight to shortly after dawn. He spends the rest of his time in <strong>area M9</strong>, the Shrine of Stone. When Qarbo and his guards are here, they lock the door and sleep.</p>

<p>The cultists spend little time in this common room. They spend most of their waking hours working or training in other parts of the monastery. When they aren&rsquo;t working, they&rsquo;re resting in their quarters.</p>
<p>At dawn and dusk, the Sacred Stone cultists (except the two door wardens in <strong>area M2</strong>) gather in this room for half an hour to dine together in silence. At mealtimes, twelve sacred stone monk eat here, along with Hellenrae, the Black Earth priest Qarbo, and the two Black Earth guards who protect Qarbo.

<p>The two statues nearest the temple door are actually <strong>two gargoyles</strong>, hiding in plain sight.

<p>Anyone who looks in the northwest corner notices a small bronze lever (see that section).</p>
<p>The Black Earth cultists claimed the old temples main hall as their own, and now this shrine serves as a holy place for the cult members who garrison this outpost-and a proving ground for those who wish to join. When not in <strong>area M4</strong>, the Black Earth priest Qarbo presides here, protected by <strong>two Black Earth guards</strong> (see chapter 7 for both).

It therefore falls to Qarbo to interrogate any guests or recruits. If the characters are presented to him (perhaps because they claim they want to join), Qarbo questions them to determine how committed they are to the cult.</p>
<p>Qarbo is cruel and more than a little manic in his demeanor. He grins slyly the entire time he questions the characters, as if enjoying an inside joke. He asks questions such as, &ldquo;What is your greatest failing?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why do you think you are worthy to be a servant of eternal earth?&rdquo; There are no right or wrong answers; the priest just wants to see how the newcomers react.</p>
<p>After hearing out the characters, Qarbo chooses one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the party seems ready to join the cult, Qarbo explains that they must start with a period of self-denial and reflection. He sends for a pair of sacred stone monk from <strong>area M7</strong>, who take all the characters equipment and clothing and provide them with Sacred Stone monk robes. If the characters accede to this, they are split up and assigned pallets in areas M3 and M5. Over the next few days, they are assigned routine chores in the kitchens and watched carefully.</li>
<li>If the party seems committed to speaking with higher-ups in the cult (for example, Miraj Vizann), Qarbo reluctantly assigns them space in the guest quarters (<strong>area M4</strong>) and sends word down to the Temple of Black Earth. Within a day or two, the characters are summoned to the temple (see chapter 4). The sacred stone monk provide a guide to show them the way.</li>
<li>If the party is antagonistic or doesn&rsquo;t seem to be of potential value to the cult, Qarbo feigns acceptance and tells them that they may &ldquo;proceed below,&rdquo; indicating the stairs leading to <strong>area M21</strong>. When the majority of the party is on the steps, he pulls the lever and dumps the party into <strong>area M21</strong>, also releasing the angry umber hulk in that area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Qarbo is eager to let the umber hulk in <strong>area M21</strong> have its fun, so he prefers the third option. If the characters survive the experience, he is quite surprised but hurriedly explains that &ldquo;they passed the test&rdquo; and accepts them into the cult or forwards their offer to the leaders in the temple.</p>
<p>The austere shrine offers no treasure, but Qarbo carries the keys to the chest in <strong>area M4</strong> and the doors leading into <strong>area M21</strong>.</p>

<p>The western stairs lead to <strong>area M18</strong> in the mines below the monastery. The northern stairs descend to a doorway that opens into the garden (<strong>area M14</strong>).</p>
<p>The buckets are for fetching water from the well in <strong>area M18</strong>, a daily chore for the monks.</p>

Abbess&rsquo;s Chambers</h3><p>The door to this room is locked at night. Hellenrae doesn&rsquo;t wish to be disturbed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This large room contains a wooden table with four chairs, a small working desk, several macrame wall hangings, and a single pallet on a low stone shelf set against the west wall. To the north, a barred window looks out over a walled garden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hellenrae (see chapter 7), the Abbess of Stone, resides here. She spends little time in her room during the day, preferring to exercise and mediate in the dojo (<strong>area M15</strong>). At night she retires to this room, but she sleeps only in brief catnaps-even in the middle of the night there is a fifty percent chance that she is wide awake.</p>
<p>If confronted here by intruders, Hellenrae immediately attacks. If she is disturbed by individuals who appear to be new recruits or guests of the cult, she curtly informs them that Qarbo can attend to their needs and dismisses them from her presence.</p>

However, a catch below the sill releases the bars and lets them swing open, so that a person with a slight build can easily wriggle out of the window and drop to the garden below (<strong>area M14</strong>). Hellenrae flees by this route if she is cornered and doesn&rsquo;t believe she can defeat her enemies.</p>

The monastery also needs funds from time to time. A large wooden chest by the desk contains 800 sp, 65 pp, and 12 turquoise stones worth 10 gp each, wrapped in a swatch of cowhide.</p>
<p>The key to <strong>area M13</strong> hangs from a hook on the wall by the rooms door. Hellenrae wears the key to the padlock in <strong>area M24</strong> on a leather cord around her neck.</p>

<p>Piles of firewood are stacked neatly against one wall of this room, and four large copper kettles stand in iron frames above iron fireboxes. Copper tubing in long coils leads from one kettle to the next. Several large wooden casks stand at the south end of the room, and shelves on the eastern wall hold scores of brown bottles sealed with red wax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sacred Stone monks have little use for brandy, but Hellenrae recognizes that innocuous activities like producing liquor for visitors might help to conceal the true nature of the Black Earth cults studies and philosophy. It is also a useful chore to occupy her monks. During the day, two sacred stone monk (see chapter 7) work here, tending the fires.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A walled garden shelters beneath the northern wall of the monastery. The garden is poorly kept, although some effort has been made to clear footpaths through the overgrowth. A garden gate to the northeast leads outside. Three doors open into the monastery at the southeast, south, and western side of the garden. The statues in the garden are particularly lifelike.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statues are the handiwork of Marlos Urnrayle. He rarely visits the monastery now, but he lived here when he was first establishing the earth cult in the area.</p>
<p>Two of the statues in this garden are actually gargoyle. The monsters ignore cultists but freely attack intruders who wander into the area.</p>

<p>Straw mats cover the floor of this large exercise room, and wooden racks along the walls hold quarterstaffs, polearms, and various weapons commonly associated with martial arts. Doors exit to the north and the east. A triangular symbol is carved into the center of the rooms western wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hellenrae (see chapter 7), the Abbess of Stone, spends much of her daytime here, sparring with her monks or leading them in various meditations. At any given time, four sacred stone monk (see chapter 7) practice with her. Hellenraes instruction consists of beating her followers senseless, so the two monks are at half their normal hit points.</p>
<p>If confronted by individuals she believes to be new recruits, Hellenrae calls them out and tests them personally in hand-to-hand combat. She chooses one character at a time to challenge. If her intended sparring partner declines, Hellenrae attacks anyway. She ends the bout when the victim is down to half hit points or less, or when she is. If multiple characters attack her at once, she realizes at once that this is no longer a practice session and tries her best to kill or incapacitate as many of her foes as possible. Her battered sacred stone monk join in as well.</p>
<p>If the characters somehow get Hellenrae into a talkative mood (a difficult prospect), she explains that she sees the Sacred Stone Monastery as a stepping-stone to service in the Black Earth temple. Its her job to use discipline and drudgery to make newcomers worthy servants of elemental earth. She speaks of Marlos Urnrayle with glowing praise and relates the story of his visions and his efforts (see &ldquo;Marloss Testament&rdquo; in <strong>area M10</strong>).</p>
<p>Ordinary clubs and staffs fill the wooden weapons racks. The sign on the wall is the symbol of the earth cult. Hellenrae wears the key to the lock in <strong>area M24</strong> on a leather cord around her neck.</p>

Renwicks Tower</h3><p>The door from <strong>area M14</strong> to M16 is protected by an arcane lock spell (cast by the lich Renwick), as is the door leading to the passage to the southwest. Stairs to the north lead down to <strong>area M20</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This older part of the monastery has been fitted out as a laboratory, with work tables covered in alchemical apparatuses and shelves full of strange curios and dusty clay jars. The windows have been bricked up, and cobwebs hang thick in the ceiling corners. An ancient figure peruses a heavy tome that lies open on a small desk, making notes on sheets of parchment covered in arcane writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This portion of the monastery serves as the demesne of a long-term tenant of the Sacred Stone Monastery, a lich named Renwick Caradoon. The lich isn&rsquo;t a member of the Black Earth cult, and he doesn&rsquo;t care about the other residents of the monastery as long as they don&rsquo;t interrupt his studies.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, Renwick was a hero of some renown and the brother of Samular Caradoon, the founder of the Knights of Samular. The two of them fought bravely in the second Troll War. Renwicks hunger for arcane knowledge eventually led him to prepare for lichdom, but he became a lich only because his brother fed him a lichdom potion on the battlefield rather than let him die. The Black Earth cult naturally tried to make an ally of Renwick, but he ignored them. Hellenrae and her monks make a point of leaving him to his own devices.</p>

If he believes the characters are Black Earth cultists, he says, &ldquo;I have already told you no. Depart.&rdquo; If confronted by characters he believes aren&rsquo;t cultists, he says, &ldquo;I am not your enemy. Now go.&rdquo; If the characters provoke him, he provides fair warning: &ldquo;In a moment I will fill this room with deadly poisonous gas. You should leave now.&rdquo; If attacked without warning, Renwick uses time stop, then casts cloudkill before taking his leave. (The lich has time stop prepared instead of power word kill. His list of prepared spells is otherwise the same as the lich presented in the Monster Manual.)</p>
<p>If the characters recognize Renwick (perhaps from the stories told at Summit Hall) and remind him of his heroic days, Renwick might be moved to help them. He doesn&rsquo;t want to fight the cultists since he no longer has any wish to kill, but if persuaded to help, he bestows a gift on any paladin or good-aligned fighter in the party: an amulet of health. He also promises to keep more cultists from reoccupying the monastery after the characters drive them out, and he might part with some of the potions and scrolls described in the next section.</p>

<p>At the end of this tunnel, three cell-like rooms have been excavated from the rock. Iron bars wall off each one, with a chain and padlock securing a swinging gate. Inside, a number of prisoners huddle on miserable straw pallets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cage door leading into each of these pens is locked. Jurth (in <strong>area M18</strong>) holds the key. Forcing open a cage door requires a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>
<p>The cells hold a total of seventeen commoner. Most are human peasants, caravan drivers, merchants, or tribesfolk. However, one is the dwarven sage Bruldenthar, one of the missing members of the delegation from Mirabar.</p>
<p>The cults prisoners, who have been working in the mines, beg for the characters to free them from their pens and lead them out of the monastery. They know that Jurth carries the keys to the pens, and that he can be found in the guardroom to the north (<strong>area M18</strong>). If questioned, they tell stories of raiders wearing brown cowls or hoods sweeping into town and carrying them back to servitude in the mines. Strangely, the mine contains no valuable ores.</p>

<p>This barrel-vaulted chamber is obviously an ancient crypt. Niches along the walls hold dozens of old skeletons, some with scraps of burial cloth still clinging to their bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not all the monsters beneath the monastery belong to the Black Earth cult. The crypt is part of the dungeon claimed by the lich Renwick, who normally can be found in his workshop (<strong>area M16</strong>). The lich retreats here to avoid confronting determined attackers. Six zombie guard this place, lying among the remains of the long-dead priests and monks who first built it.

Hall of Thirsting Stone</h3><p>The doors leading into this room are made of iron plate and secured with strong but simple locks (DC 20 Strength check to force open, or a DC 10 Dexterity check to pick with thieves tools).</p>
<p>If the characters listen at the western door, they hear something large moving around restlessly just on the other side. Knocking or making a commotion outside the door provokes the creature in the room to bellow and throw itself against the door, which booms and rattles but otherwise holds.</p>
<p>The wide stairway at the south end leads up to the Shrine of Stone (<strong>area M9</strong>) in the upper monastery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The floor of this large chamber consists of loose red earth. A column of natural stone stands near the middle of the room, and a row of sturdy iron bars with a sliding cage door (currently shut) walls off the western portion of the room. A door of iron plate stands in the western wall behind the iron bars, while a similar door exits to the east. To the south, a wide set of stairs leads up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters enter the room from the stairs or the eastern door, add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behind the iron bars stands a monstrous creature that resembles a cross between a huge ape and a beetle. It has wicked mandibles, powerful claws, and four eye sockets-but two of its eyes have been put out, and its claws are bronze blades. The creature bellows and thrashes in rage, constantly testing the bars and clawing at the walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The monster in the western portion of the chamber is an umber hulk. The cultists partially blinded the creature and removed its natural claws, so the hulk no longer has its Confusing Gaze power or the ability to burrow. However, the artificial blades increase its claw damage to 14 (<wc-roll>2d8+5</wc-roll>) slashing damage. The angry, trapped umber hulk eagerly attacks anything it can reach. If the characters goad it through the bars (for example, by attacking with ranged weapons or spells), the umber hulk goes berserk. It can use an action to attempt a DC 20 Strength check on each of its turns to wrench the cage door open.</p>
<p>The natural stone column and the floor of loose earth are harmless. The earth is about 5 feet deep with hard rock underneath; its not any harder to walk across than firmly packed sand.</p>

A character actively searching the stairs for traps notices the collapsing mechanism with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
<p>Anyone on the stairs when the lever is activated slides to the foot of the stairs and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. While the stairs are collapsed, climbing back up requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p>
<p>Typically, the Black Earth cultists shove victims down the stairs and pull the lever, simultaneously releasing the caged umber hulk and making sure the victims (and the monster) cant escape back up the stairs.</p>

This is no mine tunnel-the stonework is near-perfect despite its evident age. To the right, a short passage leads to a big door of iron plate, dented in from the other side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hellenrae and Jurth have keys to this gate. The stairs descend about 250 feet before reaching the Temple of Black Earth (see chapter 4). Any dwarf recognizes the steps as dwarven stonework, most likely thousands of years old.</p>
<p>The door to the east is locked and leads to <strong>area M21</strong>; Jurth and Qarbo hold the keys.</p>

Several groups have set up camps on the slopes below Scarlet Moon Hall, waiting for Elizar to invite them up to partake in the rite. He has convinced those gathered here that he&rsquo;s a druid of the Circle of the Scarlet Moon and promises to teach others the rite as its performed. The atmosphere is one of festive anticipation. Real druids here are excited to meet their fellows and learn from the mysterious but powerful Elizar.</p>

<p>Visible through the haze that covers the hill is a square tower ringed by ruined walls. In front of the tower burns a bonfire shaped like a fiery giant. Scattered on the slope below the tower are seven bonfires with tents clustered around them. Humanoid figures huddle near these closer fires. A trail leads up to these hillside encampments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the haze, characters can sneak past or overcome a camp without arousing the attention of the others. Whether or not they attract the attention of nearby camps depends on how quiet they are. Keep in mind that the brown bear (camp Hc2), werewolves (camp Hc3), and worgs (camp Hc7) all have keen senses that don&rsquo;t depend on sight.</p>
<p>The denizens of a camp cry out an alarm only if they&rsquo;re clearly losing a fight. Absent extenuating circumstances, though, they don&rsquo;t repeat the alarm round after round.</p>
<p>Once a battle starts, reinforcements arrive in waves. Its conceivable that, once a few camps empty out, the rest hunker down and hope that whatever is attacking the other camps doesn&rsquo;t come their way.</p>
<p>Characters can avoid the camps entirely by circling the hill and climbing its north side. The north side of the hill is steep but navigable, and can be climbed without having to make ability checks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The four druid (Varigo, Mahoon, Iniri, and Fariya) are looking forward to the Rite of the Wicker Giant and hope it leads to greater cooperation among the druids of the Dessarin Valley. These druids are already celebrating in hopes of a successful rite. They offer the characters food and drink, including a few sips from a small cask of brandy, and encourage the group to spend the night and witness the rite, which should occur tomorrow.</p>
<p>The fire cultists have decided that these druids are unsuitable for induction into the cult. Elizar plans to feed them to the wicker giant during the rite.</p>
<p>These druids fight only if attacked, spurring their two elk companions into battle. They beg for mercy once half of them (including the elk) are down.</p>

<p>The werewolves pretend to be interested in the rite, but prolonged conversation with strangers frustrates them. Any conversational hostility causes them to snap, assume hybrid forms, and attack.</p>

<p>Gariena fights only if attacked and happily shares her campfire with friendly characters. No one can camp here, though. The sprites cant be trusted to refrain from pranks, and Gariena wants no trouble.</p>

<p>Elizar Dryflagon (see chapter 7), an older man in robes and carrying a pipe, is here if he didnt join a battle in <strong>area H7</strong>. Behind a veneer of good humor is the heart of a pyromaniac. He doesn&rsquo;t parley for long, preferring to burn the characters out of existence.</p>

The party can still deal with any campers still on the slope.</p>
<p>The tunnel in <strong>area H6</strong> leads to <strong>area E1</strong> in the Temple of Eternal Flame. If you aren&rsquo;t ready for the characters to explore that temple, a force from the temple could emerge to drive the characters away. Or, you can allow the characters to descend to the Temple of Eternal Flame and discover how dangerous it is for themselves.</p>
