<p>The rise of Elemental Evil in Faerun begins in the Dessarin Valley, a lightly settled region of caravan towns, isolated homesteads, and uninhabited wilderness just a weeks journey from Waterdeep. Nothing of note to the wider world has happened here for hundreds of years. The frontier long ago receded farther northward, leaving behind a quiet backwater littered with ruins. These days, the Dessarin Valley has little in common with the popular conception of the Savage Frontier. Winters are hard here, but the hordes of orcs and other hungry monsters are a long way off from these parts.</p>
<p>If the Dessarin Valley isn&rsquo;t quite as wild and lawless as it once was, it&rsquo;s still lightly settled territory that serves as a route to distant lands. Residents in places such as Red Larch or Triboar boast that their humble settlements are &ldquo;the Gateway to the North.&rdquo; Through these lands pass hundreds of caravans and keelboats each year, linking the great ports of Waterdeep and Neverwinter with places such as Everlund, Mirabar, or Silverymoon. The steady caravan traffic breathes life into the towns of this area, supporting businesses in the settlements along the Long Road. Inns cater to travelers anxious to sleep safely within sturdy walls and enjoy good food by a warm fire instead of camping by the side of the road.</p>
<p>In addition to catering to caravans and travelers heading to or from the far North, the Dessarin Valley is a breadbasket for the hungry populations of Waterdeep and Neverwinter. The farms and pastures of the area produce grain, livestock, poultry, apples, and hops, then ship them downriver (or drive them down the Long Road) to the coast. Few people become rich from farming, but farmers in the region do well for themselves provided the weather cooperates. (That&rsquo;s one reason why the unusual weather lately has been a concern.)</p>
<h2 id=history>
<a href=#history class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>History</h2><p>Most people who live in the Dessarin Valley have no idea of its long history. Old-timers nodding sagely by the hearths of the local taprooms sometimes observe, &ldquo;These lands, they have old bones.&rdquo; Most locals have no idea of how right they are.</p>
<p>While some truly ancient ruins in this area go back to the days of the first great elf kingdoms, none of these figure into the story of this adventure. The earliest realm that does is the shield dwarf kingdom of Besilmer, which was founded nearly six thousand years ago in -4420 DR. Its existence is so far back in the mists of history that only a handful of non-dwarf sages have even heard of it. Most people of the Dessarin Valley don&rsquo;t know Besilmer at all, but they are familiar with two of its works: the engineering marvel known as the Stone Bridge (described later in this chapter) and the crumbling ruins known as the Halls of the Hunting Axe.</p>
<p>The realm of Besilmer was something rare: a dwarven kingdom built on the surface, with its strength measured in fields and pastures. It prospered for a time but was plagued by trolls and giants. The dwarves were obliged to build a stronghold underground, carving out the fortress-city of Tyar-Besil a century after Besilmers founding. Unfortunately for the dwarves, the realm collapsed after its king and founder died in battle. Most of the surviving dwarves sought safer lands. The dwarven city beneath the Sumber Hills was abandoned by -4160 DR and then forgotten.</p>
<p>Tyar-Besil slumbered in darkness for many long centuries, occasionally discovered and occupied by monsters or ambitious miners, only to be abandoned again. It came to light again in 893 DR, when a group of adventurers who called themselves the Knights of the Silver Horn discovered the ruins. Over the next six years they returned again and again, eventually founding strongholds of their own to safeguard the hidden entrances to the sprawling dungeon.</p>
<p>The knights had some success in clearing small domains in the wild Sumber Hills, but only a few years later the powerful orc realm of Uruth Ukrypt arose nearby, and the Dessarin Valley became a battlefield. Trouble followed on trouble: the Orcfastings War, the First and Second Trollwars, and finally a series of vicious drow raids. By the year 942 DR, human settlements in the Dessarin Valley had been all but wiped out, and the Knights of the Silver Horn were no more. Their strongholds crumbled into ruin and became known in later years as the Haunted Keeps. Eventually, no one remembered who built them or why.</p>
<p>The current wave of settlement in and around the Dessarin Valley began after 1000 DR, coinciding with Waterdeeps growth from a warlords stronghold into a major city. The first small outposts that would grow into places such as Red Larch and Triboar were carved out of a wild and untamed land. People resettling the Dessarin Valley found the remains of &ldquo;kingdoms of old&rdquo; scattered here and there throughout the area.</p>

The adventure is set in 1491 DR, the Year of the Scarlet Witch.</p>
<p>Each month consists of three ten-day long weeks called tendays. People refer to tendays the way people in other worlds refer to weeks.</p>

Bands of savage humanoids from the Sword Mountains or the Evermoors occasionally raid here. Human barbarians known as the Uthgardt roam these lands, and the more aggressive tribes can be very dangerous. Bandits sometimes gather in the lonelier parts of the vale to waylay caravans traveling the Long Road or the Kheldell Path. Every now and then reckless or unlucky adventurers manage to stir up some ancient curse in the ruins scattered around the area. Constables of valley settlements are usually up to the task of restoring the peace.</p>
<p>Six months ago, an insidious new threat began to grow in the area, unsuspected by the locals or any passing adventurers. Dreams and visions drew four elemental prophets, one by one, to the Fane of the Eye beneath the Sumber Hills. Each prophet began to gather like-minded followers. Strangers trickled into the Dessarin Valley in ones or twos. Some were already cultists of Elemental Evil, eager to build a place where they could openly practice their vile rites. Others were brutal thugs, power-hungry dabblers in forbidden magic, or fanatics lured by the call of evil. At first the cultists valued secrecy above all else, but as their numbers grew and they established their strongholds, they turned their attention to expanding their hold on the Dessarin Valley.</p>
<p>The presence of so many malefactors has caused a spate of banditry, kidnappings, murders, and raids. The cultists have also upset the weather in the region. All of these occurrences continue to worsen over the course of the adventure until the characters locate and clean out the four elemental cults in the Temple of Elemental Evil.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Red Larch has been an important stop on the Long Road for two centuries now. Named for a distinctive stand of red larch trees that were cut down when the hamlet was founded, Red Larch became a settlement in the first place thanks to a drinkable spring that fed a sizable pond ideal for watering horses, oxen, and pack mules.</p>
<p>An east-west trail meets the Long Road at the pond, running west to the logging community of Kheldell and east to Bargewright Inn and eventually Secomber. Another trail leads to quarries in the Sumber Hills and to ruins of stone keeps long ago left to monsters and outlaws (the Haunted Keeps).</p>
<p>In recent years, new quarries have been opened on the northwestern edge of town. So far these have yielded up great slabs of marble much prized in Waterdeep for facing large new buildings and repairing older edifices. Red Larch is also a center for stonecutters quarrying slate on the fringes of the Sumber Hills.</p>
<p>While Red Larch remains prosperous, dark omens are appearing. The heart of the Sumber Hills has become far more dangerous, with monsters lurking seemingly everywhere (no one goes into the hills berry-picking or hare-hunting these days, though Red Larcher children traditionally did so daily in summer and fall). Banditry is on the rise, and the weather seems to be getting more severe and more unpredictable. Several Red Larcher shepherds have seen strange figures watching them from distant hillsides in the wild fields east of town where they have traditionally grazed their flocks. Quarry workers used to cut by torchlight when orders were backing up but do so no longer, shunning the pits by night. They are spooked by rumors of dark-robed figures in stone masks lurking in the darkness beyond the torchlight. The townsfolk fear that dangerous times are at hand, but no one seems to know what to do about it.</p>

Most hope to convince adventurers to investigate and put an end to the current troubles.</p>
<p>Important Red Larchers include the following NPCs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eldras Tantur</strong> is the local blacksmith (<strong>area 9</strong>). He&rsquo;s an opinion setter in town.</li>
<li><strong>Endrith Vallivoe</strong> is a merchant who sells all sorts of goods from his shop (<strong>area 22</strong>). He is a Harper contact.</li>
<li><strong>Haeleeya Hanadroum</strong> is the owner of the bathhouse (<strong>area 15</strong>). She is an Emerald Enclave contact.</li>
<li><strong>Helvur and Maegla Tarnlar</strong> are clothiers (<strong>area 7</strong>). Both are Lords' Alliance contacts.</li>
<li><strong>Harburk Tuthmarillar</strong> is the Constable of Red Larch, a stern, honest guard commander and judge. He lives and works in <strong>area 11</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Imdarr Relvaunder</strong> is a priest of Tempus in the Allfaiths Shrine (<strong>area 1</strong>). He is a contact for the Order of the Gauntlet.</li>
<li><strong>Kaylessa Irkell</strong> is the proprietor of the Swinging Sword inn (<strong>area 2</strong>). She hears much from her fellow Red Larchers and shares it.</li>
<li><strong>Mangobarl Lorren</strong> is the towns baker (<strong>area 8</strong>). He is a Zhentarim contact.</li>
<li><strong>Marlandro Gaelkur</strong> is an unsavory local barber (and counterfeiter) who runs a useful secondhand shop (<strong>area 17</strong>) where Red Larchers gather to gossip.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=the-believers>
<a href=#the-believers class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Believers</h2><p>A dozen of the Red Larch town elders have a secret: They belong to a secret society that calls itself &ldquo;the Believers.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t quite a cult, although it has special ceremonies and rites passed down for generations. It isn&rsquo;t quite a civic organization, despite the fact that some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in Red Larch are members. The members of the Believers use their secret association to guide town affairs, plot against business competitors, and sometimes take care of people who cause problems when it becomes clear that &ldquo;something must be done&rdquo; for the good of the town.</p>
<p>The Believers formed years ago when local miners discovered a secret underground chamber beneath the town. Strange things happened in the chamber, such as heavy stones levitating and moving about when no one was around (this is described in chapter 6, in the &ldquo;Tomb of Moving Stones&rdquo; adventure). The miners began using the chamber to honor those who died in quarry accidents and to appease Beshaba, goddess of misfortune and accidents. The Believers gather secretly at the tomb once every nine nights to see if any stones have moved-and if any have, they covertly meet the next night to discuss what the movements mean, and what is to be done. They keep the tomb and its strange secret to themselves.</p>
<p>The Believers have no knowledge of Elemental Evil. However, the Cult of the Black Earth discovered their secret and became interested. A Black Earth priest named Larrakh came to Red Larch to steer the group toward the worship of elemental earth. The cultists intend to take over Red Larch through the Believers, but there are other, more important tasks beneath the Sumber Hills that are keeping them busy. The time is not yet right.</p>

The clues and rumors provided by the NPCs in Red Larch depend on which phase of the adventure you are currently running. If you prefer to start the adventurers at 3rd level and dive into the Elemental Evil plot immediately, begin with the &ldquo;Rumors of Evil&rdquo; clues. If you wish to start the adventurers at 1st level, begin with the &ldquo;Trouble in Red Larch&rdquo; rumors. When the party finishes the &ldquo;Trouble in Red Larch&rdquo; adventures, they reach 3rd level, and they&rsquo;re ready to move on to the &ldquo;Rumors of Evil&rdquo; clues and events.</p>
<h3 id=trouble-in-red-larch>

Asking around about whats going on in town or points the party toward the following NPCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlaws are lurking out on the Cairn Road, but Constable Harburk (<strong>area 11</strong>) hasnt found anything.</li>
<li>Minthra Mhandyvvers granddaughter Pell (<strong>area 13</strong>) saw a ghost by an old tomb not far from town.</li>
<li>The Tarnlar children (<strong>area 7</strong>) are telling wild tales about plague out by Lance Rock.</li>
<li>Kaylessa Irkell, the owner of the Swinging Sword Inn (<strong>area 2</strong>), thinks the towns troubles might have a common source.</li>
<li>Quarry workers at Mellikho Stoneworks (<strong>area 18</strong>) say that mysterious figures wearing stone masks watch them when they work at night. The workers now refuse to stay in the quarry after dark.</li>
<li>Workers at Waelvurs Wagonworks (<strong>area 16</strong>) have been talking about suspicious activity around the workshop. They can be found drinking in the Helm at Highsun (<strong>area 3</strong>) most evenings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking with the NPCs involved in these rumors provides the characters with several leads to adventure opportunities in Red Larch. These adventures are presented in chapter 6. &ldquo;Into the Wilderness&rdquo; describes several encounters located near town. &ldquo;Lance Rock&rdquo; describes an adventure site near the distinctive landmark a few miles outside of town; an insane necromancer who styles himself a &ldquo;lord&rdquo; has taken up residence there. Finally, &ldquo;The Tomb of Moving Stones&rdquo; presents an old dungeon-like mine chamber underlying part of Red Larch. This is the secret guarded by the Believers, although it has also attracted the attention of the Cult of the Black Earth.</p>
<h4 id=the-sinkhole>

If the adventurers don&rsquo;t find the tomb or explore other sites nearby first, the tombs secret is revealed by the appearance of a large sinkhole in town. The sinkhole opens up shortly after the characters return to Red Larch from Lance Rock or other explorations in the area; see the adventure in chapter 6 for more details.</p>

They pass information by slipping notes to or arranging brief conversations with cult messengers passing through town. Most of these messengers are human bandits from the local gangs of cult marauders, dressed in unmarked garments.</p>
<p>If confronted, the cult spies deny involvement in any wrongdoing and try to bluff their way out of trouble.</p>
<p>A spy caught red-handed weeps and begs for mercy. Some might claim to have been under a spell, hoping to gain sympathy. Caught spies reveal only whats necessary to save their own skins.</p>

It was a large, well-armed party, and the fact that it seems to have come to grief is quite newsworthy. When the characters sift through idle speculation and gossip to find credible leads, they turn up the following possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brother Eardon, a priest of Lathander staying in the Swinging Sword (<strong>area 2</strong>), says the Mirabarans passed through Beliard.</li>
<li>A caravan guard in the Helm at Highsun (<strong>area 3</strong>) says the Mirabarans passed through Beliard.</li>
<li>Endrith Vallivoe (<strong>area 22</strong>) recently came by a beautiful book in Dwarvish and has been showing it off. It looks old and important.</li>
<li>Larmon Greenboot, a shepherd, says he found strange new graves out in the Sumber Hills. He hangs around Gaelkurs store (<strong>area 17</strong>).</li>
<li>When the characters return to Red Larch after leaving to investigate one of the other leads, they hear that Thorsk Thelorn, the wagonmaker (<strong>area 5</strong>), has had some strange new customers lately.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out how these NPCs know what they know, the adventurers must question the key characters. These conversations should suggest several ways to begin the search for the delegation from Mirabar. Continue with the &ldquo;Early Investigations&rdquo; encounters in chapter 3 when the adventurers decide which lead to follow.</p>

<p>Here follow brief descriptions of important locations in town. Buildings shown on the map that don&rsquo;t have a number and a description are houses, sheds, or outbuildings. They belong to farmers who till plots close to town, shepherds who keep herds in nearby pastures, and workers or servants employed by the larger businesses.</p>
<p>Many of the locations in town feature information about the &ldquo;Trouble in Red Larch&rdquo; storyline (for 1st-level characters) or the &ldquo;Rumors of Evil&rdquo; storyline (for characters ready to investigate the cult of Elemental Evil). Just ignore the leads and clues that aren&rsquo;t relevant to the part of the adventure youre running now. You can assume that the Believers decide to keep a low profile as long as adventurers are asking questions about the missing delegation from Mirabar, or that the delegation hasnt arrived in the area yet if the adventurers begin with the local troubles.</p>

It is bland at the best of times, but badly made crumblecake tastes terrible.</p>

<p>On the west side of the Long Road, just south of the inns stable yard, stands what looks like a grand stone mansion. Two wide wooden doors painted with the symbols of many gods stand open day and night. Inside is a plain chapel with a stone altar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Allfaiths Shrine is a wayside shrine used by many faiths and owned by none. Priests shuttle out from Waterdeep in pairs for month-long stays. Each pairing includes priests of two different faiths arranged by Waterdhavian temples. The most frequent combinations are Sune and Selune, Tymora and Lathander, and Tempus and Oghma. The visiting priests dwell in two simple stone rooms at the back of the temple. They bring their own vestments and holy items and take them away again when their duties end.</p>

Imdarr is a stern man who is keenly interested in news and rumors and visitors. He&rsquo;s also an ally of the Order of the Gauntlet, occasionally passing messages and sending reports on local events to the order. Lymmura is a sympathetic ear and guide to all. She has been coming to the shrine for decades, has officiated at the marriages of many couples, and is widely loved and trusted in Red Larch.</p>

The Swinging Sword</h3><blockquote>
<p>One door north of the Allfaiths Shrine stands the Swinging Sword. The inn is a three-story stone structure, crowned by a steep slate roof that bristles with many chimneys. A signboard juts out over the door, hanging from chains. Its a ten-foot-long carved wooden scimitar emblazoned with the inns name in red paint on both sides. An inn yard with stables and outbuildings lies behind the building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Swinging Sword is welcoming and luxurious by the areas rustic standards. Each room boasts a hearth, warm draperies and tapestries, and running water (provided by rooftop cisterns). Now run by the Irkell family from Waterdeep, the inn has become a popular stopover for wayfarers in the Dessarin Valley. The topmost guest floor is given over to dormitories where travelers can &ldquo;sleep cheap&rdquo; in rooms shared with up to six guests, but the lower floors are divided into pleasant suites of guest rooms, each with its own garderobe. Theres also a dining room on the ground floor.</p>
<p>The Sword has one recurring problem: kitchen fires. The one-story kitchen annex at the back of the inn, currently out of commission, was initially built with poorly drawing chimneys. Right now, cooking is rudimentary and done out in the yard, on grills flanking the bread ovens. The dining room is mainly used for drinking, with &ldquo;the Helm&rdquo; (the tavern across the road) currently providing the best meals in town travelers can easily buy.</p>
<p>While the Helm at Highsun is the place to hear Red Larchers unwind, the Swinging Sword is the polite social hub and neutral meeting ground of Red Larch.</p>

She is the fortyish matriarch of her family and a pleasant, sturdy woman. She is increasingly worried about &ldquo;whats gathering in the dark&rdquo; in Red Larch and brings up her concerns with any likely adventurers who stop by (see &ldquo;Kaylessas Tale,&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>Kaylessas staff are uniformly attentive and good at their work. However, two have secret masters. Ghileeda (female Tethyrian human commoner), a maid, secretly reports to Justran Daehl at the Helm for the Cult of the Crushing Wave. The one-eyed stablemaster Iraun Thelder (male Tethyrian human guard), a onetime mercenary warrior, is a spy for the Cult of the Howling Hatred. Iraun is entirely passive; he just reports what his normal duties show him.</p>

If the characters don&rsquo;t approach her, Kaylessa tells them of recent disturbances near Red Larch. She&rsquo;s heard many tales about fogs that persist in the Sumber Hills even in bright sunlight, and sudden gusts of hot wind sweeping west out of the hills where breezes have always been cold. There have been more violent sights, too, such as sudden bolts of lightning stabbing up from the hills into a clear sky. &ldquo;Fell magic,&rdquo; Kaylessa terms it, though she admits this was an opinion shared with her, and she&rsquo;s seen none of this herself.</p>
<p>Kaylessa has also noticed some Red Larchers looking both frightened and furtive, and tersely turning aside innocent queries. If pressed, she names Mellikho the stonecutter (<strong>area 18</strong>) and Luruth the tanner (<strong>area 19</strong>).</p>

The Helm at Highsun</h3><blockquote>
<p>Right across the Long Road from the Swinging Sword Inn stands a ramshackle two-story tavern. Rusty metal grills cover its small, dirty windows. The taverns name is very clearly printed in large, simple letters on both sides of a jutting wooden sign. Atop the sign is a rusting, oversized adornment: a warriors bucket helm with two eye slits (actually an upside-down washtub).</p>
<p>Inside is a large, dimly lit, wood-paneled taproom. An open-tread wooden staircase climbs to the upper floor, which is just as dim and darkly paneled as the taproom. Across the back of the taproom is a long bar with three copper candle-lanterns hanging over it, and a stair leading down to the cellars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Helm at Highsun is where locals relax, gossip, flirt, tell jests and &ldquo;war stories&rdquo; of their working days, and get drunk. Its not a place for refined dining. A dozen servers work shifts at the Helm; most nights, two cover the ground floor and one waits on guests on the upper floor. The staff at the Helm don&rsquo;t gossip, but they direct anyone who questions them to other patrons they think might talk about a particular subject. A gift of a drink loosens most tongues.</p>
<p>The Helm gets rowdy from time to time, but the staff is ready for ordinary drunken fisticuffs.

Eldras and his children-a strapping son and two strong daughters-are skilled smiths who can make almost anything that requires no specialized alloys or treatments. They can temper swords and reinforce armor, and they often repair tools and weapons.</p>
<p>The Tanturs rarely emerge from their smithy. They work all day long every day filling endless orders for hasps, hinges, locks, and chains, plus hardware for wagons such as cotter pins, bolt rings, wheel rims, and wheel hubs.</p>

<p>The one-story building is long, narrow, and nondescript on the outside, but the name of the business is painted above the double entry doors (wide enough for a wagon). Inside, feathers drift in the air. Cages and casks sit at the street end of the building, followed by two brick cooking-hearths, long and bloodstained cutting tables, and a plucking area in the back.

<p>Next door to Drouths Fine Poultry stand four identical single-story stone buildings, running back from the street in a line. The front building has a painted sign of a ham being carved by a cleaver, accompanied by no words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the workplace and shop of Jalessa Ornra (female Illuskan human commoner), Red Larchs butcher. The second building is her smokehouse, joined to the shop by an underground cold-cellar where meats are stored. The third building often has wash hanging by clothesline outside, and is the home Jalessa shares with the towns constable, Harburk Tuthmarillar (male Tethyrian human veteran).</p>
<p>Red Larch doesn&rsquo;t have a jail or court. The shop is the closest thing. Harburk employs four trusties, who bunk in the fourth building. The trusties are assistant constables (human guards) who also work for Jalessa as cutters and preservers, brining and salting meat, then sealing it into small kegs for shipment or storage.</p>
<p>Harburk and his trusties discuss matters of law enforcement and peacekeeping while butchering. Theyve also been known to hang drunks by their belts from meat hooks to sober up.</p>

<p>This wooden building grew haphazardly for many years, shooting out single-story wings and annexes untidily in all directions. The interior looks like a barn or attic, with exposed beams and posts. Pens with live chickens fill most of the odd corners and halls of the building, leaving only a narrow aisle down to the back, where the Mhandyvvers live. Their rooms are separated from the chicken pens by a workroom with cutting benches and a central hearth.</p>

<p>Mhandyvvers is the less impressive of the two local poulterers, but is a favorite with Red Larchers. Kindly old Minthra &ldquo;Minny&rdquo; Mhandyvver (female Tethyrian human commoner) and her three grown children sell chickens live or roasted and preserved in oil, pickled chicken livers, and eggs both fresh and pickled.</p>

<p>Ilmeth spends most of his time repairing wagons and making heavy-duty wagons and sledges for the local quarries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inside, half a dozen wagons stand in various stages of assembly, surrounded by stools, ladders, and benches. Wooden pillars support a loft that is an open latticework of boards, serving as home to some birds and storage for scores of wooden wagon wheels.</p>

<p>The masked watchers are actually members of the Black Earth cult who work as laborers in the towns harness shops or warehouses; they are staying in Mother Yalanthas boarding house.

</blockquote>
<p>This is Aerego Bethendur (male Tethyrian human noble). He is assisted by three burly clerks and porters, who are former mercenary thugs.</p>
<p>Aerego asks no questions, so anything can be stored here. Stored items that don&rsquo;t move or burst out of their containers are left strictly alone, though crates that begin to smell of death are taken out back and opened.

The Dessarin River is an obstacle to any group without a boat, since no crossing can be found between Ironford and the Stone Bridge.</p>
<p>When the player characters set out to travel to another location, they either know how to get there or they don&rsquo;t. All settlements are known sites-it takes only a few minutes of asking around to get sufficient directions to another town. Likewise, the Dessarin River and Stone Bridge are well-known landmarks. Feathergale Spire is known to anyone in Red Larch. Rivergard Keep is known to some people in Bargewright Inn and Womford. Summit Hall is known to anyone in Beliard and Womford. The Halls of the Hunting Axe site is known to anyone in Beliard. Characters from the area or drawn here by a particular hook might know these locations.</p>

The town is named after Amphail the Just, one of Waterdeeps early warlords, who is said to haunt the surrounding hills in spirit form, frightening away monsters. Horses are bred and trained here, rich Waterdhavians maintain secluded estates in the hills, and farmland is plentiful. Stands of dark duskwood and spruce trees are everywhere.</p>
<p>In one corner of the town square stands the Great Shalarn, a black stone statue of a famous war stallion bred in Amphail long ago. Gelded by a prankster, the rearing horse is often painted bright colors by high-spirited locals. Children are allowed to hurl stones at birds perched on the statue, to keep it free of droppings. The children often climb it themselves and cling precariously to the high, tilted saddle, waving their arms and commanding imaginary armies into battle. Within spitting distance of the statue is the Stag-Horned Flagon, a cozy tavern.</p>

<p>Bargewright Inn reeks of manure and filthy mud. It houses blacksmiths, dealers who buy and sell horses, mules, and oxen, wheelwrights, coopers, and wagonmakers. It has inns, stables, and warehouses, and two concentric rings of high protective walls with gates that are firmly closed and barred by night. (Individuals can pay stiff fees to be raised and lowered after sunset on rope-slung chairs, but nothing beyond what they can carry can pass.)</p>
<p>Bargewright Inn fell under Zhentarim influence a few years ago. Any member or ally of that faction can find a discreet welcome (and few or low fees) within its walls. The Zhentarim spy on everyone, even each other (or as one merchant put it, &ldquo;especially each other&rdquo;). Bargewright Inn is ruled by a plutocracy of business owners, most of whom are in the pockets of the Zhentarim. The unofficial leader is Chalaska Muruin (female Damaran human veteran), the terse, cold-eyed &ldquo;Senior Sword&rdquo; and master of the gate guards.</p>
<p>The largest inn, The Old Bargewright, was recently rebuilt as a substantial stone structure with thick walls, secret passages, and private chambers separated from nearby rooms by sealed-off passages. Innkeeper Nalaskur Thaelond (male half-elf spy) keeps careful watch over who comes and goes from his inn; its where Zhentarim meet to broker deals in commerce illicit in Waterdeep, such as smuggled goods, poisons, and certain magic.</p>

It surrounds the intersection of the Dessarin Road with the Stone Trail.</p>
<p>Beliard is home to many cattle ranchers whose herds roam the hills around it, particularly to the east. The village offers a public well, as well as a pond where harnessed horses or oxen can be driven through the water to bathe them, drive off flies, and let them drink. Its also home to a tanner, a smith, some horse dealers and trainers who keep extensive stables, and an inn: the venerable, popular, and several-times-expanded Watchful Knight. The inn was originally named for an inoperative helmed horror that stood in the common room, but the creature mysteriously vanished years ago. The innkeeper went missing shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>In recent years, bodyguards and mercenaries formerly active in Waterdeep and along the Heartlands trade routes retired to Beliard, and their presence makes nearby brigands reluctant to raid the village directly. Because so many big-city folk settled here, rumors persist of cached treasure buried or otherwise hidden all over Beliard, but aside from a sack of gold coins found walled away behind stones in a chimney, nothing has yet been found-nothing that has become public knowledge, at least.</p>

Called &ldquo;the granary of the North,&rdquo; its the only reason many Northerners ever taste soft-fleshed fruit larger than bush berries. Waterdeep, Secomber, Yartar, and points beyond consume the temples reliable output: carefully husbanded grains and dried, oil-packed, or salted foodstuffs preserved in vast storage cellars, vats, ricks, and squat stone grain-towers.</p>
<p>Now run by Abbot Ellardin Darovik (male Tethyrian human priest), Goldenfields is a stronghold of the Emerald Enclave. Members of that faction are as welcome here as clergy of Chauntea; many of them stay for months at a time to help with the work and the vigilant defense of the farm against insects and blights, as well as would-be vandals and plunderers. Hired adventurers patrol the walls and the land immediately around them, watching for anyone approaching. More than five thousand people live and work in Goldenfields year round, farming more than twenty square miles of tillage in gangs of hard-working gardeners.</p>
<p>No guest at Goldenfields ever leaves hungry, and the farmer-priests expect that everyone should leave with &ldquo;food for a tenday or more on the road, and seeds for the future beyond that.&rdquo;</p>

The old city was a small forest of stone roundhouses, interlaced with gardens and joined by walls into one vast and sprawling building. It was surrounded by a moat fed by underground springs; splendid stone statues of heroic dwarves stood on high pedestals wherever one turned. All trace of the gigantic building is gone now except the foundations of its thickest, highest walls, which jut like lines of stone teeth from thickets of trees and creeping vines. For centuries, shards from magnificent windows of stained glass that once adorned the Halls have found their way into beautiful and distinctive glass bottles blown locally.</p>
<p>Stories in nearby Beliard warn of predatory creatures lurking in the extensive ruins. Despite forays by adventuring bands and dwarves determined to reclaim and explore the ruins, the halls rarely stay empty for long. As a result, travelers usually give the Halls of the Hunting Axe a wide berth.</p>
<p>Many dwarves and most local Harpers believe King Torhild Flametongue, the founder of Besilmer, lies entombed with his legendary greataxe somewhere beneath the Halls. (The rumor is true.) Some dwarven legends go further, saying the royal tomb was long deliberately sealed off by dwarves and that a fearsome curse befalls anyone who disturbs Torhilds rest.</p>

<p>Rivergard is home to a mercenary band led by &ldquo;Lord of the Castle&rdquo; Jolliver Grimjaw (see chapter 7). The band is repairing the old castle, and reroofing is their current major task. They claim their intention is to make Rivergard Keep their base for protecting river-borne trade from monsters and bandits. In truth, Grimjaw and his followers are themselves the bandits, and Rivergard Keep is secretly the stronghold of the Cult of the Crushing Wave.</p>

It consists of a fortified manor, stables, a guest lodge, and two outlying hunting lodges connected by grass paths that enclose a food and herb garden and a small lawn. A large, lightly wooded hunting preserve extends for several miles from the manor.</p>
<p>The Silmerhelves visit perhaps six times a year, and the rest of the time the sleepy estate is left to the live-in staff. Helvenblade has never been overrun by bandits or otherwise put to ruin; the servants ascribe this to its protection by the &ldquo;family ghost.&rdquo; In reality, a secretive dragon named Umsheryoth (adult male bronze dragon) guards the house and has been a friend to the Silmerhelves for generations.</p>

Larger than some kingdoms, its big enough to encompass mountains within its depths. It is home to treants of gigantic size, stags with antlers as wide across as a wagon, brown bears bigger than large sheds, owlbears, wolves, and unicorns. Woodcutters and even outlaws on the run dare visit only the verges of the High Forest. As everyone knows, those who venture too deep are seldom seen again.</p>
<p>In the northwestern High Forest stands Shadowtop Cathedral, a stand of towering shadowtop trees that is an important meeting-place for the Emerald Enclave. Foes of the enclave have to fight to reach it, but members can readily find aid, healing, and advice in the grove.</p>

Additional homesteads appear on the Random Encounters tables earlier in this chapter. Not even lifelong residents of the Dessarin Valley know exactly where all the outlying farms and ranches lie, and characters traveling cross country might stumble across lonely farmhouses or outlying ranches anywhere.</p>
<p>Since homesteads are permanent structures, make a note on the regional map when the characters discover one at random. It should be in the same place if the party passes through again.</p>
<p>A homestead usually consists of a farmhouse with thick shutters for the windows and a bar for the door, a barn or two containing livestock, a feed crib, and crops or pastures nearby. Most homesteaders are human or halfling commoners. They gladly welcome travelers (especially adventurers who look like they&rsquo;re trying to chase away outlaws and monsters) and are eager for news.

For centuries, this forest has been the home and hunting ground of the ancient female green dragon Claugiyliamatar, better known to many as &ldquo;Old Gnawbone.&rdquo; She earned her nickname by her habit of gnawing on old kills, and is often seen with a mangled corpse hanging from her mouth. Other dragons rarely remain in Kryptgarden Forest for long because Claugiyliamatar drives them out.</p>
<p>Hunters from Westbridge used to cautiously seek game along the easternmost verges of Kryptgarden but dare not do so now, after several hunting parties disappeared. Small game remains plentiful, but larger beasts are seldom seen. Presumably, such beasts have fallen prey to Old Gnawbone.</p>

Lance Rock is made of granite that doesn&rsquo;t match any other stone nearby, and looks like it was dropped from the sky-which it was. Long ago, Claugiyliamatar, the ancient green dragon known as &ldquo;Old Gnawbone,&rdquo; took the enormous stone from the Sword Mountains and dropped it on a rival red dragon.

Once known as the Jewel of the North, Neverwinter was badly damaged when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted about fifty years ago. The City of Skilled Hands works furiously to rebuild itself as a wealthy trading city known for its clocks and other superbly made local items. Neverwinter&rsquo;s reconstruction is far from complete, however. Entire sections of the city still lie in rubble, plagued by brigands and monsters, and sinister factions scheme to take over the place.</p>
<p>Neverwinter is part of the league of city-states known as the Lords' Alliance. Lord Dagult Neverember rules over the city, even though he isn&rsquo;t the true heir to Neverwinter&rsquo;s crown. He supports the alliances efforts to establish civilization throughout the North, although his primary concern is to rebuild the city and its economy.</p>
<p>The most direct route to Neverwinter from the Dessarin Valley is to head west along the trail from Triboar to the tiny town of Phandalin (about 140 miles), then north another 110 miles or so along the coastal road. Riders who know the way, travel light, and push hardy mounts can make the trip in as little as eight or nine days.</p>

This large stone mansion, now roofless and overgrown, is home to a mysterious and terrifying figure known far and wide as &ldquo;the Dark Lady.&rdquo; Locals warn everyone to stay well away from the ruins.</p>
<p>The truth of the tale is that the &ldquo;Dark Lady&rdquo; is a female adult black shadow dragon named Nurvureem, who has established her lair in the caverns beneath the manor. Her favorite shape is a beautiful female drow. In this form, Nurvureem lures adventurers into the manor and stalks them. She sometimes poses as a drow captive of a dragon, desperate to avoid being eaten and willing to pay with her treasure to be rescued. The Harpers have learned her secret, and do their best to spread stories of the Dark Lady to scare off curious or foolhardy adventurers. They warn fellow members to approach Nurvureem with extreme caution.</p>
<p>In recent months, Nurvureem has been pestered by elemental cultists looking for potential bases. By leaving their shredded corpses on the road for all to see, she hopes to make it clear to the cultists that they should leave Rundreth Manor alone.</p>

It is a sacred site of pilgrimage for many dwarves. Long ago, the dwarf god Moradin appeared atop the Stone Bridge to rally dwarves of the Ironstar clan against a horde of orcs. The founder of Besilmer, King Torhild Flametongue, died fighting a hill giant atop the Stone Bridge. (He is entombed within the Halls of the Hunting Axe.)</p>
<p>Built to connect those parts of the dwarven realm of Besilmer on both the western and eastern banks of the Dessarin, the Stone Bridge is made of smooth, fused hard granite.

Many of the hills have exposed rock faces or steep escarpments. While the hills are dry, countless tiny streams rise from hidden springs (usually clean and drinkable), then flow down to join the Dessarin River, which bisects the hills.</p>
<p>Most locals only think of the wilder, higher hills west of the river when they hear &ldquo;Sumber Hills,&rdquo; because its there that once had rich quarries and good hunting. Some hunting lodges and keeps owned by wealthy Waterdhavians or adventurers remain-and in recent times have become homes to bandits and monsters. Those who quarry the Sumber Hills for building stones and gravel often trade tales of finding gemstones and rich veins of ore in the hills-but for the most part, these persistent tales have never been more than talk.</p>
<p>In the last few years, the infamous &ldquo;Haunted Keeps&rdquo; in the western Sumber Hills have all been reoccupied. Sightings of strange beasts and menacing figures have increased, too.</p>

A paladin of Tyr named Samular Caradoon founded the order and its monastery. A tomb within the monastery contains Samulars remains as well as the phylactery of his brother, Renwick Caradoon, who dwells in the Sacred Stone Monastery (see &ldquo;Haunted Keeps&rdquo; above) as a lich.</p>
<p>Lady Ushien Stormbanner (female Tethyrian human knight of Tyr) oversees Summit Hall. Veterans, many of them scarred and grim, train novices and instruct them in the moral &ldquo;Rule of the Knights&rdquo; (an extensive series of &ldquo;in this situation, a knight shall do this&rdquo; guidelines). Life here is very regimented. The occupants of Summit Hall grow their own food and keep perpetual watch over nearby lands. They are always ready for battle, and fully armed and armored if encountered outside their walls.</p>

The site where elemental cultists attacked the delegation lies only a few miles away. Later in the adventure, characters affiliated with the Order of the Gauntlet can turn to the Knights of Samular to recruit guards for locations they&rsquo;ve cleared or other &ldquo;off camera&rdquo; needs for low-level soldiers.</p>

Triboar is the chief rival to Yartar, and the two communities compete for the trade of the Dessarin Valley.</p>
<p>The current lord protector is a good-natured Harper and ex-adventurer named Darathra Shendrel (female Tethyrian human knight), known for the excellent wine she makes. Darathra enacts and modifies local laws (known as &ldquo;The Lords' Decree&rdquo;), which are then enforced by &ldquo;The Twelve,&rdquo; a dozen mounted veterans drawn from the militia to serve in a tenday cycle.</p>
<p>Triboar is a horse-market for a dozen nearby ranches that turn out trained draft horses, riding mounts and ponies, and pack mules. Blacksmiths, harnessmakers, and wagonworks flourish in town. In addition, a number of guides operate from Triboar. They take merchants and other travelers all over the Sword Coast North (typically for stiff fees). Many of these guides are retired adventurers who know the North well.</p>
<p>A half-elf adventurer named Gervor and his companions went missing recently. The adventurers were staying in town, and locals expected them to return tendays ago. In addition, two important merchants from Waterdeep, Kharloss and Jarlee, are overdue. (Gervor is currently a prisoner in <strong>area B14</strong> of the Temple of the Black Earth, while the two Waterdhavians were captured by fire cultists on the Long Road. They are currently held in <strong>area W6</strong> of the Weeping Colossus.)</p>

Darathra is a key contact for characters affiliated with the Harpers. The Zhentarim has spies in the town as well, and its agents might contact the characters in the course of &ldquo;The Long Road&rdquo; side trek in chapter 6.</p>

The vale is on the west side of the river and found at the end of a secret trail leading south from the Stone Bridge.</p>
<p>Long ago, the vale was the site of the summer palace of King Torhild Flametongue of the dwarven kingdom of Besilmer. In time, it became a sacred place where dwarves come to worship their gods. Some legends among the Stout Folk say the cellars of the ancient palace hide riches of the royal treasury of Besilmer. (Actually, the palace collapsed long ago, but the shrine survives.) Recent sightings of monsters and roving bands of marauders in the Sumber Hills have alarmed the shield dwarf priests who tend the shrine. They worry that enemies might find the way to the hidden vale.</p>

A rider from Red Larch can reach Waterdeep in seven days, three if he or she changes horses often and dares to ride by night. Some merchants have termed Waterdeep &ldquo;the best supply center in the world,&rdquo; with the largest collection of superb craft workers, experts, useful contacts, and potential hirelings to be found anywhere. Others warn that it represents a huge army of potential enemies for those who aren&rsquo;t careful-and everyone agrees that its busy streets are full of spies.</p>
<p>Waterdhavian noble families and guilds hold tremendous political and economic sway up and down the Sword Coast, but within the city itself, true power lies with the Masked Lords' of Waterdeep-individuals who convene secretly and whose identities are largely unknown. The public face of this ruling body is the Open Lord of Waterdeep. The current Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand, has held the position for only a few months, and many of the citys nobles and guildmasters are vying for her attention and conspiring to wrest power away from her office, while taking advantage of the transition to dispose of unwanted rivals. This kind of political chaos is &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; for most city residents.</p>

The inn is run by the affable Herivin Dardragon (male halfling commoner), a curly-haired collector and reseller of paintings and statuettes of questionable taste.</p>
<p>The town is full of rumors about the disappearance of Oric and Lathna, siblings who were abducted by raiders from a homestead a short distance outside of town. (They are currently serving in the kitchens of Rivergard Keep.) Herivin Dardragon is also worried about one of his regulars, a female shield dwarf prospector named Wulgreda. She has not stopped by in a long time (and is a prisoner in the Temple of the Black Earth).</p>

<p>Recently, a roving band of Elk tribe barbarians (see &ldquo;The Uthgardt Tribes&rdquo; below) have come to Westwood. They forcibly evicted bandits from the innermost woodcutters camps, then camped there themselves to explore and hunt in Westwood.</p>
<h4 id=reason-to-visit-19>

Although characters will be hard-pressed to win the barbarians trust, they can pry useful information out of them. The Elk hunters know the Sumber Hills well and can provide simple, landmark-based directions to two cult strongholds: Rivergard Keep and Scarlet Moon Hall (though they don&rsquo;t know the names of these locations).</p>

It is also the local supply and market for the surrounding farms from which the grain comes. Aside from the mill, the village consists of a handful of granaries and a larger handful of cottages, several of which house tiny local shops. According to old tales, the village was known as Ironford until a dragon was slain nearby. Passers-by began to call the settlement &ldquo;Wyrm Ford,&rdquo; a name subsequently corrupted, thanks to the thick local accent, into &ldquo;Womford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Womford is a center of thinly disguised cult activity thanks to its location on the Dessarin. River pirates and smugglers allied to the water cult frequently put in at the towns dock. Ruffians and thugs seem to take over the village whenever a keelboat is tied up at the dock. In fact, some locals have thrown in with the smugglers-three young neer-do-wells named Gorm, Herek, and Shadnil sailed off a month ago to join up. (They are now servants in the kitchens of Rivergard Keep.)</p>
<p>Womforders lock and bar their doors and shutter their windows at night, for fear of the &ldquo;Womford Bat,&rdquo; a nocturnal predator that snatches folk it can catch outside after dark. One villager named Darreth vanished only steps from his own front door a tenday ago. (He was actually abducted by water cultists, and is now a captive in <strong>area F21</strong> of the Fane of the Eye.)</p>

A walled citadel on the west bank of the river connects to a bridge wide enough to accommodate two wagons with room to spare, connecting the Evermoor Way into and through Yartar. The road leads east to Everlund and Silverymoon, and west to Triboar and eventually Waterdeep via the Long Road.</p>
<p>Yartar is prosperous and increasingly crowded, so buildings have been torn down and taller ones built-four stories high in some instances.</p>
<p>A Waterbaron who rules for life leads Yartar. The current Waterbaron is the shrewd, farseeing Nestra Ruthiol (female Tethyrian human noble). Yartar is part of the Lords' Alliance, and Ruthiol considers that membership vital for its survival and prosperity. She knows that Harpers and Zhentarim are well established in the city, but her path only crosses with theirs when the wellbeing of Yartarrans is at stake.</p>
<p>The elemental cults have begun abducting Yartarrans who wont be missed-poor people and drunkards, mostly-and smuggling them out of the city. These missing Yartarrans are currently being held in <strong>area A12</strong> of the Temple of Howling Hatred (see chapter 4).</p>

More broadly, characters affiliated with the Lords' Alliance can readily receive support in Yartar, and Harpers and Zhentarim can get aid, too, if they&rsquo;re discreet and know how to contact an agent in town.</p>

They take their name from Uthgar, a great hero-chief who conquered much of the North many centuries ago before ascending to godhood. Each tribe venerates its own particular totem animal and protects its own sacred sites, known as ancestral mounds. Some Uthgardt are relatively settled and trade with the civilized folk of the area, while others are aggressive raiders who pillage any caravan or homestead they come across.</p>
<p>The major tribes in the vicinity of the Dessarin Valley include the Elk, Gray Wolf, Griffon, and Tree Ghost. The Gray Wolf and Griffon tribesfolk are known as fierce warriors, but they rarely wander as far south as the Sumber Hills. The Tree Ghosts are a reclusive band that roams the High Forest; the barbarians are sometimes seen in the vales between the Sumber Hills and the edge of the forest, but they are among the more peaceful tribes and rarely trouble settlers or travelers in this area.</p>
<p>Uthgardt of the Elk tribe regard most of the Dessarin Valley as their territory. Small bands of Elk warriors roam the Westwood, the Sumber Hills, and the hilly land around the Dessarin and Surbrin rivers. Because they are relatively few in number, the Elk barbarians stay well away from the cities and towns in the area. However, they often attack weakly defended caravans on remote trails that are far from help. The tribesfolk generally don&rsquo;t harass poor working folk such as homesteaders and shepherds, although they sometimes steal sheep or other livestock if the opportunity presents itself.</p>
