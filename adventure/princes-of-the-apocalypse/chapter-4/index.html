<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>In chapter 3, the characters succeeded in exposing some or all of the elemental cults surface outposts as nests of villainy. However, the Haunted Keeps represent only the tip of the iceberg. Each cults base of operations lies hidden deep beneath the Sumber Hills in the ancient dwarven redoubt of Tyar-Besil. Clearing the cultists out of the Haunted Keeps deals a sharp setback to the affected cults, but unless the characters follow up on their initial successes by infiltrating the temple complex, the cults recover quickly from their early defeats and return in greater force.</p>

Encourage the players to take on the challenges in this chapter in whatever order they wish-let their interests drive the story. If you want to pace the adventure, the Temple of Howling Hatred suits a 6th-level party; the Temple of the Crushing Wave is appropriate for a 7th-level party; the Temple of Black Earth is designed for an 8th-level group; and the Temple of Eternal Flame works best for a party of 9th-level characters. Each quarter of the dungeon cleared out by the characters should advance the party one level.</p>

While the characters are busy smashing one temple, the other three cults can do great harm in the area. Between expeditions to Tyar-Besil, the characters would be well advised to continue the investigations they began in chapter 3.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the natural disasters, monster incursions, and upswing in raider activity represent symptoms of a common disease: the presence of the Temple of Elemental Evil. No matter which disasters and events the characters choose to respond to, the solution to the regions woes lies in the great dungeon below the Sumber Hills.</p>
<h3 id=urgent-summons>
<a href=#urgent-summons class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Urgent Summons</h3><p>Early in this part of the adventure, one or more characters receive messages from their factions, asking for help with other dangers in the area. This opportunity allows you to introduce the players to one of the side treks described in chapter 6.</p>
<p>The summons could be a verbal message entrusted to an NPC waiting in the characters base town. A messenger might brave the wilds to find the characters at their campsite. Magic might be used, such as a sending spell. Whether the party chooses to respond or continue on their current course is up to the players.</p>
<h3 id=the-spys-letter>
<a href=#the-spys-letter class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Spys Letter</h3><p>The characters have a problem in Red Larch: Justran Daehl, the cellarer (ale buyer) of the Helm at Highsun, is a spy for the Cult of the Crushing Wave. He&rsquo;s been reporting on the partys comings and goings since they arrived in the region. Justran doesn&rsquo;t sign his letters, but if the characters find one of his reports in Rivergard or in the Temple of the Crushing Wave, they might be able to figure out who he is by looking for the author.</p>
<p>Most townsfolk don&rsquo;t recognize the handwriting, but those who do regular business with Justran and the Helm at Highsun can identify his script. These include Kaylessa (proprietor of the Swinging Sword Inn), Marlandro Gaelkur (of Gaelkurs), and Aerego Bethendur (the warehouse owner). If the characters show the letter to any of these individuals, the NPC identifies the handwriting. If the players say &ldquo;we show the letter to everyone in town,&rdquo; Justran hears about it and flees town before the characters corner him.</p>
<p>If confronted, Justran Daehl denies the charge vehemently. He claims that any letter the characters present as evidence is &ldquo;a clear forgery&rdquo; until he sees a chance to escape. The cult spy is equivalent to a bandit captain. If the encounter takes place at the Helm and the characters don&rsquo;t make a strong case against him, five commoners (tavern regulars) come to his defense. They aren&rsquo;t cult servants, just bystanders mistaken about Justran and trying to help the cellarer who keeps them in drink.</p>
<h4 id=poisoned-ale>
<a href=#poisoned-ale class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Poisoned Ale</h4><p>Justran might take it upon himself to eliminate the characters. When the characters gather for dinner one evening after they return to Red Larch, he arranges to serve them poisoned ale. This has the same effect as a potion of poison, but the characters have advantage on their saving throws because Justran has to dilute the poison among several flagons. (The dilution also makes the poison unlikely to be lethal; Justran is better at making ale than he is at making poison.)</p>
<p>A brief investigation reveals that the poisoned flagons came from the taproom of the Helm at Highsun, and Justran Daehl personally delivered and poured the ale.</p>
<h4 id=development>
<a href=#development class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Development</h4><p>If the characters capture Justran, he reveals after brief interrogation that he is a member of the Cult of the Crushing Wave. He knows that an underground stream at Rivergard Keep leads to &ldquo;the temple below,&rdquo; although he has never been to the Temple of the Crushing Wave. He also knows that Jolliver Grimjaw and his followers (see chapter 3) are water cultists.</p>
<h3 id=the-temple-of-elemental-evil>
<a href=#the-temple-of-elemental-evil class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Temple of Elemental Evil</h3><p>The four elemental cults maintain their chief stronghold in the ancient dwarven citadel of Tyar-Besil beneath the Sumber Hills. Each cult controls a portion of the old dwarven redoubt and has its own sanctum dedicated specifically to the element worshiped. These four temples are described in this chapter.</p>
<p>Several subterranean routes lead from buried Tyar-Besil to the surface. Knifepoint Gully near Feathergale Spire leads to the Temple of Howling Hatred. The Dark Stream flows under Rivergard Keep, leading to the Temple of the Crushing Wave. The Ancient Stair descends from Sacred Stone Monastery to the Temple of Black Earth. Finally, the Path of Frozen Fire leads from the cellars below Scarlet Moon Hall to the Temple of Eternal Flame. Each elemental cult controls one of these routes and therefore controls the quarter of Tyar-Besil that connects to the surface outpost.</p>
<h4 id=infiltrating-the-temples>
<a href=#infiltrating-the-temples class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Infiltrating the Temples</h4><p>Characters who dress in cultist gear might have some success infiltrating the temples. Each cults monstrous allies rarely challenge a group of cultists that proceeds with confidence. Human members of the cult have a good chance to spot impostors at close range, but fast-talking characters might be able to pass themselves off as new arrivals, bearers of important information, or potential allies against another cult. If the characters ask for a prophet or issue threats in the prophets name, they gain advantage on ability checks they make to bluff or intimidate their way into a temple. Fooled cultists insist on leading the party to one of the cults leaders. At least two cultists from any group the characters interact with serve as escorts.</p>
<h4 id=driving-the-cults-into-retreat>
<a href=#driving-the-cults-into-retreat class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Driving the Cults Into Retreat</h4><p>The cultists learn and adapt as the characters attack their strongholds. The four temple dungeons described in this chapter each include a room where that cults elemental prophet might be encountered. The first time the characters find their way to one these locations, the prophet is present, and the characters can engage their foe. After one prophet falls, the remaining three prophets retreat to lower levels, leaving their minions to defend the temple dungeons.</p>
<p>The characters defeat each dungeon when they kill its prophet or eliminate the monsters in the elemental shrine in these locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temple of Howling Hatred: <strong>area A19</strong></li>
<li>Temple of the Crushing Wave: <strong>area C25</strong></li>
<li>Temple of Black Earth: <strong>area B23</strong></li>
<li>Temple of Eternal Flame: <strong>area E17</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id=counterattack>
<a href=#counterattack class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Counterattack</h4><p>Its dangerous to linger in a stronghold without defeating that dungeons prophet. If the characters try to camp in any of the four temples while its elemental prophet is still alive, the prophet gathers reinforcements and sends them to attack the intruding party. The prophets can organize this strike even if they have retreated down to the Fane of the Eye or the elemental nodes-visions and whisperings from the Eye guide their actions. (However, there are a few specific areas called out within the temple levels where the characters might be able to rest without attracting attention.)</p>
<p>Groups sent up from lower levels of the dungeon include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air cult: Howling Hatred priest and four kenku</li>
<li>Water cult: Crushing Wave priest and four bugbears</li>
<li>Earth cult: Black Earth priest and two ogres</li>
<li>Fire cult: Eternal Flame priest and four hobgoblins</li>
</ul>
<p>See chapter 7 for each priests statistics.</p>
<p>Likewise, it isn&rsquo;t safe to camp in a cleared Haunted Keep. The elemental prophets divine the characters location and send forces to harass the party. Small bands of cult raiders and mercenaries roam the Sumber Hills, so its a simple matter to order one such group to attack the characters at one of the Haunted Keeps. (See the &ldquo;Random Encounters&rdquo; section in chapter 2.) To rest in safety, the characters must either hide their camp or return to a nearby settlement.</p>
<h2 id=cult-retaliation>
<a href=#cult-retaliation class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Cult Retaliation</h2><p>The eradication of one or more of the surface outposts of the elemental cults marks the characters as dangerous enemies. As the party continues the assault on cult strongholds in Tyar-Besil, the elemental prophets look for ways to hit back hard, using their devastation orbs.</p>
<p>The timing of these retaliatory encounters coincides with the partys progress in overcoming the four temple complexes. A temple is overcome when its prophet is defeated or the monsters in its shrine are eliminated.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the characters defeat the first prophet, run &ldquo;Dire Tidings&rdquo; when they return to a settlement.</li>
<li>After the characters force a second cult to abandon its shrine, run the &ldquo;Reckless Hate&rdquo; encounter when the party returns to a settlement.</li>
<li>After the characters force the third cult to abandon its shrine, run the &ldquo;Race to Destruction&rdquo; encounter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parties that stay in the dungeon and choose not to return to town might be oblivious to the villains retaliations. If the characters never leave, assume the cultists effort to destroy a town in &ldquo;Reckless Hate&rdquo; causes great damage without the characters on hand to stop it. When &ldquo;Race to Destruction&rdquo; is triggered, the characters receive a sending or similar warning from a faction NPC that a town is in great danger, providing them with a chance to stop the event.</p>
<h3 id=dire-tidings>
<a href=#dire-tidings class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Dire Tidings</h3><p>While the characters were busy in ruined Tyar-Besil, elemental cultists used a devastation orb to attack one of the towns in the area. The party learns the news when they arrive at any settlement in the Sumber Hills region. If the characters don&rsquo;t venture anywhere near civilization, NPCs the party meets in the wilderness deliver the news.</p>
<p>A caravaner tells the characters of seeing silent pilgrims on their way to the settlement in question. She describes the pilgrims garb well enough for the characters to know the pilgrims were elemental cultists. They carried a box, which had elemental symbols worked into it. The caravaner and her servants then witnessed the devastation but were too far away to lend any aid.</p>
<p>If the characters visit the wrecked town, they can confirm the scope of the damage. They learn from survivors that the cultists marched to the center of town, opened the box, took out an orb, and then ran for the hills, leaving the orb behind. The disaster happened scant minutes later. Many townspeople were injured, and the survivors are tending to the wounded in makeshift shelters.</p>
<h3 id=reckless-hate>
<a href=#reckless-hate class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Reckless Hate</h3><p>When the characters defeat a second elemental temple, the offended cult strikes back. Through divinations, spy reports, or visions bestowed by the Elder Elemental Eye, the cultists learn which settlement the player characters are using for a base and send a small force with a devastation orb to ravage that settlement-preferably with the characters in it. While the characters rest, trouble arrives on their doorstep.</p>
<p>If the characters make camp outside of town, this encounter occurs when the characters spot the cultist group traveling to a settlement they intend to attack. The cultists path brings them close to wherever the characters happen to be staying. For example, if the characters are camped out near one of the Haunted Keeps, they spot the group as it exits the passage connecting the keep to the dungeon levels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after sunrise the day after you arrive in town, you hear a commotion outside. Someone shouts, &ldquo;Hey, stop that!&rdquo; A moment later voices break into a low, strange chanting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters investigate, add the following information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several strangely dressed people stand in the street. One who looks like a priest chants as the others open a large box engraved with a recurring elemental symbol. Inside, a magical orb resembling a crystal ball pulses and thrums with power. The priest holds the orb aloft and continues to chant while the others kneel before it.</p>

<p>The object is a devastation orb, and its ready to explode. The cultists remove the device from its case and wait for it to detonate. See chapter 7 for descriptions of the devastation orbs and statistics for the cultists. The groups composition depends on which cult is involved:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your sleep is troubled this night. Half-remembered figments and warnings seem to hover in your mind. Then a shadowy figure strides into your minds eye and brushes aside your wandering thoughts. &ldquo;Hear me well, fool,&rdquo; it sneers. &ldquo;You have offended the Elder Elemental Eye. For your sacrilege, others shall be punished. At sunset the day after tomorrow, we will destroy the town of Beliard. You can try to stop us, but you will fail; none shall survive. This is the price of your defiance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new vista forms in your dream. You are standing on a hillside above a small town. A circle of shadowy cultists stands nearby, gazing at a glowing orb in the center of the circle. The orb pulses, and you awaken with a start.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The threat to Beliard is real. The cultists wait a couple of miles outside of town, staying out of sight until the specified time of the attack. If the characters search the outskirts of town, they can engage the cultists away from the target. Otherwise, the cultists march on the town with a devastation orb an hour before sunset. The group depends on which cult is involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two Feathergale knights mounted on hippogriffs, one skyweaver, one hurricane, and five bugbears</li>
<li>One Dark Tide knight mounted on a giant crocodile, one fathomer, one Crushing Wave priest, and six bandits</li>
<li>One burrowshark mounted on a bulette, and two Black Earth guards</li>
<li>Three Eternal Flame guardians, two minotaurs, and four hell hounds</li>
</ul>
<p>These cultists are willing to annihilate themselves in the process of carrying out their mission. The cultists are also under orders to make sure they catch the characters in the blast, so if they are intercepted away from town, they still try to set off the orb (see chapter 7).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An enormous chasm splits the earth as far as the eye can see in the pervasive subterranean darkness. A crude, narrow stairway hugs the rock alongside the chasm, twisting madly in hairpin turns around sharp outcroppings. Jagged and uneven, the stair threatens to spill travelers into the chasms mouth. After several treacherous miles, the stairway terminates on a broad, flat landing that juts out over the immense black chasm. In the gloom, a lost dwarven city lays in ruins beneath the glittering cavern vault. Broken statues stand in the midst of empty plazas, staring sightlessly into the darkness. A huge step pyramid rises at the edge of the precipice, and from the moat that surrounds it a misty waterfall whispers over the chasms ledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cult of the Howling Hatred established its temple in the southwest quarter of ancient Tyar-Besil, where the dwarves built a palace in a vast cavern upon the edge of a great chasm. Where the caverns glittering, mineral-encrusted ceiling rose high, the dwarves constructed spacious plazas in which they carved towering statues, elaborate pillars, and enormous monuments. They worked the natural stone of the cavern and carved barracks and other living quarters into the rock, connecting them via lamplit passageways. Though it was a fortress, some commerce and art was present, with a rudimentary bazaar and dwarven skalds filling the air with chanted verse. With the aid of a friendly djinni, the dwarves constructed a pyramid-shaped palace at the center of the cavern, surrounded by a moat fed by an underground stream. Dwarven innovation provided the cavern with light, fresh water, and sewage disposal.</p>

<p>The commoners are cultists on the brink of becoming initiates. The priests lash these cultists to break their will before final initiation into the cult.

<p>A cloaker that hunts in the old Tyar-Besil shops moved into the area as soon as a food source (the cult) arrived. Whenever the characters enter one of the shops, they have a twenty-five percent chance of encountering the cloaker. The creature is either disguised in plain sight as a cloak or hiding on the ceiling. The cloaker uses hit-and-run tactics against the characters, rather than risking itself in a drawn-out fight.</p>

<p>A deep moat surrounds a plaza consisting of a step pyramid encircled by a stone walkway. Stone colonnades to the north and east span the moat and connect the plaza to other parts of the ruined dwarven enclave. A short bridge spans the moat to the south. Holding up the bridge and colonnades are enormous statues of dwarves submerged up to their necks. Perched atop the pyramid and watching over the vault is a humanoid figure in a feathered cloak mounted on a large, draconic creature. The water in the moat flows west before plunging over a waterfall into a dark abyss. The sound of rushing water echoes like thunder within this vault, the ceiling of which glitters with mineral deposits like a perpetual starry night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A skyweaver (see chapter 7) named Kaz Hanar and his wyvern mount perch atop the pyramid, guarding the plaza. They swoop down to attack anyone who isn&rsquo;t dressed as an air cultist.</p>
<p>If the characters are disguised as air cultists, Kaz lands upon the nearest bridge or colonnade and asks them where they are going. Kaz doesn&rsquo;t care much about their answers; he&rsquo;s bored and looking for an excuse to exert his authority. If disguised, the characters must provide a halfway compelling story to convince Kaz to let them pass. If they fail to convince Kaz, he and his wyvern refuse to let them pass.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the vault is 75 feet above the walkway and roughly hewn. The step pyramid once served as the dwarven palace of Tyar-Besil. It has two levels (areas A18 and A19), and each level is 20 feet tall.</p>
<p>The pillared colonnade that spans the moat north of the plaza leads to <strong>area A7</strong>. A similar but longer colonnade to the east is described in <strong>area A17</strong>. The bridge to the south leads to <strong>area A16</strong>.</p>

<p>Ahtayir, a djinni in a torn vest and ragged pantaloons, labors here. His noble countenance bears a stoic expression as he carves a boulder with stone carving tools.</p>
<p>Torhild Flametongue, king of the Besilmer dwarves, possessed a horn that could summon Ahtayir once every one hundred and one years. By the power of the horn, the summoned djinni was obligated to complete a single service or task. The palace quarter of the dwarven city was partly constructed by the djinni.</p>
<p>When Aerisi Kalinoth discovered the horn, she commanded the djinni to restore the dwarven city to its former glory. Torhild tasked the djinni with the daunting task of keeping the palace quarter in good repair - a task he has been performing now for centuries.</p>
<p>When Aerisi Kalinoth arrived, she took possession of the horn but refused to free the djinni from his previously assigned task.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The obelisks are made of granite. They stand 15 feet tall and are 4 feet wide at the base.

Temple of Elemental Air</h3><blockquote>
<p>The stairs rise twenty feet to a spacious, twenty-foot-high chamber containing a map of an ancient dwarven realm meticulously etched into the flagstone floor. At the far end of the chamber, a high throne atop a marble dais overlooks all. Peaked arcades hung with gossamer sky-blue curtains run the length of the chamber on either side. From behind these a heady incense wafts, its sweet smoke moving like a creature of air.</p>
<p>Behind the high throne, a great spiraling horn rests in an alcove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chamber once served as a seat of power for the dwarf king of Besilmer and his war council. Engraved on the floor is a map of the ancient dwarven kingdom. The air cult has turned it into a den of vice and depravity. If this is the first of the elemental temples the characters explore, the air prophet Aerisi Kalinoth sits upon the high throne overseeing her court, her illusory wings gently fanning the air. She keeps her magic spear, <wc-fetch type=item>Windvane</wc-fetch> (see chapter 7), close to her at all times. If Aerisi is here, her ever-watchful invisible stalker companion, Whisper, glides through the chamber unseen. If he escaped from <strong>area A4</strong>, Windharrow is here as well, kneeling or sitting at Aerisis feet. Ten howling hatred initiate lay drugged behind the curtains that hang between the pillars to the north and south. Aerisi can command them to attack intruders, but they are effectively poisoned. See chapter 7 for the cultists statistics.</p>
<p>If Aerisi isn&rsquo;t here, a vrock, whose service was a gift from a demonic envoy, guards the temple alone. It lurks behind the throne and attacks any non-cultists that enter the hall. The drug-addled initiates don&rsquo;t aid the vrock and fight only in self-defense.</p>

She is oblivious to compassion or kindness unless such gestures are directed her way. She sees ordinary mortals as expendable, weak-willed toys and has brought many individuals to the Cult of the Howling Hatred by seducing them with her powers of enchantment. She&rsquo;s obsessed with the avariel (winged elves), so she has given herself illusory wings so she can pretend to be one.</p>
<p>She knows about the characters and their exploits, but her pride doesn&rsquo;t permit her to view them as a threat. If they accuse her of malfeasance, she tells the characters that the Cult of the Black Earth is trying to frame her followers by posing as air cultists, hoping to trick the characters into going after her hated rival. If the characters seem eager to fight the earth cultists, Aerisi grants them safe passage from her territory.</p>
<p>If seriously opposed, Aerisi uses an action to blow the horn (see below). The djinni Ahtayir (<strong>area A15</strong>) arrives at the end of Aerisis next turn. She orders the djinni to cover her escape and flies down the shaft in <strong>area A18</strong>.</p>

<a href=#horn class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Horn</h4><p>Etchings of cloudy landscapes encircle the horn, where a pyramid palace seems to float upon a cloud bank among groves of palm, fig, and date trees. Blowing the horn calls forth the djinni Ahtayir, who must then perform a single task for the one who summoned him. Once that task is complete, Ahtayir is free to return to his estate on the Elemental Plane of Air and cant be summoned again in this manner for one hundred and one years. The horn can be sundered by a single hit from a weapon that deals 10 damage or more. If the horn is sundered, Ahtayir can no longer be summoned by it.</p>

<p>The dead worm is all that remains of a purple worm killed by dwarves. The bones of several dead dwarves lie where the worms gullet used to be. Characters can climb through the skeleton to access the tunnel it left behind. The tunnel is 10 feet wide and leads down to <strong>area F1</strong> in the Fane of the Eye (see chapter 5).</p>

Long ago, this portion of Tyar-Besil contained storehouses. The Dark Stream provided a safe, navigable waterway linking the stronghold with the Dessarin River and the surface dominions of the realm.</p>
<p>Gar Shatterkeel, the Prophet of Water, instructed his followers to claim as much of the quarter as they could and to entice monsters friendly to the cults cause to establish lairs nearby.</p>

The stream originates from a large spring in this part of the ancient dwarven stronghold. It flows through tunnels and caverns for about 2 miles before passing under Rivergard Keep and emptying into the Dessarin River. The stream is sluggish, and it isn&rsquo;t hard to row or pole a boat against the current.</p>
<p>Random Encounters. Each time the characters travel the Dark Stream to or from the Temple of the Crushing Wave, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> for a random encounter at some point during the underground voyage.</p>
<p>Darkmantles and piercers drop from the tunnel ceiling into the boat. Troglodytes hurl javelins from the shore where the Dark Stream passes through an open cavern. Water weirds and chuuls lurk in the stream and attack from the water.</p>

No locks remain operable, but the cultists secure some doors with a hasp-and-pin closure. Characters can force open such doors with a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p>
<p>Double doors have iron hinges and swing open in one direction or the other, like normal doors.</p>

The canals are 15 feet deep. A sluggish current flows southward down both canals from the waterfalls at <strong>area C25</strong>.</p>
<p>A character who falls into a canal finds that the sides are smooth and slippery. It is very hard to cling to the wall or to climb out, unless a quay is nearby.</p>

Lake Landing</h3><p>If the characters arrive by boat from the stream, read the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firelight shines from a large cavern ahead. The stream opens into a large underground lake. To the right, a crumbling stone quay leads to a tunnel heading northeast. A ten-foot skiff is moored to the quay, and a torch burns in a bronze sconce by the tunnel mouth. Beside the quay, a twenty-foot wide canal leads north from the large lake. The lake stretches westward into darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters find their way here from other parts of the dungeon, read the following text instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The passage opens into a large, dark cavern filled by a subterranean lake. At the east end of the lake, a torch illuminates a stone quay with a ten-foot skiff tied up alongside it. The west end of the lake disappears into darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quay leading to <strong>area C4</strong> might or might not be visible, depending on which direction the party approaches from. It isn&rsquo;t illuminated and hard to see in the darkness.</p>
<p>The landing at the east end of the cavern is guarded by four crushing wave reaver and one fathomer commanded by a Dark Tide knight named Eyon (see chapter 7 for the cultists statistics). Eyons mount, a hunter shark, swims in the lake nearby. The cultists challenge any strange boats that approach from the east and attack unless the characters convince them to parley.</p>

She is a hard-bitten, callous mercenary who expects only the worst from people. The instant Eyon decides the characters are trying to string her along, she orders her reavers to attack.</p>
<p>The reavers know that most enemies are at a serious disadvantage in the water. If they attack an enemy standing on the edge of the quay or on a boat, reavers attempt to use the &ldquo;Shoving a Creature&rdquo; special attack to push a character into the water. (The water is 15 feet deep near the quay.) Eyon prefers to fight from the water while mounted on her shark, using her lance against enemies in a boat or at the waters edge.

<p>Torches positioned near the bridges at areas C6, C15, and C24 provide illumination; from just about any point the characters find the canal, they can see one of the bridge torches.</p>
<p>The dwarves of Besilmer built the canal to channel the spring in <strong>area C26</strong> away from their delvings and link their citys mercantile district with the world above. The water is 15 feet deep. A character can pole a boat through a canal at a speed of 10 feet.</p>

Whisper Lake</h3><blockquote>
<p>This underground lake is dark, still, and cold. To the west, the lake ends at a gravel shore, and a faint glimmer of torchlight hints at a channel or canal to the north. To the south, a crumbling stone quay leads to a dark passageway. At the east end of the lake, another torch burns above a larger quay, with another passageway leading east. A second canal leads north from the eastern portion of the lake, and the glimmer of light comes from that direction, as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ceiling of this cavern is a dome, at its highest point almost 50 feet above the water. The lake is 20 feet deep near the cavern walls, dropping to 60 feet in the middle. The lake earns its name from a trick of acoustics. A mere whisper spoken in <strong>area C1</strong> can easily be heard in <strong>area C19</strong>, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The lake is home to small blind cave fish. A giant octopus lurks in a grotto to the south, behind a column of rock that supports the cavern ceiling. The creature attacks swimmers or boaters who approach within 30 feet of its lair.</p>

Drowning Chambers</h3><blockquote>
<p>A dank, rotten smell pervades this chamber. The floor is perforated by eight small pools, each about 3 feet wide and filled to the brim with black, stinking water. Several large stones lie on the floor near the pools, each wrapped several times around by lengths of old rope. A symbol is painted on the southern wall-a shape like an X with the bottom limbs linked by a horizontal line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long ago this chamber served as the harbormasters post, but the Crushing Wave cult rededicated it as a place to ceremonially drown captives. Each of the pools is 10 feet deep. The stones average about 50 pounds, and the ropes are used to bind a victims feet together before pushing him or her into the pool.</p>
<p>Twelve aquatic ghoul (which have a swimming speed of 30 feet) lurk in this chamber-previous victims of the cults obscene rite. Eight are submerged in the pools where they died, and four more skulk in the shadows of the ruined enclosure at the west end of the room. The monsters hide so they can surprise intruders.</p>
<p>If the ghouls succeed in paralyzing a character, the nearest one uses an action to tie one of the heavy stones to the paralyzed characters feet. On the following turn, the ghoul shoves the paralyzed character into one of the drowning pools. Swimming to the surface with a tethered stone requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, and wriggling free of the tether in the confined space requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p>

Gaol</h3><p>An iron hasp-and-pin arrangement secures the door to this room. The lock cant be reached from inside but is easy to undo from the corridor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room evidently serves as a prison. A half-dozen straw pallets covered by threadbare blankets are spread out on the floor, and a cask of water leans against one wall. A dark, slit-like window looks out to the west.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cultists currently hold no prisoners in this makeshift jail. If the characters are defeated in the temple, they are stripped of their gear and confined here while Gar Shatterkeel decides how best to dispose of them.</p>

Victory Bridge</h3><p>The stairs on each side of the canal climb 10 feet from the quays, so the bridge is 15 feet above the water level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stone bridge spans the canal in a single elegant arch. Steps on each side climb up to the bridge. The bridge has a low stone balustrade, and its weathered sides are carved with images of dwarven battles. A single torch burns at the apex of the bridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bridge was elevated well above the water so that the dwarves who built this level could move large boats and barges freely up and down the canal.</p>

<p>Cultists in this room are usually off-duty and might be asleep; roll <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> to see how many cultists are in their bunks. Sounds of fighting nearby rouse the sleeping cultists, who join the fray on their turns during the third round of combat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This stone door has an iron plate about one foot square set in its middle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each door has a small square hole covered with a sliding iron plate. The cultists in the room (see below) use the holes to make crossbow attacks at intruders in the hallways. Opening or closing a hole cover requires an action. Normally one cultist operates the hole cover while another shoots. Only one cultist can shoot out of a hole at a time.</p>
<p>Read the following if the characters enter or peer into the room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room is bunk room and guard post. Sturdy bronze hasps are fitted to the two stone doors, and each door features a loophole covered by a small iron plate at chest level on a human. A round table and four rickety wooden chairs stand in the middle of the room. There are ten bunks here, although half of them don&rsquo;t appear to be in use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guard post is manned by a one-eyed shiver named Khalt, a Dark Tide knight named Gordol, and three crushing wave reaver (see chapter 7 for all). Khalt is in charge, and he runs a tight ship. These reavers are armed with light crossbows instead of javelins (+4 to hit, <wc-roll>1d8+2</wc-roll> piercing damage), and Gordol also has a light crossbow (+7 to hit, <wc-roll>1d8+3</wc-roll> piercing damage).</p>

<p>This chamber has been badly damaged. Several collapsed columns and buckling walls speak to the passage of many long years, but one feature remains curiously intact: a stone fountain in the middle of the west wall.

</blockquote>
<p>Two nothic occupy the room, hiding behind the broken columns and rubble choking the eastern part of the chamber. The nothics took up residence here in the hopes that unwary cult members might be easy prey for an ambush or unwittingly yield secrets of power to the monsters weird insight.

Court of the Merfolk</h3><blockquote>
<p>An ancient fountain shaped like three dancing merfolk stands in the middle of this court. The fountain is dry, and the sculpture has been badly damaged-two of the merfolk are missing their arms, and the third is missing her head. Hallways lead north, south, and east from this chamber. A glimmer of torchlight comes from the north, and another glimmer to the east.</p>
<p>A door to the northwest is covered with painted glyphs and images with aquatic motifs, marred by long scratches that obscure their meaning.</p>

<p>The ceiling in this chamber is 30 feet high. Vandalism to the decorations on the northwestern door is the handiwork of Thuluna Maah, a sea hag in <strong>area C14</strong>.</p>

<p>This room is filthy. The walls are crumbling and crooked, and the heaps of uncured pelts and hides strewn across the floor form a crude, foul-smelling carpet. Gnawed bones and broken crockery are scattered about, along with a few odd pieces of armor, most bent, twisted, or badly scored by claw marks. Doors lead to the north and the west.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room is the lair of three aquatic troll, which have a swimming speed of 40 feet and the ability to breathe underwater. Only two are here, since one troll guards <strong>area C15</strong> at any given time.</p>
<p>The trolls-named Gorgebelly, Marrowsucker, and Ninetooth-ignore goings-on in the dungeon around them, and they grudgingly answer any summons for help. Characters disguised as water cultists, or characters who insist they are doing the cults business, can easily convince the trolls to stay here and do nothing, or bribe them to cause trouble somewhere else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This room is filled with a rank reptilian smell and cluttered with tattered animal hides and dank straw. A battered iron brazier brimming with hot embers glows in the middle of the room. Half-gnawed carcasses heaped beside the brazier attest to an indifferent effort to cook them over the coals. There are two doors: one north and one south.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the den of a band of lizardfolk who call themselves the Blackmaws. These creatures have degenerated into savagery despite their use of human-style arms and armor. The carcasses by the brazier include the remains of a fire cultist spy caught skulking in the area a few days ago.</p>
<p>Eight lizardfolk are here now, including the leader of the tribe, a warrior with 36 hit points named Tornscale. They are armed with javelins, maces, and shields. Five more lizardfolk lurk around <strong>area C25</strong>, keeping guard. Tornscale and its followers are loyal to the sea hag Thuluna Maah (<strong>area C14</strong>). They hate and resent the human members of the cult. If the characters are disguised as water cultists when they venture into this area, the Blackmaws are outraged by the invasion of their privacy and attack just as ferociously as they would attack the cults enemies.</p>
<p>If the lizardfolk lose at least two of their number in a fight here, Tornscale sends one of the remaining warriors to warn Thuluna and summon help.</p>

<p>Fine wooden furniture, tapestries of green and gold, and a bearskin carpet decorate this richly appointed room-but the furniture has been scratched up, the tapestries badly torn, and the carpet rent with foot-long holes. To the northwest, a tattered green curtain screens off a large alcove. Two large heaps of dank pelts lie in the southern part of the chamber. A wet reek like rotten seaweed hangs in the air, and small crabs scuttle around the room.</p>

<p>A sea hag named Thuluna Maah and two ogre that serve as her bodyguards live in this room. The two ogres stand watch in the outer portion of the room, while Thuluna lurks behind the curtain in the northwest alcove, her personal bedchamber.

She is a sly, calculating creature, quick to offer bargains and make deals that she can later turn to her advantage. The hag wields great influence over the cults nonhuman members, mostly because the ogres and trolls do anything she tells them to. Thuluna would like to unseat Shatterkeel and purge the cult of its human fathomers and one-eyed shivers, but she is patient. For now, she tries to convince Shatterkeel to strike against the rival cults, hoping that the air or fire cultists kill him for her and clear the way for her to take over the Crushing Wave cult.</p>
<p>If she knows a fight is coming, Thuluna grabs the potions out of her wooden chest. She hates beauty, so she targets the best-looking character. If the fight goes against her, she pleads for mercy and offers to show the characters a great treasure if they spare her. Thuluna then leads them to Bronzefumes lair in <strong>area C21</strong>.</p>

<p>One aquatic troll from <strong>area C12</strong> lurks in the canal underneath the bridge, keeping watch for intruders. The troll surfaces to challenge anyone moving through the area by boat or attempting to cross the bridge. It can be fooled by almost any claim that sounds remotely plausible, although it attacks any intruders who look like they expect a fight. If the characters are in a boat, the troll begins the battle by trying to capsize the vessel, which requires an action and a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>

<p>Most of the vats are empty, but three currently hold water weird drained from the three empty weird tanks (see chapter 7) stacked on the floor.

<p>Parts of this chamber are buried in piles of crumbling masonry, but enough remains intact to serve as an arcane workshop. A long wooden table in the middle of the room is littered with pieces of a complicated apparatus involving a large glass tank, copper fittings and piping, and a leather carrying harness, while shelves full of alchemical reagents stand against the south wall. The air is quite cold in here, and a chill mist clings to the floor. A large adjoining room to the north looks like someones bedchamber.</p>
<p>Doors lead out to the south and the east, and another door leads east from the bedchamber area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A one-eyed shiver named Morbeoth makes his home in these rooms. He commands the western portion of the temple and defends it against incursions from the Howling Hatred cultists. Prepared for battle, he carries a potion of gaseous form and a potion of healing. Three crushing wave reaver serve as his personal guards.</p>
<p>Morbeoth has experimented with devices that rely on elemental power. The device on the table is a disassembled <wc-fetch type=item>weird tank</wc-fetch> (see chapter 7). A character with proficiency in Arcana who makes a careful study of the workshop and the stored ingredients can determine that items powered by the energy of elemental water are assembled here.</p>

He especially resents the fact that a mere druid was chosen to serve as the Prophet of Water, and that an ugly monster like a sea hag serves as the cults second-in-command. Given the opportunity, he would steer a group of meddling adventurers into Thuluna Maahs territory (<strong>area C14</strong>), let them fight and kill her, then sweep in from behind to eliminate the adventurers and claim a great victory for the Crushing Wave cult.</p>

<p>Three old boats wait by the shore. They are far newer than the rest of the dungeon, having been left here less than a hundred years ago by a previous band of explorers. One is in good enough shape that it could be repaired with an hours work by stripping planks off the other boats. Any sustained activity in this area attracts the attention of the giant octopus that lives in <strong>area C3</strong>. The monster can haul itself up onto the shore in search of a tasty-looking meal.</p>

Starry Lake</h3><blockquote>
<p>A pale glimmer plays over the waters of this subterranean lake. The cavern ceiling is naturally formed and speckled with hundreds of tiny points of blue light, mimicking a starry night. The canal that runs through this lake continues north and south. To the east, a wide quay at the end of the lake leads to a large hall with red pillars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ceiling is 50 feet above water level. Its &ldquo;stars&rdquo; are small patches of luminescent lichen. Each patch is an inch in diameter and one-tenth as bright as a candle. If removed, a lichens glow persists for <wc-roll>1d3</wc-roll> days.</p>
<p>The lake averages 40 feet deep, shallowing to 10 feet near the east end. It houses the strongest monster in the Crushing Wave cult: a dragon turtle with 220 hit points named Bronzefume. Young and impressionable, she was lured to the Temple of the Crushing Wave by Gar Shatterkeels offer of riches. Bronzefume stays out of sight in the western end of the lake, waiting for the water prophet to decide the time is right to seize control of the river. Due to her reduced hit points, Bronzefume has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP).</p>
<p>If a boat ventures into her half of the lake, Bronzefume surfaces to investigate. She also answers if the gong in <strong>area C22</strong> is struck. The dragon turtle attacks only if she&rsquo;s sure those she meets are intruders, such as if she sees water cultists fighting the characters.</p>
<p>Bronzefume prefers to attack boats rather than people. Given a choice between attacking a character and damaging a boat that character is on, she opts for the boat. Destroying a small skiff takes up her actions for <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> rounds, during which she ignores characters who retreat.</p>

<p>Six tall columns of cracked and chipped red marble loom over this hall, which lies east of an underground lake. Provisions and trade goods are stacked against the walls: bundles of valuable furs and pelts, sacks of flour and meal, barrels of salted meat and ale, casks of oil, and more. Three long tables with benches are set up in the middle of the room, and a large bronze gong stands on the stone quay at the lake edge. A single torch burns in a sconce on one of the rooms middle pillars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crushing Wave cult is hoarding supplies and trade goods here. Much of the riverboat cargo thats gone missing on the Dessarin River in the last few months can be found in this hall.</p>
<p>The first time the characters visit, one fathomer (see chapter 7) and three cultist are here, sorting through the newest pile of looted cargo. The sounds of fighting here alerts the lizardfolk in <strong>area C13</strong> or the cultists in <strong>area C23</strong>, who investigate soon after fighting begins.</p>
<p>If faced with a dangerous band of attackers, the cultists attempt to reach the gong. Striking the gong summons Bronzefume from <strong>area C21</strong>. She surfaces by the quay on her turn 3 rounds after the gong sounds, then joins the fight.</p>

<p>This area serves as the kitchen for the Crushing Wave temple. The cultists prepare their meals here and dine at the tables in <strong>area C22</strong>. When the characters arrive, two crushing wave reaver (see chapter 7) and four cultist are here. If the hour is late, most are asleep in their bunks, but one or two cultists attend to chores such as baking or cleaning regardless of the time.

<p>The mark on the door is the water cults symbol. The doors leading to <strong>area C25</strong> are unlocked but protected by a <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch>. Any creature that opens either door without first making the hand sign of the water cult (an &ldquo;X&rdquo; of the forefingers, with thumbs overlapping) triggers the trap. A character searching the door for a trap finds the glyph with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check. The glyph deals <wc-roll>5d8</wc-roll> thunder damage on a failed DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or half as much damage on a successful one.

Temple of Elemental Water</h3><p>A glyph of warding (see <strong>area C24</strong>) protects the double doors at the south end of the room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A twenty-foot-wide moat divides this shrine into northern and southern halves. In the north half, two large stone pillars flank an altar in the form of a plain stone block. A few coins lie on the altar. Above and behind the altar looms a huge symbol made from beams of driftwood, fixed in an X-like shape on the wall. A single stone door leads westward from this part of the room.</p>
<p>In the southern half of the room, two ten-foot-wide channels run along the east and west walls of the shrine, spilling out through low culverts to the south. Two more pillars stand here, and a low stone bridge leads across the dividing channel to the altar and the northern part of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moat is 10 feet deep, and the water level is almost even with the floor. However, the smaller spillways that carry water south to the culverts are only 2 feet deep. In the middle of the eastern wall, a submerged culvert leads to <strong>area C26</strong>.</p>
<p>This shrine was once dedicated to dwarven gods, but the Crushing Wave cultists rededicated it to Olhydra. Five lizardfolk warriors of the Blackmaw tribe stand guard in the southern part of the shrine.</p>
<p>If this is the first elemental temple the characters explore, they find Gar Shatterkeel (see chapter 7) here, standing next to the altar in the northern part of the room. Otherwise, he has retreated down to the Fane of the Eye (see chapter 5). In that case, a <strong>hezrou demon</strong> is on guard with the lizardfolk. The demon lurks in the deep moat in the middle of the shrine.</p>

He despises most people and believes that even his most reliable followers are likely to fail him through weakness or treachery. Shatterkeel knows the characters aren&rsquo;t members of the cult and aren&rsquo;t here to join up, so he questions them tersely: &ldquo;Who are you? What do you want? Why shouldnt I drown you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shatterkeel hears out those who claim to bring news or gifts, and he might be persuaded to let them go if they seem intent on attacking one of the other cults.

<blockquote>
<p>A clear, deep spring fills most of this natural cavern. A dry ledge makes up part of the south side of the chamber.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pool is almost 80 feet deep and fed by an aquifer through porous rock at the bottom. It is the source of the Dark Stream, and it fills the canals and lakes on this level. Its inaccessibility makes it an ideal place for Gar Shatterkeel to hoard the better part of the water cults treasure. He is beyond such cares, but he realizes that wealth is a motivation for some who aren&rsquo;t entirely committed to the tenets of the Crushing Wave cult.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This room serves as the personal quarters of the cult priests: two crushing wave priest (see chapter 7) and four cultist. The priests see themselves as the most important members of the cult, and they make sure to look after their creature comforts. They intermittently take care of the Temple of Elemental Water.</p>
<p>On the rare occasions when Gar Shatterkeel retires to rest for a few hours, he sleeps here. Otherwise, he is found in <strong>area C25</strong>, attempting to discern the will of Olhydra or instructing others in the lore and philosophy of the cult.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The stairway leads down to <strong>area F6</strong> of the Fane of the Eye (see chapter 5).</p>
<p>The Crushing Wave cultists summoned a mezzoloth and ordered it to destroy any intruders seeking to use the stairs. To determine whether someone is an intruder, the mezzoloth asks three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you serve? The answer should be &ldquo;Olhydra,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Princess of Evil Water,&rdquo; or &ldquo;water.&rdquo;</li>
<li>What are you? The proper answer is &ldquo;I am nothing.&rdquo;</li>
<li>What lies below? The correct answer is &ldquo;the Fane of the Eye&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Elder Elemental Eye.&rdquo;</li>

Surviving cultists abandon this level, although some monsters might remain. A few cultists retreat to the Fane of the Eye or the Plunging Torrents, while others flee the temple altogether. If Thuluna or Morbeoth remain after the characters leave Crushing Wave territory, the cultists reorganize their defenses to fight off any other incursion.</p>

Long ago, this area served as Tyar-Besils main entrance, a well-fortified gate complex with barracks, guardrooms, armories, and stables. Enemies that managed to fight their way down the Ancient Stair from the surface above were stopped in their tracks by the daunting defenses of the gate quarter. More than one reckless attack by orcs, trolls, or giants was driven back from the gate,. In time, those savage foes found other ways to attack the dwarves of the Sumber Hills, and the stronghold was finally abandoned. The gates of Tyar-Besil lie in ruin now, broken not by the siege engines of enemies but instead by the tremors produced by the nearby elemental node.</p>
<p>Unlike the members of the other three cults, the Black Earth cultists have easy access to the surface. This quarter of the temple complex lies almost directly underneath the Sacred Stone Monastery, linked by the Ancient Stair. Earth cult raiders can strike at the surrounding settlements and retreat to the safety of the Black Earth temple with ease. Marlos Urnrayle, the Prophet of Earth, chose the long-wrecked fortifications of Tyar-Besil as the headquarters of his cult for this very reason.</p>

<p>The passage leads to a subterranean chasm spanned by a zigzagging, ten-foot-wide stone bridge without railings. The bridge links tunnels leading north and south. The chasm floor is fifty feet below the bridge and consists of a jumbled mass of boulders. To the west, the chasm narrows and continues for some distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three gargoyle guard the area, lurking on ledges in the shadowy upper reaches of this cavern, the ceiling of which is 50 feet higher than the bridge and 100 feet above the cavern floor. Characters with torches or darkvision spot the gargoyles if they have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher. The gargoyles ignore groups exiting the Temple of Black Earth. They attack any strangers approaching from the north unless the strangers pause at the bridge to either give the hand sign of the cult (a triangle formed with thumbs and forefingers of both hands) or call out, &ldquo;I serve the Black Earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In combat, the gargoyles look for opportunities to push characters off the bridge. If two gargoyles are defeated, the third retreats, flying to <strong>area B2</strong> to hide.</p>

North Chasm</h3><p>This cavernous area is 100 feet high from floor to ceiling. If the characters enter from the east (via <strong>area B1</strong>), read the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The floor of this large cavern is a broken jumble of stone, with steep walls slanting up to a ceiling of hanging stalactites perhaps a hundred feet above. Fifty feet up the jagged walls are two openings: a wider opening to the southwest and a narrow tunnel leading southeast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters are standing on the ledge at <strong>area B6</strong> or B21, use the following text instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the ledge lies a cavern with a ceiling of hanging stalactites fifty feet overhead and a rubble-strewn floor fifty feet below. Five feet below you, a narrow ledge hugs the wall, wrapping nearly halfway around the cavern.</p>

<p>Marlos Urnrayle used stone shape spells to create a narrow ledge that hugs the walls of the cavern. This ledge isn&rsquo;t visible from the cavern floor, and it starts 5 feet below the ledge leading to <strong>area B6</strong> and ends at an arrow slit, beyond which lies <strong>area B22</strong>. The arrow slit is 4 feet tall but only 6 inches wide.</p>

<p>A massive pair of stone doors lies broken just south of this small plaza, flanking by iron torches that brightly illuminate the area. One door lists unevenly on its bottom hinge, and the other lies shattered on the ground. The standing door is carved with a pastoral scene of grain fields and rolling hills, worn and pitted by the centuries. A large, dimly lit hall waits beyond the broken gates. Arrow slits are carved into the west and east walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was formerly the front gate of the stronghold of Tyar-Besil, but many years ago an earthquake finished the destruction begun by orcs and giants. The ceiling here is 30 feet high, and the gate stands 15 feet tall. Marlos Urnrayle intends to repair it, but he has not yet found anyone sufficiently skilled to do the work.</p>

<p>This was once a magnificent hall with a soaring ceiling, marble floors, and intricate carvings of prosperous farmlands decorating the walls. It has since fallen to ruin. Deep cracks mar the walls, sections of the masonry have collapsed, and the huge stone doors at the north end of the hall are broken. Passages lead west and south, and there is a stone door to the east. A small cooking fire and several bedrolls are in the southeast corner of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same earth tremors that shattered the gate marred the walls and floors with cracks, and patches of the 30-foot-high ceiling have fallen as well.</p>
<p>Four hobgoblin, a burrowshark named Nartham (see chapter 7), and Narthams bulette mount guard the Hall of the Gate. Nartham is a violent, short-tempered fellow. If the characters attempt to talk their way into the temple, they need to talk fast, because Nartham craves an excuse to kill.</p>
<p>The cooking fire and bedrolls belong to the hobgoblins, who have not yet been allocated better quarters in the temple. They hang back and pelt the characters with arrows while Nartham and his bulette tear into the party. The hobgoblins are mercenaries, hoping to earn enough loot to return to their tribe and take it over.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This guardroom serves as the barracks and post of four duergar in the service of the Black Earth cult. The gray dwarves don&rsquo;t keep a close watch from the arrow slit to the north, since they know that the gargoyles in <strong>area B1</strong> and Narthams guards in <strong>area B4</strong> stand watch.</p>

<p>A large pile of rubble from a partially collapsed wall fills the southeast corner of this guardroom, while a narrow fissure mars the wall to the north. Despite these failings, the room serves as a barracks and guardroom. Four plain wooden bunks are arrayed around the room, each with a small footlocker. At the back of an alcove in the northeast wall is an arrow slit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room served as a guardroom for the Hall of the Gate, but tremors collapsed the doorway that once linked the two rooms and formed the tunnel leading to <strong>area B2</strong>. A stonemelder named Yarsha and her two black earth guard (see chapter 7 for both) dwell here. In addition to normal gear, Yarsha carries a potion of greater healing, and the guards have light crossbows (+3 to hit, <wc-roll>1d8</wc-roll> piercing damage) if they need to defend <strong>area B3</strong>, but they don&rsquo;t keep a watch posted at the arrow slit.</p>
<p>Yarsha is murderous, and she has set her sights on assassinating Miraj Vizann and taking his place as the cults second-in-command. If she and her guards are on the verge of defeat, she turns on her own guards and finishes them off so she can try to strike a deal with the characters. Yarsha tells the party that Miraj is the earth prophet, and where they can find him (<strong>area B8</strong>). She asks nothing for herself other than a temporary truce.</p>

In addition, the cultists currently on duty in <strong>area B20</strong> have bunks in this room.</p>
<p>The cultists keep odd hours, and at any given time <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> are sacked out in their bunks. At least two of the residents are awake even in the middle of the night.

<p>The interior of the chamber can be described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Large stone statues carved to look like scowling dwarf warriors line the walls of this large chamber. Each statue has spiky maces in place of hands. However, several of the statues are melted or deformed. The flagstones in the middle of the room have been removed to reveal a surface of natural rock. Several worktables and shelves full of alchemical reagents are tucked up against the walls between the statues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the lair and workroom of Miraj Vizann (see chapter 7), an earth genasi and second in command of the Cult of the Black Earth. The statues were once animated constructs, though the magic that powered them faded long ago. Miraj managed to reactivate two of the stone warriors. One now stands watch in <strong>area B24</strong>, and the other is here. The ancient construct is equivalent to a stone golem with 102 hit points and no Multiattack action (challenge rating 4 instead of 8).</p>

He supports the cult because it deepens his understanding of elemental magic. If challenged, he attempts to persuade his attackers to turn their efforts against the fire cult. Miraj isn&rsquo;t above offering a bribe to entice enemies, then reneging on the deal if they come back to collect.</p>
<p>Miraj calls himself a &ldquo;mud sorcerer&rdquo; because he practices earth and water magic, and he reveres both OgrÃ©moch and Olhydra. He bears the water cultists no ill will and sometimes acts as an advocate or emissary on their behalf.</p>
<p>In battle, Miraj commands the golem to defend him. He then retreats to the back of the room to cast spells. Miraj turns invisible and flees if death seems imminent.</p>
<p>The worktables and shelves hold common alchemical ingredients and notebooks, including unusual mineral salts and solutions. The notes indicate that the melted statues are golems that Miraj experimented on without success.</p>

<p>Some long-ago, a seismic event devastated this great hall. A deep chasm splits the chamber in two, leaving a wide gap between the rooms northern and southern halves. Freestanding pillars of rock to the east create natural &ldquo;stepping stones&rdquo; across the chasm. The chasm continues beyond the west wall, and a narrow ledge hugs the south wall of the expanse. Six huge stone pillars still stand in this chamber, and the ceiling here is almost fifty feet high. Each of the pillars anchors heavy iron chains with links as big as a warriors hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The warriors of Tyar-Besil assembled here to practice with arms. The Cult of the Black Earth now uses the room as a stable for their prized mounts: three bulettes. One belongs to Dynath in <strong>area B7</strong>. The other two were recently caught and haven&rsquo;t yet been broken. The bulettes are being held here until the monsters can be bonded with cultists.</p>
<p>Each bulette is chained securely to one of the big pillars in the room (the northeast, center west, and southeast pillars, specifically). The chains keep the bulette within 15 feet of the pillars, but they can move freely otherwise. The bulettes spend most of their time dozing, but they are light sleepers.

Characters close to that end of the chasm also see a ruddy red glow playing on the walls nearby. Explorers that carry bright lights in this area might be noticed by the creatures in B15.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This long chasm stretches northwest to southeast. A five-foot-wide ledge clings to one wall, then forms a narrow stone bridge that spans the chasm and connects to a similar ledge that runs along the opposite wall.</p>

<p>The ledges and stone bridge are 100 feet above the chasm floor and 100 feet below the chasm roof. <strong>area B15</strong> is visible from the bridge and at the same level.</p>
<p>Creatures that make a lot of noise in the vicinity of the natural bridge disturb a swarm of bats roosting on the bridges underside.</p>
<p>The bridge is narrow and uneven. Any creature that takes damage while standing on the bridge must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If the save fails by 5 or more, the creature falls into the chasm. On any other failed result, the creature slips and falls prone on edge of the bridge.</p>

<p>You come to a tunnel that runs north and south. Both ends of the tunnel have collapsed, but the west wall has a set of double doors with crude messages painted on them in Common. The message on the south door reads, &ldquo;NORBS RUM. KEEP OWT BROOG.&rdquo; The north door says, &ldquo;BROOGS RUM. NORB IZ STOOPID.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use the following text to describe the rooms interior:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crumbling masonry, huge uncured pelts, and heaps of picked-over bones and refuse fill this large room. It looks like it used to be a kitchen or bakery: huge ancient brick ovens stand in the middle of the chamber, although most are crumbling heaps of red rubble now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room was the main kitchen for the dwarven soldiers stationed in this part of Tyar-Besil. It is now the lair of Broog and Norb-the two heads of a particularly large and grumpy ettin. Broog-Norb has 130 hit points.</p>
<p>Broog-Norb isn&rsquo;t a follower of the Cult of the Black Earth. He found a way down into the ruins of Tyar-Besil months ago. The ettin has a tenuous truce with the earth cultists, who are careful to stay out of his way. He attacks intruders who make it clear that they aren&rsquo;t part of the earth cult, but only threatens intruders who present themselves as cult members. Broog-Norb has no idea who is a cultist and who isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Water fills a rectangular marble basin in the middle of this hall, and the walls display an ancient frieze that circles the room. The frieze depicts woodland images of deer, bears, and game fowl, along with parties of dwarven hunters. The southeast corner of the room is badly damaged, and the walls there are little more than rubble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dwarves of Tyar-Besil were proud of their pastoral ways, and they celebrated their surface dominions with scenes of farms and woodlands. This room served as a mess hall long ago, and many fine feasts were held here. The Black Earth cultists intend to repair the hall and replace the imagery with their own cheerless symbols, but they havent gotten around to it yet.</p>
<p>Piping buried under the floor connects to the spring in the northern part of the Crushing Wave cults territory and feeds the pool. The basin walls stand about a foot above the floor, and the pool is 4 feet deep. The water is fresh and safe to drink.</p>

<li>Droth, a male human mercenary thug in the service of the Howling Hatred cult. He is virtually catatonic but shuffles from place to place if led.</li>
<li>Wulgreda, a hapless female dwarf commoner who was captured while prospecting in the hills near the Sacred Stone Monastery. She warns the party that Orna is a Black Earth guard.</li>
<li>Gervor, a male half-elf noble who is all that is left of an adventuring company ambushed by the cult a month ago in the Sumber Hills. He is badly injured and has 1 hit point remaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wulgreda and Gervor are happy just to be released, although they ask the party to help them get to safety. Orna wants to go her own way, but she is willing to trade information for her freedom. She&rsquo;s willing to guide the characters to Marlos Urnrayle (<strong>area B21</strong>).</p>

That is the extent of her promise. If the characters ask why she is standing aside, she answers, &ldquo;Urnrayle has not paid me to fight puny mortals. He can look after his own slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t defend her duergar assistants, although she fights back with indignant fury if any mortal dares to attack her.

<p>This room serves as a guard post for the Black Earth cult. It also provides a good place from which the earth cultists can keep an eye on the Cult of the Eternal Flame. To guard this point of access, Marlos Urnrayle has assigned a garrison of five ogre with orders to let no one enter from the west without giving the pass sign of the earth cult (a triangle formed by thumbs and forefingers).

</blockquote>
<p>A Black Earth priest (see chapter 7) named Erione is establishing a shrine here atop the wreckage of an ancient dwarven chapel. She is joined by four cultist.</p>
<p>Erione resents the fact that few priests hold high places in the cult, and she intends to demonstrate that worship can bring even greater power. She has coaxed a black pudding into the porous rock obelisk. It seeps forth on her command.</p>
<p>Erione has manacled a female <strong>deep gnome</strong> named Rukhelmoth &ldquo;Rukh&rdquo; Glitterstone to the stone post at the foot of the obelisk and intends to offer him as a sacrifice to the black pudding. When the pudding emerges, it seeps out of the obelisk like thick black blood and attacks the gnome first. Only after the gnome has been consumed does it pay attention to the characters.</p>
<p>Rukh is an explorer who was captured as she tried to sneak into the Fane of the Eye. She hasnt explored the Temple of Black Earth but has seen areas B17 and B21. If rescued, she gladly shares the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The leader of the earth cult is a medusa named Marlos Urnrayle. He lairs in a cavern to the northeast.</li>
<li>A staircase to the south leads down to an ancient drow temple that has been overrun by elemental cultists.</li>

Lava from the volcanic rock below provided heat and material, and where the lava had flowed and then sank away again, rich veins of ore and gems were left behind in the natural tubes for the dwarves to discover and mine. For many centuries, the dwarves beneath the Sumber Hills forged weapons, hardware, and magnificent treasures. The best of these they kept for themselves. The rest traveled to the surface world, where merchants carried the dwarves work far afield. In time, as the city was abandoned, the forges grew quiet, the foundries cooled, and the dwarven masters left their workbenches to darkness and departed to other realms.</p>
<p>When Vanifer was first drawn to the complex, she instructed her minions to stake claims in and around the abandoned foundries. The tiefling knows that controlling the ability to craft the tools of warfare gives her cult a leg up on the others, and she fervently believes that she can use this power to bring the other elemental temples to heel, allowing her to rule over all.</p>

<p>The passage widens at this point, with two large alcoves flanking the hallway. Loose piles of stone form barricades at the front of each alcove, angled to defend against intrusion from the west. A path between the barricades leads to a wide, descending staircase to the east.</p>

<p>Four hobgoblin and one hobgoblin captain stand guard here, dressed in flame-red tabards with the symbol of elemental fire on the chest. They challenge anyone approaching from the west, but they pay little attention to anyone heading in that direction.</p>
<p>Visitors heading east must make the handsign of the fire cult (hands cupped together upright, with one pinky finger upward in the middle) or state the pass phrase, which is &ldquo;Fire is Eternal!&rdquo; Otherwise, visitors must convince the hobgoblins that they must talk to temple leaders.

<blockquote>
<p>The hall widens to form a domed chamber supported by four obsidian columns with fiery cracks in them. The air is oppressively warm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two razerblast (see chapter 7) keep to the sides of the chamber. How these guards react depends on how the characters arrive. If characters come from within the fire temple and act like they belong there, the guards pay them little mind. Characters who arrive escorted by hobgoblins must convince the guards to let them pass. If they do, one of the razerblasts escorts the party.</p>
<p>If a fight breaks out, one of the razerblasts shouts, &ldquo;Imix defend us!&rdquo; When this happens, read the following text aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The obsidian columns transform into pillars of magma that radiate intense heat and light, making the air shimmer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A creature that moves within 10 feet of one or more magma pillars for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes <wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll> fire damage. The razerblasts have immunity to fire damage.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No one in the fire cult knows of this secret area. The Dethek runes on one sarcophagus read, &ldquo;Rest well, Findon Stonemender. Dream of hammer and chisel echoing in your halls.&rdquo; On the other, they read, &ldquo;Beloved Gitte. Heavy are the hearts of all who knew ye.&rdquo;</p>

Word of the find eventually gets back to dwarven leaders throughout the North. Within a few weeks, a small delegation of dwarves tracks down the characters and asks for information on where the masks were found. The dwarves also insist that the masks be turned over to them. If the characters demand payment, the dwarves frown but agree to pay up to 200 pp for each mask.</p>
<p>Once the dwarves learn about an entrance to Tyar-Besil, they begin mounting expeditions. However, the Cult of the Eternal Flame will not relinquish its lair without a fight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Noise, light, and heat issue from this massive chamber. Runnels of lava flow from holes in the west wall into bronze troughs. Heat shimmers, smoke, and steam rise toward the domed ceiling, escaping through vents. Staircases rise at opposite ends of the room, and a smaller passage exits to the east. An efreeti drives azers and salamanders to make armaments here while fire cultists strand guard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chamber is the heart of the fire cults domain, the great foundry where they forge weapons and armor. Noise here drowns out any fighting taking place outside the immediate vicinity. An efreeti aided by one razerblast and two eternal flame guardian (see chapter 7 for both) drives a salamander and three azer, forcing them to work the forges.</p>
<p>As soon as any disturbance happens here, the slaves turn on the efreeti. The efreeti then focuses his attention on corralling his charges, leaving the cultists to deal with the characters. If it becomes obvious that the fight is going badly for the cultists, the efreeti retreats to his lair in the fire node (see chapter 5) via <strong>area E14</strong>.</p>
<p>If the characters arrive with salamanders or azers from <strong>area E11</strong>, those creatures take up arms on their respective sides. The salamanders and azers attack the efreeti until he retreats, then turn on each other. Survivors might be influenced to continue to help the characters as described in <strong>area E11</strong>.</p>
<p>None of the armor and weapons currently being forged here is near enough to completion to be used effectively.</p>
<p>An iron talking tube runs between the southwest wall of this room and the eastern wall of <strong>area E17</strong>, so that instructions could be passed back and forth between the smiths and the engineers operating the canal and lock mechanism in <strong>area E12</strong>.</p>

<p>The disk is made to rise or descend by uttering the proper command word into the shaft loudly enough for it to echo.

Lyzzies Quarters</h3><blockquote>
<p>Scorch marks and charred furnishings litter this chamber, and a burned tapestry spans the east wall. Dancing about the room are four small humanoids made of magma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dancing creatures are four magmin. They are curious to know who the characters are and playfully try to set them on fire. If they are harmed, the magmins hiss loud enough to alert their mistress, Lyzandra &ldquo;Lyzzie&rdquo; Calderos. She is a human mage with <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of fire</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>immolation</wc-fetch> prepared instead of <wc-fetch type=spell>ice storm</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>cone of cold</wc-fetch>. When the characters first arrive, Lyzzie is relaxing in a smaller room behind the burnt tapestry. Lyzzies room contains several scorched bunkbeds, a charred desk, but nothing of value.</p>

<p>This room has a vaulted ceiling thirty feet high. Wide alcoves dominate the east and west walls, and treasure glitters in the western one. An unpleasant musky scent mixes with the odor of sulfur here. The floor is marred with broken spots, scorch marks, bits of debris, and dark stains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A chimera loyal to the fire cult lounges in the western alcove. It emerges from its alcove to taunt and threaten the characters, pacing and snarling. If the characters attack it or try to plunder its hoard, it retaliates. Otherwise, it lets them pass through its lair unmolested.</p>

If any of these leaders survive after the characters leave the temple, the cultists reorganize their defenses and fight off further incursions. If Vanifer retreats to the deeper levels and the characters defeat Bastian and Lyzzie, the Eternal Flame cult loses its cohesion, and the surviving cultists abandon this level. Some retreat to the Fane of the Eye or the Weeping Colossus, while others flee the temple altogether. A few monsters might remain, such as the chimera, which rounds up as much loot as it can and takes to hunting stray cultists once their leaders are all gone.</p>
