<div class="gap-8 lg:grid items-start" style="grid-template-columns:auto 10rem">
<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>The struggle to defeat the forces of Elemental Evil is coming to a head. Characters have cleared out the cults surface outposts and taken the fight to the temples beneath the Sumber Hills. Below the ancient dwarven stronghold of Tyar-Besil is a deeper and even older maze of dark caverns-the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye. This area consists of the Fane of the Eye and the four elemental nodes from which the cults draw their power.</p>
<p>The elemental nodes are growing so strong that their mere existence is triggering catastrophes. Little investigation is to be done at this point; the cultists plans are clear. The big question is whether the characters can contain the damage. Time is pressing, and the party might have to make hard choices.</p>
<h3 id=character-advancement>
<a href=#character-advancement class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Character Advancement</h3><p>If the party cleaned out each of the temples in chapter 4, the adventurers begin this chapter around 10th level. The Fane of the Eye is intended for a 10th-level group; the Howling Caves are designed for an 11th-level party; the Plunging Torrents and Black Geode are intended for a party of about 12th level; and the Weeping Colossus is designed for a 13th-level party.</p>
<p>As a rough guideline, the party should gain one level after clearing the Fane, one level after finishing the first elemental node they explore, and one more level after completing the third node they explore.</p>
<h2 id=wrath-of-the-elements>

If they cant subdue the area with devastation orbs, the prophets tear open rifts to the elemental planes so that nothing can resist the elemental power.</p>
<p>The characters must contain the damage. Each time the characters retreat from the Fane of the Eye or finish exploring an elemental node, run one of the encounters from among &ldquo;Downpour,&rdquo; &ldquo;Burning Hills,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tortured Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, two new threats establish themselves in the area. Haayon the Punisher threatens Beliard, while Westbridge gives in to the Counsel of Despair. The adventurers might receive word of these situations, or the party might stumble across them.</p>
<h3 id=downpour>
<a href=#downpour class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Downpour</h3><p>If the water node is still active, a torrential downpour begins while the adventurers are traveling in the Sumber Hills. This torrent lasts for 12 hours, producing an immense amount of rain, wind, and lightning. The downpour has the following principal effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The adventurers cant finish a long rest unless they are indoors.</li>
<li>All overland travel takes twice as long.</li>
<li>Vision is heavily obscured past 100 feet.</li>
<li>The DC to avoid becoming lost increases to 15.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can present the characters with unexpected obstacles related to the storm to convey the idea that conditions are worsening in the Dessarin Valley.</p>
<h3 id=burning-hills>
<a href=#burning-hills class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Burning Hills</h3><p>Use this event only if the fire node is still active. The characters find themselves-and perhaps a settlement they care about-in the path of three fire elemental and five smoke mephit. The elementals go for the nearest large combustible objects, while the smoke mephits scatter and use their cinder breath to start small peripheral fires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The smell of smoke drifts on the air. Upwind, plumes of smoke billow up from the hillsides. Grass is catching fire at a furious rate, and the fire is moving quickly your way. Big creatures made of flame race over the ground, while small shapes flit in the smoke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adventurers detect the fire when it is 500 feet away. It covers a front of about 200 feet. At the start of each round, the fire advances <wc-roll>2d6 Ã— 10</wc-roll> feet. Smoke renders the fires area, and 100 feet ahead of it, lightly obscured.</p>
<p>A creature that enters the fire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> fire damage. If the creature isn&rsquo;t immune to fire and needs to breathe, it must also succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated from smoke inhalation until the start of its next turn.</p>
<h3 id=tortured-earth>

The effect is like that created by an <wc-fetch type=spell>earthquake</wc-fetch> spell, but the areas radius is 1,000 feet. The saving throw DC is 15.</p>
<p>As the tremor ends, a <strong>young purple worm</strong> with 184 hit points (challenge rating 13) burrows out of the ground. Driven into a frenzy by the quake, it attacks other living creatures nearby. It retreats rather than perishing in combat.</p>

They hope to be spared further sorrow and destruction. Characters learn of this development from Sedina Wolfpaw, a half-elf scout from Triboar who visited Westbridge, discovered the situation, and hurried to track down anyone who could help. She introduces the problem as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Westbridge was badly damaged by earthquakes. I was down that way, and I found half the town gathered in front of the Harvest Inn. Most of them were listening to a priest in stony armor. He was preaching about how destruction was coming, and only the chosen would be spared, and they were listening to him!&rdquo; She shakes her head. &ldquo;When I tried to speak up, the priest told the townies to seize me, but I managed to escape. I knew I had to find someone who can fight these lunatics, so here I am.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sedina is happy to accompany the party to Westbridge. Otherwise, she continues on her way.</p>

Jendon tries to persuade the adventurers to leave, explaining that, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any choice. The earth priests are the only ones who can save us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jendon isn&rsquo;t evil. He just doesn&rsquo;t see any evidence that so-called &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; have managed to stop the catastrophes ravaging the area. Jendon knows some might call him a coward, but he is convinced that submission to the forces of elemental earth is what any rational person would do.</p>
<h5 id=clandestine-arrival>

She wants nothing to do with the Black Earth cult and despairs that her neighbors knuckled under to the cultists. Reetha tells the characters that most townspeople are just scared, and that cultists have taken over the Harvest Inn.</p>
<h4 id=new-converts>

<blockquote>
<p>Much of Westbridge lies in ruins. A handful of people are out and about, but they keep to themselves. Several dozen more townsfolk have gathered in a clearing. They each wear a brown patch on their cloaks or tunics as they stand listening to a trio of hooded priests who are leading them in strange prayer to &ldquo;the Black Earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three hooded priests are junior members of the Black Earth cult (cultist) who are enjoying haranguing the forty or so commoners undergoing indoctrination. The cultists taunt any characters who approach, saying, &ldquo;These people have learned the truth. You can&rsquo;t save them, but we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Westbridgers are frightened. They don&rsquo;t like the cultists, but they think they need the cults protection against future disasters. Some beg the characters not to interfere, while others take the adventurers arrival as reason to stand up to the cult. If fighting breaks out here, most of the commoners scatter, but six aid the adventurers. These braver folk warn the characters that the &ldquo;high priest,&rdquo; Dreyon, is at the Harvest Inn and has a hill giant in his service.</p>
<h4 id=the-harvest-inn>

Two black earth guard, a hill giant named Lomm, and a gang of six hobgoblin aid him. (See chapter 7 for the cultists statistics.) The group has taken over the Harvest Inn. Lomm sleeps in the stable he has emptied of livestock.</p>
<p>Herivin Dardragon, the halfling proprietor, remains on the premises, along with four of his staff (human commoners). They are little better than poorly treated servants desperately trying to keep up with the hill giants appetite. Herivin and his staff want the villains dead.</p>
<p>When confronted, Dreyon orders the commoners to drive out the characters. If that fails, he then tries to use the Westbridgers as living shields.</p>

Bands of raiders roaming the area, minor outposts and lairs far from the Haunted Keeps, and survivors of the partys attacks are scattered and leaderless without direction. New leaders arise to gather the dispersed cultists and reestablish the defeated temples; one such leader is Haayon the Punisher.</p>
<p>Haayon is a cloud giant who hopes to become the next leader of the air cult. Late to answer the call of Elemental Evil, he recently arrived in the Dessarin Valley to discover the cult broken. The cloud giant believes the air cultists were defeated because they were weak, so he imposes a brutal regime of self-denial and atonement on surviving cultists.</p>
<p>Given time, Haayon might very well rebuild the Cult of the Howling Hatred. He knows little of whats happening underground, though he&rsquo;s extensively questioning each cultist he encounters. In his arrogance, he sees the existence of fleeing cultists as proof that new leadership is needed.</p>

For the description, choose a settlement the characters aren&rsquo;t in and that has not been destroyed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Refugees have been shuffling down from the hills north of the town. Some wear the white robes and black-feathered cowls of air cultists, while others are dressed in the green of the water cultists. Each person bears a placard around his or her neck, reading &ldquo;I am punished.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The refugees are cultist who fled the defeats at the Haunted Keeps and the elemental temples, but then got rounded up by Haayon. Those who Haayon finds worthy are welcomed into his camp. The unworthy are marked with placards and sent away. Only the rejected cultists know where Haayons camp is.</p>

When the adventurers locate the camp, read the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A footpath leads to a ruined stone wall that rings a hilltop. A dozen tents are pitched in the shelter of the walls, along with a pavilion. At one side of the camp, five slumped figures are tied to wooden posts, each captive with a placard around his or her neck. Silent figures in leather breeches stand guard.</p>

<p>Five crushing wave reaver and a Howling Hatred priest wearing a balloon pack watch the outer camp. (See chapter 7 for the cultists statistics and rules for the balloon pack.) The figures tied to the posts are five air and water cultists. Each has 1 hit point remaining and wears a wooden placard that reads, &ldquo;I am punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haayon the cloud giant, two feathergale knight (see chapter 7), and six loyal cultist gather inside the pavilion. Behind the pavilion are two hippogriff that serve the knights as mounts. The giant and his minions hear any fighting that breaks out in the outer part of the camp but don&rsquo;t join the fray until their turns during the fourth round.</p>

If they ask about the punished cultists, the giant justifies their humiliation by saying they&rsquo;re weak. If they serve as a warning to others, all the better.</p>
<p>Haayon is a patient and perceptive listener. He is committed to forcing any newcomers to join his group. Such initiates must subject themselves to his judgment. If the adventurers refuse, Haayon says, &ldquo;Consent isn&rsquo;t necessary for judgment. Lack of it proves punishment is required.&rdquo; He then gives the signal to attack.</p>

Long ago, drow exiles devoted to the worship of Elemental Evil built this subterranean shrine to the Elder Elemental Eye. This is where the four prophets found their elemental weapons.</p>
<p>The Fane of the Eye serves as common ground for the cults. Here the animosities among air, earth, fire, and water are set aside, and a wary truce prevails. Malevolent and inscrutable, the Eye watches over the cultists and judges them, or so the prophets believe. Were it not for the belief that the Eye wants them to work together, the cults would fight constantly.</p>
<p>Each temple complex in the ruins of Tyar-Besil offers access to the fane. Below the fane are four elemental nodes from which the cults draw their power. Cultists traveling to an elemental node must pass through the fane. Each cult keeps control over access to its elemental node, but any of the temples or elemental nodes can be accessed from the fane.</p>

The chamber ceilings are about 10 feet above the floor near the walls, but they can be as much as 30 feet high in the middle.</p>
<p>Dark Curtains. Clouds of black fog, cold and oily to the touch, cordon off areas of the fane. They block vision and mute sound. Objects pass through unimpeded, but living creatures doing so feel psychic resistance and nausea from pushing through. Only creatures devoted to Elemental Evil are untroubled by the sensations.</p>

<p>After 80 feet, the pit tapers into a tunnel (<strong>area N1</strong> of the Howling Caves, described later in this chapter). Chaotic gusts blow up and down the shaft, too weak to pose an actual hazard. Climbing the rough pit walls requires successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks.</p>

<p>A stone pedestal in the middle of this cavern holds a glassy sphere about eight inches in diameter. The sphere seems to contain swirling smoke. Battered armor, damaged weapons, and tattered clothing are strewn around the chamber, but the floor within ten feet of the sphere is free of such debris. Several weapons on the ground seem like they might still be serviceable, although all are badly worn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the orb is disturbed, all creatures within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be swept up into a whirlwind, suspended 20 feet in the air. The orb vanishes as the whirlwind forms.</p>
<p>Those suspended in the whirlwind are restrained and battered by windblown debris. At the start of each of its turns, a creature restrained by the whirlwind takes <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> bludgeoning damage. A creature in the whirlwind can use its action to attempt a DC 20 Strength check. If successful, the creature ends the restrained condition on it, falls 20 feet to the floor, and escapes the whirlwind. A creature outside the whirlwind can attempt a similar check to pull another creature from the whirlwind, assuming it has the ability to reach a target 20 feet in the air. The whirlwind lasts 1 minute and then collapses, releasing creatures caught within it.</p>
<p>While the whirlwind rages, four flying sword animate from the debris scattered around the cave. The flying swords attack creatures outside the whirlwind.</p>

<p>A bronze torch glowing with a magical light lies next to the corpse of a bare-chested man with a shield in the shape of a crab shell and a broken shark-toothed sword. Several other corpses are scattered on the floor. Some have been picked down to bone, their clothing and armor discarded nearby, while others have hardly been touched.</p>
<p>The walls are uneven, with small ledges and fissures on all sides. The ceiling is about a hundred feet high.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three harpy nest on the highest ledges. These wicked creatures guard the cave for the Cult of the Howling Hatred. The bodies are those whom the harpies lured to destruction. When the harpies spot intruders, they begin to sing.</p>
<p>Those who are affected by the harpies song are compelled to climb. The nests are 80 feet above the floor. The first 40 feet of the climb require a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks, but after that, the DC is 15.</p>
<p>Corpses. The bodies on the floor include a water cultist (the figure with the crab-shell shield and broken sword), two lizardfolk, an ogre, and a male halfling in the robes of a cleric of Sune, and a female half-elf fighter in battered plate armor.</p>

<p>This cavern is the center of the Crushing Wave cult&rsquo;s presence in the fane. Two water weird lurk in the pool and guard the area for the cult. They attack anyone approaching the water who fails to give the water cult&rsquo;s hand sign. The pool is 20 feet deep. Swimming in the pool requires DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks due to the swirling currents. Any creature that fails such a check is swept into the stream.</p>
<p>The stream is 4 feet deep, cold, and swift. Any creature without a swimming speed that moves into the stream for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be swept 40 feet downstream.

<p>A creature swept over the falls lands in a water-filled basin (<strong>area P1</strong> of the Plunging Torrents, described later in this chapter), taking no damage.

<p>A forest of weird fungal growth infests this large cavern. Giant toadstools and puffballs stand in and among shallow pools of water or atop ledges along the walls. Those walls are covered by huge growths of shelf fungi. Water drips constantly from above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The influences of elemental earth and elemental water meet in this cavern, producing a muddy bog crowded with enormous fungi. Most of the fungi are harmless, and some are even edible. However, three <strong>violet fungi</strong> cluster where the footpaths intersect.</p>
<p>A grell lurks in the upper reaches of the chamber, watching for lone travelers or stragglers it might be able to pick off. The creature quietly drifts down and attacks the rearmost member of a party that is otherwise occupied.</p>

<p>A stone sarcophagus rests on a dais in the southern half of this room. A worn frieze circles the monument about four feet above the ground, but it has been badly damaged, and it is difficult to make out what the carvings represent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This crypt marks the resting place of a dwarven hero of ancient Tyar-Besil who fought a great battle against monsters invading from the Underdark. Close inspection shows that the wall carvings depict a dwarf slaughtering minotaurs and grimlocks. The name Hendrel Foebreaker is inscribed in the Dethek script on the lid of the sarcophagus, followed by the Dwarvish phrase, &ldquo;Bow your head, and remember valor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crypt contains Hendrels bones, interred here as a warning to Besilmers enemies. His tomb is also the center of a hallow spell, which extends to the doors of the room.

Zegdars Lair</h3><blockquote>
<p>This cavern is festooned with dozens of burned human hands and reptilian claws fixed to the walls with iron nails. An iron brazier in the middle of the room is full of hot, glowing coals. A large sleeping pallet of furs is arranged to the south. A hulking minotaur sits on the pallet, counting coins in an iron coffer, while a strange one-eyed creature cowers next to the brazier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minotaur is Zegdar, chief of the Emberhorn tribe. He has 117 hit points, wears a chain mail hauberk (AC 16), has an Intelligence score of 11, speaks Undercommon, and is blessed by Imix. The blessing grants the minotaur immunity to fire damage as well as the following additional action option:</p>
<p>Burning Breath (Recharge 5-6). The minotaur exhales a cloud of burning embers in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (<wc-roll>6d6</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>Vanifer has directed Wyx, a simpering nothic, to act as Zegdars adviser. Wyx flatters Zegdar so that he does his job and doesn&rsquo;t become a problem. The rest of the Emberhorns hate Wyx, but Zegdar sees the nothic as proof of his importance.</p>

<p>A ten-foot-wide slab of stone levitates in the center of this wide vertical shaft. A bridge-like pier of rock juts out to meet the platform from a wide ledge on the eastern side of the shaft. Hot fumes rise from below, and the shaft glows with fiery light below this level. The shaft continues upward into darkness.</p>
<p>Three passages lead away from the shaft. A small brass gong and a striking hammer are near the ledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The floating disk is made to move by uttering the proper command word loudly enough for it to echo. The command words are &ldquo;ash&rdquo; to make the platform sink and &ldquo;ember&rdquo; to make it rise. It takes 1 minute for it to move from one place to another. The shaft ascends to <strong>area E14</strong> in the Temple of Eternal Flame and descends to <strong>area W1</strong> in the Weeping Colossus (the fire node, described later in this chapter).</p>

<p>The stonework in this chamber is noticeably different from the natural caverns nearby. The room was roughly hewn from the surrounding rock but never dressed or finished. In the middle of the floor is a strange symbol shaped like overlapping circles, cut into the stone with two-inch wide channels.</p>

<p>Two minotaur of the Emberhorn tribe stand guard in this chamber, defending the fire cults foothold in the fane. They have the Burning Breath special action (see <strong>area F14</strong>), having received the &ldquo;blessing of Imix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long before dwarves established their stronghold in the caves above the fane, these caverns belonged to drow who were drawn here by the areas elemental energies. This chamber was a conjuring room where drow summoned demons using the circles etched in the floor. Any character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the nature of the circles, and that they are ancient and damaged to the point of uselessness.</p>

<p>This chamber has been a battleground for the elemental cults as they seek to consolidate control of the fane. The Cult of the Howling Hatred presently holds the room, which is guarded by an air elemental myrmidon (see chapter 7).</p>
<p>When intruders appear, the myrmidon levels its flail at them and asks in a cold voice, &ldquo;Whom do you serve?&rdquo; The myrmidon decides whether the adventurers are friends or foes, based on their response to its question and the gear they wear. If the characters look like air cultists and reply that they serve elemental air or the Elder Elemental Eye, the myrmidon might be satisfied. If not, the myrmidon attacks.</p>

Accompanying the prophet is a handful of subordinates. Choose from the following options, discounting any prophet who has been defeated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aerisi Kalinoth. The air prophet is accompanied by Windharrow (if he escaped the Temple of Howling Hatred), two hurricanes, and three Howling Hatred initiates.</li>
<li>Gar Shatterkeel. He is mounted on a giant crocodile and accompanied by four Crushing Wave reavers.</li>
<li>Marlos Urnrayle. The earth prophet is accompanied by two gargoyles and two sacred stone monk wearing gargoyle masks.</li>
<li>Vanifer. The fire prophet has a flameskull and two razerblasts under her command.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prophet knows who the characters are. He or she is also aware of any other prophets the party has faced and defeated, having seen the events in fevered visions. The prophet dismisses any such defeat as the culling the weak, assuring the characters that no such weakness is to be found here.</p>
<p>If it seems in keeping with the prophets personality (see chapter 7), he or she attempts to recruit the characters, saying, &ldquo;You have shown you are resourceful and have great courage. We can use you. Swear allegiance to me, and I shall show you power such as you have never dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>

The prophet and entourage move to a tactically safe position. Then, to prove their sincerity, the new converts must offer the sacrifice. The villains have a commoner named Darreth, abducted from Womford weeks ago, as a sacrifice. Darreth is already bound, gagged, and lying at the foot of the altar.</p>
<p>Darreth doesn&rsquo;t know the layout of the fane, but he has met each prophet except the one the characters defeated on the temple level. He can describe their appearance and demeanor, and he can identify the elemental weapons that each one carries. Further, he knows that these weapons are important and somehow connected to places of elemental power called &ldquo;nodes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he is set free, Darreth is brave enough to accompany the characters if they so wish, and also desperate enough to make the trip back to Womford alone if the characters give him directions back to the surface.</p>

When the air cult seized the caves below Tyar-Besil, the svirfneblin organized resistance. Their attempt was futile. As soon as Aerisi Kalinoth understood the power of the devastation orbs, she tested one on the svirfneblin. The resulting cyclone obliterated the outpost, and its chaotic aftereffects imbued the caves with elemental power which blows through the caves to this day.</p>

Deadly Pool</h3><blockquote>
<p>The temperature plunges in this cave, which is dominated by a frozen pool. Ice crystals glitter on the walls, floor, and other rock formations. Snow whirls about on strong gusts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters first arrive, the temperature in this cave is -30 degrees Fahrenheit. The ice is frozen solid and slippery. (See chapter 5, &ldquo;Adventure Environments,&rdquo; in the <em>Dungeon Masters Guide</em> for rules on extreme cold and slippery ice.) For every minute the characters spend here, there is a cumulative ten percent chance that the temperature shifts dramatically.</p>
<p>When the temperature shifts, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly, the air grows very warm. Water rains from above. The ice cracks, and thick waves of steam rise from the pool. Bobbing among the breaking ice, the bloated bodies of small humanoids stare up with wide, dead eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shift to extreme heat, as described in chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Masters Guide</em>, takes only a moment. When the heat begins, the ice cracks at the start of that round and is unable to hold any weight end of the round 3 rounds later. The lake is 12 feet deep and turns to boiling water. A creature that enters the water for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there takes 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) fire damage. In addition, steam renders the cave lightly obscured.</p>

<p>Gore spatters the floor and walls of this windy cave, and the floor is strewn with dismembered humanoid corpses. A windy cyclone moves among the remains. A shaft in the ceiling leads up farther than you can see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shaft leads to <strong>area A18</strong> in the Temple of Howling Hatred. An air elemental is bound to this area and cycles beneath the shaft like a red cyclone. Everywhere it moves, it spatters the walls with blood, bone, and viscera.</p>
<p>The corpses are sacrifices to Yan-C-Bin, hurled down the shaft by air cultists. The symbol of elemental air is cut into each victims forehead. The characters can find an intact head and see the symbol in gory relief.</p>

Svirfneblin Settlement</h3><p>If the nycaloth is in <strong>area N7</strong>, the characters hear a horrid, rasping song coming from the eastern passage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dwellings carved in the walls of this cavern have been torn asunder by some intense force. Ruins of several dwellings resemble gaps in the walls and piles of rubble. Scores of small humanoid corpses are scattered among the ruins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This svirfneblin settlement was the test site for Aerisi Kalinoths first <em>devastation orb</em>. Four specter of deep gnomes who perished here wander the ruins. The power of the air node imbued them with elemental energy, so their attacks deal lightning damage instead of necrotic. They attack any creature that enters the cavern.</p>

Breathless Cave</h3><blockquote>
<p>Giant spiders are seized in death among dead cave lizards, giant bats, a carrion crawler, and a female drow decked in fine chain mail, with ruby-pommeled knives at her hips. No injuries are apparent, and the smell of death is fainter than one would expect. At the back of the cave, within ten feet of the drow, a breeze whistles through three tiny fissures in the rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fissures magically pull the air from the cave and the lungs of any creature that comes within 30 feet of the back of the cave. Such a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to breathe. The creature cant breathe normally again unless it succeeds on the saving throw, made again at the end of each minute. A remove curse spell also ends the effect, as does bottled breath (see chapter 7).</p>

<p>This gruesome display is the work of a nycaloth that takes sadistic delight in torturing captives. It guards the outer reaches of the Howling Caves against intruders.</p>

<p>The humans are two howling hatred initiate (see chapter 7) who angered Aerisi one time too many. They&rsquo;re sullen and silent if interrogated. They flee for the surface at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>Feathergale knights captured the aarakocra, named Kazra and brought her here for interrogation. She wants only to fly under the open sky once again and pleads with the characters to escort her back to the surface.</p>
<p>The drow mage, Balix, is a historian and companion to the dead scout in <strong>area N5</strong>. They came to see the Fane of the Eye and to find out if surfacers were here, and they walked into a cult ambush. He wants nothing to do with the cults, the surface world, or anything other than returning to the nearest drow community. He uses his innate darkness spell to retreat as soon as possible.</p>

Some are as low and wide as forest ferns while others stand as tall as humans, their stems thick as the trunks of trees. Still others shed a faint light, eerily illuminating a sloped passage leading down to the shore of a placid body of water that also glows dimly. Beneath whispering gusts of air, the sound of dripping water echoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the myriad fungi, several are magical and act as potions if eaten. One aqua-spotted toadstool acts as a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of longevity</wc-fetch>. Two amber toadstools flecked with gray work as <wc-fetch type=item>potion of heroism</wc-fetch>. Three pale lavender toadstools are like <wc-fetch type=item>potion of healing</wc-fetch>. These magical toadstools regrow over the course of the next year.</p>
<p>Eating any other toadstool forces the eater to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw after <wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll> minutes. Failure indicates the consumer is poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, ending the effect on a success.</p>

<p>At an intersection of four tunnels, a mighty gale blows from the northern way, making a constant howl. Two braziers burn with green flame, lighting the area. Numerous rock columns join the floor to the ceiling. Severed silk ropes, darkly sodden with blood, sit at the base of three gore-spattered columns. Tied to two other columns are two women, each with a symbol cut into her forehead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prisoners are kept here until they can be sacrificed to Yan-C-Bin in <strong>area N19</strong>. Two invisible barlgura guard the prisoners. The demons lurk among the columns in the upper reaches of the cave, dropping down to attack intruders who dare free the prisoners. If they spot the characters, the two women warn characters of the &ldquo;invisible demons&rdquo; that guard them.</p>

<p>A powerful wind roars through this small cave, causing bits of debris to ricochet off the walls, exploding into dust from the impact.

The wind doesn&rsquo;t seem to impede them at all.</p>

A creature swept over a waterfall takes no damage from the fall. However, at the start of its turn in the lower basin, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be driven 10 feet underwater and restrained there. The creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, ending the restrained condition on a success.</p>

On a roll of 1, choose one character to receive an image of the setting features (but not creatures) in <strong>area P4</strong>, P5, or P6. The aboleth living in the node is telepathically projecting these images to frighten trespassers and ultimately lure them to its lair.</p>
<p>Whenever a character responds to this telepathic contact, a link is established. The aboleth instantly knows all the characters desires and goals. It then intermittently projects images to the character in which everything the character loves is destroyed by the Cult of the Crushing Wave. After receiving these images, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or suffer a random form of short-term madness, as described in chapter 8, &ldquo;Running the Game,&rdquo; of the <em>Dungeon Masters Guide</em>.</p>

Waterfall Basin</h3><p>The waterfall here can be heard from quite a distance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A loud waterfall pours into this mossy cavern. Wet stairs hug the western wall, climbing higher than the waterfall and descending into the water-filled basin. Where the stairs meet the waters surface, an iron post juts at an angle, and a flat boat is tied to it. Tunnels to the northeast and northwest channel the water from the pool. Above the pool, a seven-foot-diameter globe of water hovers in midair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher notices the water symbol engraved above the northeast passageway.</p>
<p>The stairs descend 5 feet beneath the lake surface, ending at a rough underwater ledge 15 feet above the submerged cavern floor. The stairs ascend to <strong>area F8</strong> in the Fane of the Eye.</p>
<h4 id=iron-post>

When the characters arrive in the chamber for the first time, a punt is moored here.</p>
<p>The punt is a long, flat-bottomed boat equipped with a pole for navigation through the water node. This punt can accommodate up to seven Medium creatures. As part of its movement, a creature can use the pole to propel the punt 10 feet. The punt has AC 8 and 50 hit points. If it goes over a waterfall, it loses 25 hit points and capsizes.</p>

The globe has a flying speed of 10 feet, and a creature contained within gains the benefit of a water breathing spell for as long as it remains in the globe. Any time during the trip, the creature inside the globe can swim out of it as an action. The globe carries only the one creature and bursts upon reaching its destination. A globe is immune to damage, though dust of dryness destroys it.</p>
<p>When the globe is destroyed or leaves this cave, another one rises up out of the water to take its place.</p>

<p>The current moves swiftly toward a small, rocky island that splits the waterway north and south. The sound of falling water is louder to the south.</p>

<p>The current pulls to the south of the island toward the waterfall leading to <strong>area P17</strong>. Characters navigating the area by water are pulled south and over the falls unless they take countermeasures.</p>

<p>The waterway dead-ends in a long cavern where only the distant sound of the falls echoes off the walls. Nets divide the cavern, spanning the distance between pairs of stalagmites jutting above the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seven giant crab dwell in this cavern. Three are in plain sight on the rocky ledge to the northwest. Two crabs cling underwater to each span of net. Characters observing the water must roll a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the submerged crabs, which climb their nets to attack any creatures that pass within reach. Once combat starts, all the crabs attack.</p>

<p>The water fills the cavern to within 2 feet of the ceiling. The following boxed text assumes that the characters can see underwater:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the water looms a colonnade supporting an arched pediment above a long portico. Behind the colonnade is a pair of stone doors graven with a relief of a circular, saw-toothed maw. In the plaza in front of this structure, four slimy, fishlike humanoids kneel beneath a sunken stone idol of branching tentacles, which convene at the top around a circular fanged mouth.</p>
<p>At the southwestern end of the plaza, a set of curving stairs climbs above the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four kuo-toa worship at the altar, while a kuo-toa whip guards the northeast doors. The kuo-toa try to capture victims for their aboleth god (see <strong>area P6</strong>).</p>

<p>Stairs lined with columns ascend from the water to a landing where a block of smooth stone serves as an altar. Chains snake from the base of the altar, ending in open, rusty manacles.</p>
<p>Three fish-like humanoids with jagged teeth stand around the altar. One wears a headdress of kelp and seashells, and it holds aloft a trident with tines shaped like tentacles.</p>

<p>This is where the aboleth in <strong>area P6</strong> comes to feed on sacrifices. A kuo-toa archpriest armed with a <wc-fetch type=item>trident of fish command</wc-fetch> and two kuo-toa attend their god here. They attempt to capture the characters and chain them to the altar.

Yngukulub the Devourer</h3><p>An aboleth named Yngukulub the Devourer has allied itself with Gar Shatterkeel and the Cult of the Crushing Wave. Deranged kuo-toa bring the aboleth sacrifices, and when they lack a proper sacrifice, they willingly feed themselves to their hungry god.</p>
<p>Yngukulub obeys Gar Shatterkeel because it awaits the day when Olhydra drowns the civilized world and crushes the temples of the gods. In the dark age that results from the triumph of Olhydra, aboleths can return to their proper place as rulers of the world.</p>
<p>If Gar Shatterkeel was defeated in the Temple of the Crushing Wave, the aboleth guards the water portal in <strong>area P20</strong>. Otherwise, it is here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The slimy water that fills this cave flows through a hole in the east wall before plunging into the cavernous darkness beyond. Tall, slime-covered columns ascend from the foul water. Each one is decorated with a mosaic depicting elves, dwarves, humans, and other races descending into the fanged maw of a three-eyed, tentacled horror at the base of the column. The monsters eyes glitter like gems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is here, the aboleth reaches out telepathically to the characters, promising to fulfill their desires in exchange for servitude. Characters who refuse are pulled down into the briny depths and devoured. The aboleth is heavily obscured by the dark, slimy water while completely submerged.

<p>Gar Shatterkeel uses this chamber as his personal retreat, where he reflects on the future of his cult.</p>
<p>The water here radiates divination magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell. Once per day, when a creature touches the narwhal horn to the pool, a scrying spell is instantaneously cast. The spell is limited to creatures and locations within the Plunging Torrents, allows no saving throw, and turns the pools surface into a scrying sensor. If the horns wielder doesn&rsquo;t specify a target before touching the horn to the pool, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll>. The roll is the number of the area shown in the pool for the spells duration. (For example, a roll of 9 focuses the scrying sensor on <strong>area P9</strong>.)</p>
<p>A submerged passage leads to <strong>area P14</strong>. Characters swimming underwater spot it automatically.</p>

Marlos Urnrayle used Ironfang to transform these caverns into an earth node. In the Black Geodes largest cavern lies a portal that leads to OgrÃ©mochs domain on the Elemental Plane of Earth. Bizarre creatures from that place have crossed through the gate and now inhabit the caverns, while the raw energy of the elemental plane seeps out and is slowly transforming the Black Geode into a reflection of OgrÃ©mochs domain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rough walls of this cavern rise to a vaulted ceiling hung with stalactites and clumps of slender, luminous crystals that bathe the cavern in a soft, violet light. Passages lead east and west. To the east, the tunnel ascends. The western passage is flanked by a pair of twenty-foot tall stone statues of rough-hewn humanoids, their faces grim masks of forbiddance. Next to each statue is a human guard encased in stone armor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two black earth guard (see chapter 7) stand in front of the statues. Characters not wearing disguises are recognized for who they really are. Characters disguised as earth cultists or cult prisoners must make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the guards Wisdom (Insight) checks; if all the characters succeed, the guards are fooled and allow them to pass.</p>
<p>If combat erupts here, two earth elemental burst up from the middle of the floor and join the battle. These elementals have veins of glowing purple crystal; each sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for another 15 feet beyond that.</p>

Casually dropping gemstones into the creatures gaping mouth is a creepy-looking earth cultist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A stonemelder (see chapter 7) named Keltar keeps vigil with a xorn he discovered hiding in <strong>area G17</strong>. If the characters attack either, both retaliate in kind. The xorn flees once it has fewer than 20 hit points, but Keltar fights to the death.</p>

In fact, the creature wandered through the earth portal out of curiosity. Since Keltar was eager to please Gorx, it has done nothing to dissuade him.</p>
<p>The xorn has convinced Keltar that OgrÃ©moch wants tribute, and so Keltar extracts offerings from everyone who passes through. Keltar is so obsessed with offerings that he ignores the appearance of passersby and the usual pass phrase. When he notices the characters, he asks, &ldquo;Do you bring an offering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making an offering involves throwing precious metals or gems into the xorns maw. Keltar soberly informs contributors the treasure is transported to OgrÃ©mochs domain.</p>
<p>The xorn can smell the partys wealth, and so it demands a tribute of 500 gp in Terran. If the party complies, Keltar asks, &ldquo;Is our prince satisfied with the offering?&rdquo; to which Gorx replies, &ldquo;The prince finds this sacrifice pleasing.&rdquo; Keltar believes the xorn has deemed the party worthy, so he allows them to pass. He also helpfully responds to inquiries. If the characters are undisguised, he directs them toward <strong>area G3</strong>, as another test of their worthiness. Keltar directs the characters toward <strong>area G6</strong> if he believes them to be cultists and also reminds them of the pass phrase to cross the stone bridge (<strong>area G9</strong>) safely: &ldquo;We walk in the shadow of OgrÃ©moch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the characters refuse to pay, the xorn attacks the character carrying the most treasure. Meanwhile, Keltar flees to <strong>area G6</strong>.</p>

<p>Once the party can see the cave, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>

Only one skeleton remains whole, and it clutches to its chest an open-faced steel helmet decorated with a golden circlet above the brow, from which seven small gold spikes project upward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crowned helmet is an ancient dwarven relic (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below) that radiates strong magic when scrutinized with a detect magic spell. As soon as someone tries to take it, the ghost of a duergar treasure hunter named Reulek appears and uses his Horrifying Visage, screaming, &ldquo;Thieves! Learn from my folly! Even in death, the dwarves of Besilmer guard their fabled treasure!&rdquo; As the ghost intones these words, four specter of dead drow killed here long ago in a cave collapse materialize and attack the living.</p>

Reulek later stole it and was sneaking toward <strong>area G5</strong> when he fell prey to the specters in this cave.</p>
<p>Reulek believes the specters killed him for stealing the helmet. His soul is bound to the relic by the thought that he must return it to its rightful owner before going to his eternal rest.</p>
<p>If the adventurers defeat the specters and talk to the ghost, Ruelek explains his predicament. If the characters point out the specters werent dwarves and probably didnt care about the crown, Reulek admits that his death may have had nothing to do with the relic. He knows that the remains of the last king of Besilmer are beneath the Halls of the Hunting Axe. He asks the characters to help him return the crowned helm to the kings tomb. Characters who agree find that Reulek accompanies them through his connection to the relic, although he manifests only when you wish him to do so.</p>
<p>If the party refuses to help, or if at any point Reulek gets the sense that they aren&rsquo;t going to follow through on their promise, he uses Possession to enforce the agreement. If the party stays true to the bargain, Reuleks spirit thanks them as he goes to his rest.</p>
<p>Reulek was the partner of an oni named Obratu (see &ldquo;Vale of Dancing Waters&rdquo; in chapter 6). The characters might recognize his name from the note they find if they defeat Obratu. Reulek shrugs if the characters mention Obratu, saying, &ldquo;It was a partnership of convenience.&rdquo;</p>

The bridge is 40 feet above the floor of the surrounding cavern (<strong>area G10</strong>).</p>
<p>Two galeb duhr guard the bridge-one at each end. They look like ordinary boulders until they open their eyes and move. To cross the bridge without rousing the galeb duhrs, someone among the passersby must speak the cults pass phrase: &ldquo;We walk in the shadow of OgrÃ©moch!&rdquo; Otherwise, the galeb duhrs wait until intruders are halfway across the bridge before attacking, first by animating the boulders set near them and commanding them to roll across the bridge.</p>

<p>At any given time, the cave contains two black earth guard, one burrowshark, and one stonemelder (see chapter 7 for these cultists statistics).

<p>There is a fifty percent chance that a burrowshark (see chapter 7) named Rorgrin is here, along with his trained bulette mount; otherwise they&rsquo;re in <strong>area G14</strong>. If they are here, Rorgrin and his mount are in plain view and attack intruders on sight.</p>
<p>The enclosures to the north and south are kennels enclosed by 10-foot-high walls. The south kennels are empty. The northern kennels contain three <strong>young bulettes</strong> (use rhinoceros statistics, but they bite instead of gore). These bulettes are sleeping if Rorgrin isn&rsquo;t present. A character can sneak past the sleeping bulettes by succeeding on a DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check. The bulettes awaken on a failed check or if one or more of them is attacked. If Rorgrin is in <strong>area G14</strong>, the roused bulettes hiss at strangers, alerting Rorgrin to their presence.</p>

<p>Marlos taunts the characters, challenging those who avert their eyes to behold his power and beauty. The medusa is infuriated if anyone manages to meet his gaze and survive, concentrating his attacks on such characters.</p>

Part of the monolith is in a liquid state at any given time, and any creature that touches the liquid stone is pulled into the Plane of Earth, near OgrÃ©mochs dwelling place. The Prince of Evil Earth can attack intruders on his home plane but cant pursue them through the portal into the world until the proper ritual is complete.</p>
<p>Characters can close the portal only by striking the monolith with <wc-fetch type=item>Ironfang</wc-fetch>. When the elemental weapon strikes the monolith, it chips the otherwise indestructible stone, causing the portal to implode in a grinding display, showering the area with pulverized rock and crystal. OgrÃ©moch is forced back to his home plane when this event happens, serving the cult. Cultists other than Marlos cower and flee. After the portal is destroyed, Ironfang turns to rust and disintegrates.</p>
<p>When the portal implodes, an earthquake spell is triggered, centered at the point where the monolith once stood. Five minutes later, this entire cavern collapses, killing and burying any creatures still inside. The bridge at <strong>area G9</strong> collapses as well, while other areas of the Black Geode remain intact.

During the height of the dwarven civilization of Besilmer, lava filled this entire area, and the heat and magma rose into the lowest levels of the city where the foundries were located. When Vanifer arrived with her cult, she used her connection with Imix, the Prince of Evil Fire, to settle the magma and form the chambers left behind. Now, the fissure and lava tubes serve as the fire node, an extension of the Elemental Plane of Fire, resulting in lava flows, ash storms, gouts of liquid fire, and other strange elemental effects.</p>

A magical disk allows easy movement among the levels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The natural walls of the shaft widen near the base. Heat and light radiate from a bubbling lake of lava that covers most of the floor. Lava flows through an exit to the northeast. Stone passages open to the northwest, west, and south.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One flamewrath watches from the tunnel labeled &ldquo;a,&rdquo; while one Eternal Flame priest is positioned at the tunnel labeled &ldquo;b.&rdquo; A razerblast stands watch in the middle passage. (See chapter 7 for the cultists statistics.) The guards attack intruders who fail to use the pass phrase, &ldquo;Hail the heart of fire!&rdquo;</p>

It has an indentation in the shape of a human hand. When pressed, the plate causes basalt pillars to rise from the lava, creating stepping stones between the floating disk and the middle passage. The pillars are hot when they first rise. A creature that comes into contact with a hot pillar for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) fire damage.

</blockquote>
<p>One razerblast (see chapter 7) and one fire giant lounge here, off duty from keeping watch over <strong>area W1</strong>. When the characters first enter this chamber, the fire giant is dozing on the upper shelf. The razerblast sits near the jet of flame, treating it like a campfire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This rough, circular cave is painfully hot. A curved wall of fire stretches from floor to ceiling and leaves only five feet between it and the surrounding walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ceiling here is 20 feet high. The fire is a ring-shaped <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of fire</wc-fetch> spell made permanent (until dispelled) by Vanifer. A creature that ends its turn in this room but outside the ring takes <wc-roll>5d8</wc-roll> fire damage. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>
<p>Vanifer can control this wall, lowering it (or parts of it) to deposit or extract prisoners and then raising it again. The wall radiates no heat inside the ring, so the prisoners are unharmed while they remain there.</p>

The prisoners include two Waterdhavian caravan merchants named Kharloss and Jarlee (use the noble statistics), a Crushing Wave reaver named Dirana, and a moon elf druid named Teresiel. They have been stripped of their armor and weapons, which the cultists tossed into the lava.</p>
<p>Kharloss and Jarlee are willing to pay up to 500 gp for an escort to any town in the Dessarin Valley. They&rsquo;re honest. However, it takes several tendays to acquire the necessary coin from their holdings in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>Dirana is willing to trade information. She can sketch a basic map of the Temple of the Crushing Wave and the Plunging Torrents. She hasnt been to either place in several tendays and doesn&rsquo;t know who or what inhabits most of the chambers.</p>
<p>Teresiel is a member of the Emerald Enclave. She managed to conceal on her person a tiny leather packet that holds nine yellow seeds. Under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, each seed radiates an aura of conjuration magic. Plating a seed in fertile earth causes it grow into an awakened tree after <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> rounds. The awakened tree understands one language known to its creator and follows its creator&rsquo;s commands to the best of its ability. Teresiel doesn&rsquo;t relinquish with the seeds willingly and is determined to deliver them to the abbey at Golden elds. She asks the characters to help her complete the delivery.</p>

<p>Four salamander and eight fire snake swim in the lava, which they use as a breeding pool.

<p>A stream of lava flows down this long, sloping chamber to an immense magma pool beyond, tumbling over a series of rock shelves. One enormous point of rock juts up and forward from the flow.</p>

<p>A young red dragon, Halinaxus, sits upon the point of rock, contemplating whether he can abide serving the fire prophet. Vanifer and Halinaxus have a truce as they negotiate the terms of Halinaxuss assistance.</p>

He considers how he might someday take over. Halinaxus also loves the prizes Vanifer has hinted at giving him, so he is willing to bide his time and watch events unfold.</p>
<p>Halinaxus has an unobscured view of the fire portal (<strong>area W12</strong>) and the causeway leading up to it. If he spots one or more party members not dressed like fire cultists, he alights from his perch and lands on the causeway to cut off their escape. He then demands that the characters plead or pay for their lives. The dragon is supremely arrogant and doesn&rsquo;t suffer any disrepect from puny humanoids. If flattered and bribed to his satisfaction, he scoops up his newly won treasures and returns to his perch.</p>

<p>This titanic cavern is filled with a lake of gently undulating magma. A rough, uneven causeway of natural rock leads out into the middle, to a point where two crooked pillars of glassy black rock jut up on either side of a great altar of the same stone. Just beyond the altar, a gargantuan stone colossus rises from the lava to its waist, its head thrown back as if in agony. Tears of lava stream down its face, and lava wells from its gaping mouth. Above the colossuss head hovers a great orb of fire and light-a miniature sun with motes of fire swirling around it. The ceiling is another twenty feet up, at least one hundred feet overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Vanifer has been defeated, Halinaxus (see <strong>area W11</strong>) guards the fire portal and fights to the death to protect it. A fire elemental myrmidon (see chapter 7) stands before the altar in plain view, rushing forward to attack anyone other than Vanifer who approaches the portal. If Vanifer has retreated to this cavern and the characters have defeated two other prophets, use the &ldquo;Encounter with Vanifer&rdquo; section. Use the &ldquo;Encounter with Imix&rdquo; section if Vanifer is the last remaining prophet. In either case, the myrmidon isn&rsquo;t present.</p>

Incinerath, a fire elemental with 150 hit points, protects Vanifer. The elemental considers itself an avatar of Imix. Vanifer prefers to let Halinaxus and Incinerath fight while she casts spells from behind a wall of fire.</p>
<p>Vanifer doesn&rsquo;t dissemble, ask for mercy, or try to escape. Instead, she is sly and contemptuous. Halinaxus and Incinerath are arrogant blowhards but fearless in battle.</p>
<p>If Vanifer is defeated, she turns to smoke with a mournful scream and dissipates. <wc-fetch type=item>Tinderstrike</wc-fetch> falls to the ground, and the portal remains.</p>

When the characters arrive, Vanifer holds <wc-fetch type=item>Tinderstrike</wc-fetch> aloft and cries, &ldquo;With this key, I call forth my master, the Eternal Flame!&rdquo; The fire portal flares, and a gout of flame strikes Incinerath. With a howl of glee, the elemental transforms into Imix (see chapter 7). The Prince of Evil Elemental Fire then focuses on destroying the characters with little concern for the consequences to Vanifer. Imix wants to annihilate the characters, but he also knows he must keep the fire portal open. He summons fire elementals to aid him.</p>

It leads to the Elemental Plane of Fire, where Imix dwells. Imix attacks any enemy who comes through the portal. However, he cant pursue them into the world until the proper ritual is complete.</p>
<p>Characters can close the portal only by hurling <wc-fetch type=item>Tinderstrike</wc-fetch> into it. Once struck, the portal flares, consumes <wc-fetch type=item>Tinderstrike</wc-fetch>, and implodes. It sucks all fire elementals, including Imix, back to the Elemental Plane of Fire. With the portal collapsed, the node gradually returns to its natural state. A small river of lava still flows from <strong>area W1</strong> through areas W3, W4, W7, and W11 into <strong>area W12</strong>. The Weeping Colossus might remain, or the closing of the portal might shatter the stone titan.</p>

Over the next few months, the region returns to its tranquil state. Its still a frontier, but monster predations and banditry decline. The weather returns to normal, even if the people of Red Larch point out that &ldquo;normal weather means bad weather around here, and unpredictable besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some tavern talk can be overheard about occupying the Haunted Keeps to scare away unwanted squatters, or razing the forts once and for all. No power in the valley has the soldiers to accomplish the task, so nothing comes of it unless the characters take action.</p>
<p>Remaining cultists slink away and disperse within a tenday of the cults defeat. Bereft of leadership and reeling from the events, the cultists decide the Dessarin Valley isn&rsquo;t the place for them. Some go to nearby cities, especially Waterdeep and Neverwinter, and attempt to hide amid the bustle as they rebuild their ranks. Any monsters loyal to the cult are free to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>The characters can become involved in a mop-up effort against the cult remnants.</p>

The triumphant prince remains near the node for several weeks, reorganizing its cult and bringing the scattered remnants of the other cults to heel. This time allows the characters to plan a second assault.</p>
<p>The factions the characters are affiliated with take a more active role in thwarting Elemental Evil. Reports from characters who survived the first battle carry great weight with them, and its possible that a faction was scrying near the node at just the right time and saw how the battle unfolded. If the characters need better gear or spells cast on their behalf, the factions get to work. No one wants a second assault to fail for lack of potions of fire resistance, for example.</p>
<p>The ranks of the cult are depleted, and they cant be refilled until word spreads about the arrival of an elemental prince. Characters know what to expect, but the Prince of Elemental Evil is arrogant and disdainful enough to carry on just as he or she did in the first battle.</p>

The characters can expect more tangible aid from the factions in the future. Were it not for the characters, the Dessarin Valley would be a bastion of evil that was bound to spread across the North.</p>
<p>A closer connection with faction leaders cuts both ways. If the characters stopped Elemental Evil in its tracks, just think of all the other threats and rivals one could deploy them against. The characters have proved themselves capable of mighty deeds, and now thats what the factions expect.</p>
<p>If the characters victory was less complete, the factions goad them to finish the job. For example, the characters might have left elemental nodes open. All five factions are strident about getting those nodes closed, though their reasons, methods, and encouragements vary.</p>

However, it hasnt been completely expunged. The four cults were a promising incarnation of Elemental Evil, but they ultimately failed the test placed before them.</p>
<p>The next time the Elder Elemental Eye stirs in the Dessarin Valley, it doesn&rsquo;t choose relative newcomers like humans to do its bidding. It turns to the drow, who built it a shrine beneath the Sumber Hills thousands of years ago. The drow cult rises again, returns to the Fane of the Eye, and starts undermining drow society. If the drow fall under the sway of Elemental Evil, the surface world will need experienced characters to face this new threat.</p>
