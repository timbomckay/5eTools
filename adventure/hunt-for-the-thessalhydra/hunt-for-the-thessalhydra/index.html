As long as everyone&rsquo;s having fun, let it take as long as necessary. It&rsquo;s all about the fun.</p>
<p>Describe each scene. Tell them what their characters see or hear or feel at the start, then just let them go. They say what the characters do, and I tell them what happens. But don&rsquo;t take control of their characters. I control everything else—the monsters, the nonplayer characters (NPCs, like Sir Tristan), even the environment (like traps)—and the dice reveal how things turn out!</p>
<p>All creatures written with an underline can be found in the Monsters section of the rulebook.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry too much about getting the rules right or being perfect as a DM (that&rsquo;s short for Dungeon Master). Just relax, let things happen naturally, and enjoy playing the game. If things get confusing—especially in combat—do what seems fair and move on.</p>
<p>Like the rulebook says, my job as DM is to make sure everyone has a good time and that the story moves along smoothly.</p>

A terrible monster called a thessalhydra has been attacking his realm. It is a strange and dreadful creature with eight heads surrounding a large circular mouth rimmed with jagged teeth. Its maw drips with acid, and its tail ends in a pair of sharp pincers. Tristan asks the characters to get rid of this menace.</p>
<p>The thessalhydra was last seen going into caverns belonging to an unfriendly tribe of troglodytes. The characters must enter the caverns and deal with the stinky trogs. Following the thessalhydra&rsquo;s trail leads them into a cursed labyrinth, where they meet the Lost Knight. He will help them escape only if they prove themselves worthy by solving his riddles.</p>
<p>The way to escape from the labyrinth is through a portal into a strange, dark, parallel dimension called the Upside Down. There the characters meet the Proud Princess, a powerful adventurer who has her own quest and wants nothing to do with the characters. She shows them the way out of the Upside Down and into the thessalhydra&rsquo;s lair.</p>
<p>If the characters can beat the thessalhydra and bring its heads back to Sir Tristan, they have successfully finished this adventure.</p>

The characters have met Tristan before. He sponsored them on an earlier adventure and proved himself to be a kind ruler to his people and a good friend to the characters. They can trust him.</p>
<p>Sir Tristan says that lately a monster called a thessalhydra appears out of nowhere and attacks local farms, villages, and even Tristan&rsquo;s castle. All his soldiers together could barely fight it off. After each attack, the thessalhydra disappears into the woods and leaves no trail.</p>
<p>Tristan can&rsquo;t send his guards after the monster. They must protect the castle (and they know they&rsquo;re not strong enough to beat the monster). He asks the characters to hunt down and kill the thessalhydra, then return with its heads. (Tristan wants them stuffed and mounted over his throne.)</p>
<p>This scene is all about conversation. The characters are talking directly to Sir Tristan, but there are others here too—royal advisors, guards who fought the monster, and such. They treat the characters well—they&rsquo;re the heroes Sir Tristan turns to in his time of need. Give them confidence to take bold action (sometimes Will needs to be reminded that he&rsquo;s playing a character, not just himself).</p>

Begin by offering 100 gold pieces each and let them negotiate if they want more. If the group gets too greedy, Sir Tristan reminds them that they&rsquo;re old friends.</p>
<p>Once the deal is struck, Sir Tristan might have a surprise for the group. If the characters negotiated a fair deal and respected their friendship with Sir Tristan, he will give them some magic equipment that will be useful in this adventure. If they were greedy or acted like they didn&rsquo;t care about their friendship with Sir Tristan, he won&rsquo;t give them anything extra.</p>
<p>He starts with two <wc-fetch type=item>Bag of Holding</wc-fetch>, so that they can easily carry the thessalhydra&rsquo;s severed heads. Then, for each character, he provides a <wc-fetch type=item>ring of protection</wc-fetch> and a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of healing</wc-fetch>. Finally, he has two weapons—a <wc-fetch type=item>wand of magic missiles</wc-fetch> and this greatsword:</p>
<p><wc-fetch type=item>Winter&rsquo;s Dark Bite</wc-fetch>. This greatsword is made of an unknown black metal. In most cases, it works as a <wc-fetch type=item>+1 greatsword</wc-fetch>. But when used against a thessalhydra, it works as a <wc-fetch type=item>+3 greatsword</wc-fetch>. While in the Upside Down, it works as a +4 greatsword.</p>

Give them a few short roleplaying encounters. Some NPCs have useful info, and others are just distractions. But make sure the scenes are fun, or the group might ignore them (especially Lucas—he&rsquo;ll want to be all business).</p>
<ul>
<li>A merchant offers them one apple each. He says that local apples tasted better before the thessalhydra arrived. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s sure the monster&rsquo;s lair is in the apple orchards to the north.</li>
<li>A traveling priest says that often lesser monsters worship bigger ones. There are troglodytes in a nearby set of caverns. They might know something about the thessalhydra.</li>
<li>A woodcutter warns them that some of the caves around here are cursed. &ldquo;Once you enter, you get lost in the twisting tunnels and never escape.&rdquo;</li>
<li>An elderly farmer doesn&rsquo;t believe there is a thessalhydra. He thinks it&rsquo;s just a big owlbear that is raiding settlements for its supper. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never seen no thessalhydra, but owlbears we got plenty of around here!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>When the players start getting bored with roleplaying encounters, it&rsquo;s time for them to find the troglodyte caves. If they&rsquo;ve wandered off following false leads, just have them luckily stumble upon the right cave.</p>

<p>If the check succeeds, they have arrived at the troglodyte caves. Use the map to describe what the characters see. Let them pick in what order they explore the caves. When they reach a numbered area, see that area&rsquo;s description on the map below.</p>
<p>If the skill check fails, they still arrive at the caves, but unluckily do so at the same time as a returning hunting party of 8 Troglodyte. They must defeat the hunting party before they can enter the caves.</p>

But if the group angers him, all the trogs attack and fight to the death. If the group politely asks about the thessalhydra, he&rsquo;ll say that it comes in from the woods, passes through the caves, and enters the Cursed Labyrinth. It never travels the opposite way.</p>

</p>
<p>The knight is at the far end of a long hallway (60 feet from the group). He says he knows their quest is to slay a great monster. He&rsquo;ll help them if they solve his two riddles.</p>
<p>The <strong>first riddle</strong> is simple. All they have to do is catch him. He runs around the corner and calls back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At my heels you nip in this game we play. But cursed is the maze, and lost am I. So who&rsquo;s chasing whom? Oh, who&rsquo;s to say? The front is the back. Hello is goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters chase him, use the Random Path table to generate the hallways (reroll results of 1 and 2). Every time they round a corner, they see him escape at the other end of the hall.</p>
<p>The solution is to stop chasing the Lost Knight, turn around, and go back the way they came. Once the group goes back one room, they automatically find the Knight&rsquo;s second riddle.</p>

<p>In the room is a large table covered with many small statues, including a cake, a pie, a spinning wheel, a basket of laundry, a plate with a steak, a toy soldier, a sword, and twenty-four sculptures of crows.</p>
<p>To solve the riddle, the characters must put the right statue from the table in the empty space on shelf 3. If they put a wrong sculpture on the shelf, everyone in the room takes <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> lightning damage. They must try again. If they put the right statue there, the door opens.</p>

<p>The knight explains that the Cursed Labyrinth is not in our world. It is built in a demiplane. The thessalhydra has found a way to push through it to a place called the Upside Down. The Lost Knight shows the characters how that is done, but warns that this is a one-way passage—they&rsquo;ll have to find a different way home.</p>

That means in some ways it&rsquo;s very similar to our world, but in others it&rsquo;s completely different.</p>
<p>The Upside Down is a cold, dark place. It&rsquo;s always night there, and the air is always cold (like just before a snow storm). You never feel warm in the Upside Down. Also, characters get no natural healing while in the Upside Down: no matter how long you rest, you don&rsquo;t regain any hit points, and you can&rsquo;t spend Hit Dice. Magical healing still works.</p>
<p>In places where our world and the Upside Down touch each other, the Upside Down looks like our world—the same buildings, trees, and other structures—but they&rsquo;re always broken and ruined. These are the places where you can cross between planes, if you know how.</p>
<p>In places where the worlds don&rsquo;t touch, the Upside Down looks like a haunted forest.</p>

When the characters first arrive in the Upside Down, make it in the middle of the woods (an area that doesn&rsquo;t touch our world). Describe how lonely, dark, and desolate it is, with a cold wind blowing all the time.</p>
<p>Let the characters explore a little. Describe sections where the Upside Down touches our world in places that the group has already visited, so they can see scary, haunted versions. Have there be strange howling noises on the wind, and make it feel like something is stalking them, lurking just out of sight in the darkness.</p>
<p>They find tracks made by the thessalhydra, but also tracks made by other monsters. But the tracks are impossible to follow. The tracks come and go. Sometimes they loop back on themselves. None of it makes any sense.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s time to move the story forward, introduce the Proud Princess.</p>

She is strong and proud, a warrior princess, who looks at the characters and instantly knows that they pose no danger to her. (No stats for her. She&rsquo;s not someone they should fight. If they insist on trying, they can hit her only with a critical hit, and even then she shrugs off whatever damage they do. Her attacks always hit them and deal <wc-roll>2d6 + 6</wc-roll> slashing damage.)</p>
<p>The Proud Princess has a quest of her own, though she will not talk about the details. She warns the characters to stay out of her way, for their own safety. Simply to keep them away, she tells them how to find the thessalhydra.</p>
<p class="has-image block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</p>
<p>The thessalhydra uses the Upside Down as a way to return to its lair without being tracked. The lair is a cave where the Material Plane and the Upside Down touch. A special plant grows there—a plant whose flowers bloom in both worlds. These flowers can be used to cross between worlds if you perform a certain ritual. A key component of this ritual is blood from a monstrosity (a type of creature). The thessalhydra is a monstrosity, so it can use its own blood to open a gateway.</p>
<p>The Proud Princess can point them to the cavern where the flowers grow, but if the characters want to open a gateway, they&rsquo;ll also need the blood of a monstrosity. Luckily, she knows of one that has been stalking around the Upside Down lately: a demogorgon!</p>
<p>She tells them that the demogorgon is attracted to the smell of blood. The easiest way to get its attention is to spill blood on the ground. But since there are so few creatures in the Upside Down, the only source is the characters themselves. Using a weapon carefully, a character can do minor damage (cutting their palm) causing 1 hp of damage and spilling a small amount of blood. If the group spills a total of 3 hp worth of blood, the demogorgon will arrive <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> minutes later, leaping from the darkness and attacking the group.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t want to spill their own blood, they can stalk the demogorgon, but this is very difficult. One character should try a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check for the group. If this is successful, they have found the demogorgon. If it fails, the group may try again (with the same character or a different one making the check). If the group fails three times, the demogorgon has found them and attacks, but the characters are surprised (see chapter 2 of the rulebook for how surprise works).</p>

</p>
<p>A demogorgon is a monstrosity the size and shape of an adult human, but its mouth fills its face and opens like a blooming flower. One currently lives in the Upside Down, and no one knows where it came from originally. It&rsquo;s incredibly strong and can heal itself from damage it takes (even here in the Upside Down). Like a shark, a demogorgon is drawn to the scent of blood, and goes into a frenzy when blood is near.</p>
<p>The Proud Princess says that they need a few ounces of blood from the creature to open a gateway (filling an empty potion vial will do nicely, but let the characters solve the problem). If the demogorgon is killed, they can get the blood easily. But let them try other ways if they don&rsquo;t want to fight to the death. For example, they can get blood off a sword blade immediately after it strikes and damages the creature (they must do this four times to get enough blood).</p>

Stepping through leads to area 1 of the lair of the thessalhydra.</p>

<p>When the characters step out of an oversized flower (like the one they stepped into in the Upside Down), they are back in the Material Plane—home. In fact, they are pretty close to Sir Tristan&rsquo;s castle (they can see the towers above the tree line). Prints in the dirt make it clear that the thessalhydra has come this way often, and the tracks lead into a nearby cave.</p>

It is here and sleeping. If the characters can sneak up on it, they can take the creature by surprise (see chapter 2 of the rulebook for how surprise works).</p>

When they chop off the creature&rsquo;s heads and bring them back to Sir Tristan, he will welcome them as conquering heroes, shower them with treasure, and grant each one a boon (as long as it is within his power to do so). Additionally, in area 6 of the thessalhydra&rsquo;s lair they will find coins, gems, and artwork worth 1,000 gold pieces, plus one magic item of your (the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s) choice.</p>

Use the information in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook to make them 4th level. They will then be ready to seek more adventure and rewards in future games of Dungeons & Dragons!</p>
