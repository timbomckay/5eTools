<p>Sequestered among the crags of the Spine of the World is a grim fortress hewn out of rock. This fortress is home to Xardorok Sunblight, his two living sons, and the rest of the Sunblight duergar clan. It is a heavily defended gateway between the clan&rsquo;s former home in the Underdark and its future home in Icewind Dale. From here, Xardorok plots the destruction of Ten-Towns.</p>
<p>Xardorok has no imagination of his own. Instead, he receives inspiration from his patron, whom he believes is Deep Duerra (the duergar god of conquest). Unknown to Xardorok, his warlock powers come from Asmodeus, the Lord of the Nine Hells, who enjoys impersonating other gods. It is Asmodeus, not Deep Duerra, who inspired Xardorok Sunblight to become the first duergar to leave the Underdark and carve out a kingdom for himself on the surface.</p>

This chapter describes the fortress of Sunblight in detail, in the event the adventurers decide to attack it. But the characters are in for a surprise: by the time they arrive, Xardorok has already finished his construct and set it loose, leaving the characters with an agonizing decision: press the attack against the duergar fortress, or intercept the dragon in Ten-Towns. If they choose the latter course, skip over this chapter for now and proceed withchapter 4.</p>
<p>The characters are more likely to survive an invasion of Xardorok&rsquo;s fortress if they are at least 4th level. Characters of lower level can succeed if they take frequent rests or have an edge, such as plenty of healing magic or allies to back them up.</p>
<h3 id=speakers-quest>
<a href=#speakers-quest class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Speaker&rsquo;s Quest</h3><p>If the characters lack incentive to confront Xardorok in his fortress, either because they didn&rsquo;t encounter his sons in chapter 1 or because the duergar threat hasn&rsquo;t impacted them yet, you can have one of the speakers in Ten-Towns invite them to a private meeting. The speaker would know the characters by reputation, if nothing else. At this meeting, the speaker presents the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Invisible enemies walk among us. We have seen their boot prints in the snow, and now we know what they are: duergar. These malevolent dwarves of the Underdark have infiltrated Ten-Towns in search of a rare crystal known as chardalyn. With it, they&rsquo;re building a mighty construct that will lay waste to Ten-Towns if nothing is done to stop it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our militia captured one of the duergar and forced it to divulge the location of their mountain stronghold. Therein you will find a duergar warlord named Xardorok Sunblight. He aims to conquer Icewind Dale and destroy us all. For the good of Ten-Towns, will you penetrate the duergar fortress, slay this evil warlord, and destroy his terrible weapon?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters accept this quest, the speaker provides them with a map of Icewind Dale that marks the location of the duergar fortress, as shown on map 2.1 (see &ldquo;Map 2.1 Icewind Dale&rdquo;). For the benefit of your players, you can point to the fortress&rsquo;s location using the poster map of Icewind Dale.</p>
<p>If the characters ask to speak with the captured duergar, the speaker informs them that the duergar was put to death following the interrogation, to keep him escaping and warning his kin. If the characters insist on seeing the duergar, the speaker takes them to a cellar where the body is being kept. Any character who casts a <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> spell on the dead duergar can validate the information that the speaker has already imparted.</p>
<p>The speaker has little to offer the characters as recompense beyond hospitality and friendship. If the characters insist on a more tangible reward, the speaker scowls, apologizes for misjudging them, and lets them go about their business. Their reputation takes a blow if they decline to help. Regardless of the meeting&rsquo;s outcome, the speaker&rsquo;s next task is to prepare the settlement for what will surely be the fight of its life, in the event that Xardorok&rsquo;s construct attacks Ten-Towns.</p>

<h4 id=xardoroks-paranoia>
<a href=#xardoroks-paranoia class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Xardorok&rsquo;s Paranoia</h4><p>Xardorok&rsquo;s obsession with chardalyn is a form of madness that has consumed the duergar warlock, to the extent that he will stop at nothing to obtain all of it. Xardorok prizes chardalyn more than he loves his sons and his clan, which has alienated his closest advisors and forced them to question their blind obedience to him.</p>
<p>Prolonged contact with malevolent magic suffusing the chardalyn has made Xardorok extraordinarily paranoid. He keeps his two sons, Durth and Nildar, as far away from him as possible, sending them on dangerous missions to acquire more chardalyn in and around Ten-Towns, fearing that they might usurp his throne otherwise. Xardorok rewards his subjects for spying on one another and uncovering plots against him. The duergar closest to him are aware of the changes in his demeanor, but they lack the courage to stand up to him. A few have learned to capitalize on his paranoia, gaining Xardorok&rsquo;s favor by fabricating evidence of coups orchestrated by their rivals.</p>
<h4 id=the-muzgardt-conspiracy>
<a href=#the-muzgardt-conspiracy class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Muzgardt Conspiracy</h4><p>Grandolpha Muzgardt, the grand dame of the Muzgardt duergar clan, has recently arrived at the fortress after being invited here by Xardorok. The Muzgardts are based in Gracklstugh, a duergar city in the Underdark. They mass-produce and distribute a filthy duergar ale made from mushrooms. Xardorok has been eager to take a fourth wife and has had his eye on Grandolpha Muzgardt for many years. He asked Grandolpha to his fortress to give her a giftâa pseudodragon made of chardalyn (a pseudo-pseudodragon, if you will)âand make her an offer she can&rsquo;t refuse. Once he conquers Icewind Dale, he wants the Muzgardts to control the ale trade throughout his sunless surface kingdom.</p>
<p>Grandolpha, for her part, is too canny and jaded to fall for Xardorok&rsquo;s blunt attempt at seduction. She has begun plotting with disenfranchised advisors and warriors in his ranks to overthrow him when the moment is right. Ironically, despite his paranoia, Xardorok is too blinded by his admiration for Grandolpha to foresee her treachery. In Grandolpha, the characters might find an unlikely (if temporary) ally.</p>

Level advancement is handled as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters gain a level if they defeat Xardorok Sunblight.</li>
<li>The characters gain a level if they accomplish any two of the following feats: find the chardalyn dragon&rsquo;s flight plan in <strong>area area X4</strong>, free the myconid sovereign in <strong>area area X19</strong>, or destroy the heart of the red dragon in <strong>area area X24</strong>.</li>

They obtain a similar map if they accept the speaker&rsquo;s quest presented earlier in this chapter. If the characters fail to obtain the map, they can use magic to compel a captured duergar to divulge the location of the fortress.</p>

Use the rules in the &ldquo;<strong>area Mountain Travel</strong>&rdquo; section to simulate the perils of getting around in the peaks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the snowy foothills, low-lying clouds obscure the icy peaks of the gargantuan mountains that form the Spine of the World. Eventually, you get above the clouds and behold a sheer mountain wall rising more than a hundred feet before you. Carved high on the wall are rows of arrow slits with lights burning behind them and clanking sounds issuing from them. A narrow staircase hewn from the rock leads up along one side of the wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The steps leading up to it are barely 5 feet wide and climb 150 feet to a frost-covered shelf that adjoins the main entrance (<strong>area area X1</strong>).</p>
<h4 id=difficult-decision>
<a href=#difficult-decision class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Difficult Decision</h4><p>As the characters begin their ascent, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From high above comes a loud grinding noise as large sheets of ice break off the fortress walls and tumble down the mountainside. Suddenly, great doors of ice previously hidden under snow stand open more than three hundred feet above you, and from between them flies a huge dragon made of dark ice. Its eyes glow with a bright golden light as it lets out a terrible roar, hurls itself into the air, and glides away from the fortress, then turns and heads north toward Ten-Towns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chardalyn dragon (see appendix C) exits the fortress by climbing up a shaft that leads from the forge level to the fortress&rsquo;s summit. The doors at the top of the shaft remain open until the dragon returns or until someone closes them by using the levers in areas<strong>area X13</strong> and <strong>area X15</strong>.</p>
<p>The dragon stays at least 250 feet away from the party and does not pay any attention to the characters as it flies off on its mission to destroy Ten-Towns. Given the dragon&rsquo;s impressive flying speed, it&rsquo;s unlikely that the characters will be able to catch up to it.</p>
<p>The characters must now make a big decision: do they assault Xardorok&rsquo;s fortress as planned or follow the dragon back to Ten-Towns? If they continue their climb to the fortress, continue with the next section; if they pursue the dragon, move on to chapter 4.</p>

Unless the text notes otherwise, all areas are lightly obscured by this smoky haze.

</blockquote>
<p>Closer inspection of the drawing reveals that it&rsquo;s an accurate depiction of Ten-Towns and its environs. Mounted to the top of a thin iron stand on the table is a 6-inch-tall dragon figurine carved out of chardalynâa miniature version of Xardorok&rsquo;s chardalyn dragon, its wings outstretched. The figurine&rsquo;s stand is attached by an iron rod to a groove carved into the table, allowing the figurine to move across the map from one settlement to another. If a lever on the west side of the table is pulled, the dragon figurine &ldquo;flies&rdquo; over Ten-Towns on its preset course. Any character who pays close attention can discern the flight path of Xardorok&rsquo;s chardalyn dragon (see chapter 4 for details).</p>

A shelf embedded in the south wall holds a 2-foot-tall statuette of Deep Duerra made of chardalyn. It depicts a nude female duergar with no facial features and a spiked crown atop her bald head. Stacked on smaller shelves around the statuette are seven mind flayer skulls. A character can identify the depiction with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check. An indentation in the statuette&rsquo;s base holds the key that unlocks the iron trunk in Xardorok&rsquo;s bedchamber. The characters can find the key if someone lifts the statuette and looks underneath it.</p>
<p>Anyone other than Xardorok who touches the statuette of Deep Duerra must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 (<wc-roll>4d8</wc-roll>) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Along with the psychic damage comes a terrible sensation of having one&rsquo;s brain devoured by an illithid. Once this effect has occurred, the statuette can be handled safely.

If all its contents are removed, hidden springs raise the trunk&rsquo;s false bottom to rise slightly, at which point the stone visage above the bed opens its mouth and belches a cloud of poisonous gas large enough to fill the room. The gas hangs in the air for 10 minutes, then dissipates. Any creature that starts its turn in the cloud must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

Dreck has secretly pledged his allegiance to Grandolpha Muzgardt, for he longs to be rid of Xardorok Sunblight and now sees the characters as instruments of Xardorok&rsquo;s demise.

<p>Three braziers heaped with glowing-hot coals illuminate and heat this long hall. At the eastern end is a hexagonal stone table surrounded by six stone chairs. Seated in the chair facing the door is a haggard old duergar with long black hair streaked with ribbons of white and fingernails like shards of iron. She is devouring a hearty buffet of cooked meats, mushrooms, and strange Underdark fare. Lurking next to her is a small mechanical dragon made of a shiny black substance.</p>
<p>Hunched over a hot stove in the west side of the room are three duergar cooks. At the sight of you, they drop their utensils and reach for their weapons, but the old duergar says something in Dwarvish that keeps them at bay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Xardorok and his sons dine here, occasionally joined by guests. In attendance today is Xardorok&rsquo;s paramour, Grandolpha Muzgardt (see the accompanying stat block). The three duergar cooks are Grandolpha&rsquo;s loyal bodyguards. The chardalyn dragonet next to Grandolpha is a gift from Xardorok; it&rsquo;s a lawful evil construct that understands Draconic and Dwarvish but can&rsquo;t speak. It otherwise has the statistics of a pseudodragon.</p>
<p>After telling her bodyguards to stand down, Grandolpha invites the characters to join her for dinner. The main course is a cooked intellect devourer, its brain-body stewing in its own juices. The characters can partake of the feast that Grandolpha&rsquo;s guards have prepared, but the food has a thin layer of ash covering it that spoils the taste. Grandolpha doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind, though. She also offers the characters a vile Muzgardt brew made from Underdark mushrooms, which she pours from a jug on the table before her.</p>
<p>Grandolpha has no stake in Xardorok&rsquo;s plot to conquer Icewind Dale and does nothing to help or hinder his efforts. If the characters threaten her, she laughs at their audacity and refuses to meet their demands. If the characters ask for her help, she shares the following information with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>She doesn&rsquo;t know Xardorok&rsquo;s current whereabouts but assumes he&rsquo;s in the forge (<strong>area area X24</strong>) on the lowest level of the fortress.</li>
<li>Xardorok has programmed his chardalyn dragon to follow a prearranged flight plan. The characters can view the dragon&rsquo;s route in Xardorok&rsquo;s war room (<strong>area area X4</strong>).</li>
<li>Xardorok is capturing Underdark monsters, which he plans to unleash upon Icewind Dale. He has also captured a myconid sovereign and is using its spores to reanimate corpses.</li>
<li>Xardorok has proposed an alliance between his clan and the Muzgardt clan. Grandolpha is entertaining Xardorok&rsquo;s offer but hasn&rsquo;t agreed to anything. The mechanical pseudodragon was a gift from Xardorok, designed to win Grandolpha&rsquo;s affection.</li>
<li>Given time, Grandolpha thinks she can turn most of the Sunblight duergar against Xardorok. Several of them have already pledged their loyalty to her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before entering combat, Grandolpha casts <wc-fetch type=spell>stoneskin</wc-fetch> on herself. Once her guards come to her rescue, she withdraws from combat and uses her <wc-fetch type=spell>faerie fire</wc-fetch> spell to make enemies easier for her guards to hit. The chardalyn pseudodragon defends Grandolpha to the death.</p>

Grandolpha suggests not killing the tadpole and instead proposes that it be allowed to grow into a full-sized slaad. &ldquo;Let Xardorok deal with it,&rdquo; she says. If the characters allow this to happen, the tadpole slinks away and finds a quiet corner of the fortress in which to grow, becoming a full-grown slaad within <wc-roll>2d12</wc-roll> hours.</p>

Describe him as a soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ceiling of this hall arches to a height of thirty feet. Stone steps lead up to a semicircular dais against the south wall. Atop the dais is a misshapen throne crudely carved out of black crystal. Small, crackling flames burn in braziers that occupy the room&rsquo;s corners.</p>
<p>Slumped near the east wall is a tall, bipedal fungus creature. Luminous spores float in the air around it. A savage, white-furred biped has torn off one of the creature&rsquo;s arms and is holding it while four other white-furred bipeds covered with fungal growths try to capture the floating spores in jugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Xardorok&rsquo;s garrison includes several quaggoth thralls. A little over a tenday ago, a quaggoth thonot named Krob helped the duergar capture a myconid sovereign in the Underdark. The sovereign&rsquo;s name is Pleurota. With Xardorok&rsquo;s consent, Krob is harvesting Pleurota&rsquo;s animating spores and using them to turn dead quaggoths into spore servants. When the myconid sovereign became uncooperative, Krob tore off one of its arms.</p>
<p>Thonot Krob uses the Quaggoth Thonot stat block with the modifications noted in the &ldquo;Variant: Quaggoth Thonot&rdquo; sidebar in the Monster Manual. He is joined in this room by four Quaggoth Spore Servant. Krob and the spore servants fight to the death. If Krob dies, one of the spore servants uses its next action to pour its jug of spores over Krob&rsquo;s corpse, turning it into a new spore servant.</p>
<p>Sounds of combat here bring reinforcements from <strong>area area X18</strong> (four duergar) and <strong>area area X20</strong> (four Quaggoth). All the duergar, including Xardorok if he&rsquo;s present, use Enlarge before joining the fight. If defeat seems likely, Xardorok retreats to <strong>area area X22</strong> and uses the elevator to make his way toward <strong>area area X8</strong>, where he hopes to enlist the aid of Grandolpha Muzgardt, unaware of her true intentions. Grandolpha goes along with Xardorok but won&rsquo;t aid him in a fight, allowing the characters to kill him. If Xardorok is gravely wounded and Grandolpha can kill him without putting herself in harm&rsquo;s way, she seizes the opportunity.</p>

Forge</h4><blockquote>
<p>Smoke fills this warm cavern, which has a ceiling that ranges from forty feet high down to twenty feet high along the south wall. The source of the smoke and heat is a ten-foot-tall stone forge shaped like a pyramid with its peak sheared off. Ripples of heat and flashes of firelight spew from the top of the forge, which emits a deep, pulsating heartbeat. A five-foot-deep trough extends east from the forge, with rows of black anvils on either side of the depression.</p>
<p>Overlooking the forge are four twenty-foot-tall guard towers with gray-skinned dwarves standing behind their low battlements. Stone stairs provide access to the tops of the two towers nearest the forge.</p>
<p>South of the forge is an enormous, five-foot-tall iron platform fitted with cranes and clamps, with short flights of iron stairs leading to the top of the platform. Surrounding it is a clean-up crew consisting of a female duergar with a horn and six hulking bipeds, their white fur stained with soot. They are tossing scraps into a cylindrical container. In the twenty-foot-high ceiling above this bin is a wide, rectangular hole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This encounter area is made up of several smaller locations within sight of one another. Area X24 is the forge itself. Area X25 is the iron platform where Xardorok&rsquo;s chardalyn dragon was assembled. Area X26 is the bottom of the shaft that the dragon uses to move up and out of the fortress. In addition, four guard towers ringed by 3-foot-high stone battlements look out over the area.</p>
<p>If Xardorok Sunblight (see appendix C) is here, he is standing atop the assembly platform (area X25), barking orders at the clean-up crew. Describe Xardorok as a soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.</p>
<p>The clean-up crew consists of the duergar forewoman, Thontara, and six Quaggoth. Thontara carries a horn that she uses as a loudspeaker; the iron key that unlocks the outer gate (area X23) is hidden inside a compartment in the heel of her left boot.</p>
<p>Three guards are stationed atop each towerâtwelve duergar in total. One guard on each tower is secretly loyal to Grandolpha Muzgardt (see &ldquo;<strong>area The Muzgardt Conspiracy</strong>"). If the characters engage in battle with Xardorok and appear to be winning, these duergar help by attacking the other duergar on their respective platforms; if Xardorok appears to be winning, these duergar stay out of the fight. The remaining duergar hurl javelins at foes from atop the towers, growing to Large size and switching to their war picks if forced into melee combat.</p>
<p>A fight here brings reinforcements from <strong>area area X28</strong>: three Duergar Hammerer (see appendix C).</p>
<p>If defeat seems likely, Xardorok retreats and makes his final stand in Deep Duerra&rsquo;s temple (<strong>area area X29</strong>).</p>

<p>Characters who get close enough to peer through the vents in the side of the forge can see that it contains a large, beating heart. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check reveals that the heart belongs to a red dragon and is clearly kept alive by magic. The forge grants the heart three-quarters cover. The heart is a Large object with AC 13, 27 hit points, vulnerability to cold damage, and immunity to fire and psychic damage. The heart stops beating when reduced to 0 hit points, rendering the forge inoperable.</p>

Dungeon</h4><p>Unless they are drawn to the forge by sounds of combat there, three Duergar Hammerer (see appendix C) are spaced equidistantly along this corridor. Their job is to prevent prisoners from escaping, but they attack anyone outside the cells whom they don&rsquo;t recognize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This dark corridor has narrow iron doors along the north wall and two similar doors at each end. An iron crossbar seals each door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the duergar hammerers have been defeated or lured elsewhere, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loud banging from one cell causes the bar on its door to tremble in its brackets. From another cell comes a gentle tapping sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After its bar is removed, each iron door pulls open to reveal a cramped cell with no furnishings.</p>
<p>The tapping comes from the cell of a doppelganger that was caught trying to infiltrate the fortress. This creature takes the form of a scrawny human in a dirty loincloth named Pekoe Quint. &ldquo;Pekoe&rdquo; claims to be a trapper from Dougan&rsquo;s Hole and has the small, malformed ears and pointy teeth typical of that town&rsquo;s inbred stock. Pekoe says that the duergar abducted him and asked him a lot of questions about his town&rsquo;s defenses.</p>
<p>The doppelganger knows the settlements of Ten-Towns well enough to pass for a Ten-Towner. Any character who doubts Pekoe&rsquo;s story can make a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check; if the character&rsquo;s check result is higher than the doppelganger&rsquo;s Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check result, the character senses that something is off about Pekoe but can&rsquo;t tell what. The doppelganger tries to acquire some cold weather clothing and remains with the party until it reaches Ten-Towns. Once there, it slips away and adopts a new disguise. The doppelganger won&rsquo;t harm the characters unless they give it reason to.</p>
<p>The loud banging comes from an unarmed goliath warrior named Kapanuk Talltree Thuunlakalaga. After becoming separated from his hunting party during a blizzard, Kapanuk was ambushed by duergar and brought to the fortress for interrogation. Since he knows nothing about Ten-Towns, Kapanuk was of little use to his captors.</p>
<p>If released, Kapanuk tries to acquire some weapons and armor. He also invites the characters to return with him to Wyrmdoom Crag, where his kin will give them the heroes' feast they deserve. He shows no offense if the characters decline the invitation, but if they accept and are ready to leave, Kapanuk guides them through the mountains to his home (see &ldquo;<strong>area Wyrmdoom Crag</strong>").</p>
<p>You can add additional prisoners to the cellblock, at your discretion. The remaining cells are otherwise empty.</p>

<p>Standing in the middle of the room, facing the double door to the north, is a seven-foot-tall statue of a female duergar in a scale mail robe. The top of its head above the eyes has been sheared off, making a space for a stone brazier that gives off a flickering flame. Chained to the statue&rsquo;s pedestal is an emaciated, malformed creature with rubbery, purplish-gray flesh, a bulbous head with a metal plate bolted to it, and sinister eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Xardorok Sunblight (see appendix C) is here, he is kneeling before the statue and calling on Deep Duerra (speaking in Dwarvish) to grant him the power to conquer his foes.

Inspired by her mythic deeds, her priests are devoted to finding and annihilating mind flayer colonies or turning mind flayers into their thralls.</p>

<p>A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check recognizes the statue as a depiction of Deep Duerra (see the &ldquo;Deep Duerra&rdquo; sidebar). Dwarves have advantage on this check. The flame rising from the statue&rsquo;s head symbolizes Deep Duerra&rsquo;s destructive, all-consuming mind. If a creature uses an action to extinguish this fire, Xardorok loses his Psychic Conquest trait.</p>
<p>The creature chained to the statue&rsquo;s base is a mind flayer with 9 hit points and no armor (AC 11). Klondorn, the duergar priest (see area X31), has amputated its face-tentacles and removed the part of its brain that enables the mind flayer to use its psionic powers. Consequently, it has no innate spellcasting abilities and no effective attacks. It retains its Magic Resistance and its telepathy, however. Its challenge rating is 0 (0 XP).</p>
<p>The mind flayer doesn&rsquo;t expect sympathy from the characters and shies away from them. If the characters question it, the mind flayer shares the following information with one of them telepathically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mind flayer&rsquo;s name is F&rsquo;yorl. It was captured by the duergar in the Underdark.</li>
<li>This room is a temple dedicated to Deep Duerra, a duergar god of conquest and psionics. Xardorok comes here to pray and draws strength from the statue&rsquo;s flame.</li>
<li>The temple&rsquo;s priest, Klondorn, resides in the room to the southeast (<strong>area area X31</strong>).</li>

</p>
<p>Klondorn, the duergar priest of Deep Duerra and Xardorok&rsquo;s trusted advisor, is in fact a barbed devil. The devil&rsquo;s miter is a <wc-fetch type=item>hat of disguise</wc-fetch> that it uses to conceal its true form.</p>
<p>Klondorn is a fiendish emissary sent by Asmodeus to help Xardorok conquer Icewind Dale. Xardorok is unaware of Klondorn&rsquo;s true nature. In the guise of a duergar, the devil earned Xardorok&rsquo;s confidence and refuses to be intimidated by a stray band of adventurers. If the characters threaten Klondorn, it tosses aside the miter, revealing its true form, and attacks. If reduced to 0 hit points, the devil vanishes in a cloud of black smoke and returns to the Nine Hells, leaving its <wc-fetch type=item>hat of disguise</wc-fetch> behind.</p>

<p>Braziers of glowing-hot coals heat and light this room, the walls of which are lined with closed iron sarcophagi standing on end. In the middle of the room, a duergar has been shackled to a chair. Her flesh is covered with blisters. A pair of hooded duergar prod her with hot iron rods, searing her flesh and causing her to bellow in agony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unarmed and unarmored duergar shackled to the chair is Nefrun, the former captain of the guard. She has 7 hit points remaining. Her torturers are two Duergar Mind Master (see appendix C) wearing black hoods.</p>
<p>If Xardorok Sunblight (see appendix C) is encountered here, he&rsquo;s overseeing the torture of Nefrun, who has been implicated in a plot to assassinate him. Describe Xardorok as a soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.</p>
<p>The mind masters want their prisoner to identify others involved in the coup against Xardorok. Nefrun is refusing to cooperate and is not guilty of the crimes leveled against her. She suspects Klondorn, the high priest of Deep Duerra (see <strong>area area X31</strong>), has turned Xardorok against her. If she is released, Nefrun intends to demonstrate her loyalty to Xardorok. If that means betraying her liberators, Nefrun does so without question. Nefrun&rsquo;s gear, including her armors and weapons, is on the floor next to the chair.</p>
<p>Xardorok won&rsquo;t fight to the death in this area. Instead, he uses the secret door (see below) to retreat to <strong>area area X30</strong> and uses the elevator there to make his way toward <strong>area area X8</strong>, where he plans to join forces with Grandolpha Muzgardt. Grandolpha goes along with Xardorok but won&rsquo;t aid him in a fight, allowing the characters to kill him. If Xardorok is gravely wounded and Grandolpha can kill him without putting herself in harm&rsquo;s way, she seizes the opportunity.</p>

<p>Two beds stand against the south wall of this room, one of them with a yeti hide draped across it. At the foot of each bed is a stone chest next to a stack of five sealed copper kegs. The room is heated and illuminated by glowing coals in stone braziers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bedchamber is set aside for honored guests and is currently being used by Grandolpha Muzgardt, whom the characters encounter in <strong>area area X8</strong>. The yeti hide on her bed is a gift from Xardorok. The kegs contain Darklake Stout, Clan Muzgardt&rsquo;s finest mushroom ale, which Grandolpha brought with her from the Underdark. She keeps no valuables here, and both chests are empty.</p>

Duergar Hammerers</h4><blockquote>
<p>Two featureless stone pillars support the vaulted ceiling of this unlit chamber. East of the pillars, a duergar encased in an exoskeletal construct stands before a lowered iron portcullis. A similar creature stands in an alcove to the north, its squeaky pincers clenching and unclenching in nervous anticipation.</p>
<p>A stone lever juts out of the back wall of an alcove to the south.</p>

<p>The two Duergar Hammerer (appendix C) attack anyone they don&rsquo;t recognize.</p>

The plaque can&rsquo;t be removed from the wall. If the fingers and palm of Xardorok&rsquo;s gauntlet are placed in the indentation, the portcullis rises into the ceiling, allowing access to <strong>area area X37</strong>. The portcullis can also be raised with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. Brute force, in the form of a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check, also worksâbut circumventing the locking mechanism in this way causes the portcullises in area X37 to fall, sealing off that room&rsquo;s eight alcoves.</p>

Treasure Vault</h4><p>The characters can see into this room through the bars of the portcullis that blocks its entrance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This unlit room contains four alcoves on the north wall and four on the south wall. Inside each alcove is an iron chest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pointed teeth of a raised iron portcullis jut from the ceiling of each alcove. These barriers fall and lock into place if the characters physically forced open the portcullis that seals the vault&rsquo;s entrance. Placing the fingers and palm of Xardorok&rsquo;s gauntlet in the hand-shaped indentation in area X36 causes all the lowered portcullises in this room to rise. A portcullis can also be raised with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>

Xardorok keeps the combinations for these chests in his quarters (<strong>area area X5</strong>). A character using thieves' tools can spend 1 minute trying to disable the lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic also opens a chest. Here are the chests' descriptions:</p>
<p><strong>Chest 1</strong> contains a dozen stoppered gourds, each holding a pint of a fiercely hot liquor made from fire lichen, which grows in the Underdark. Each gourd can be sold to a tavernkeeper in Ten-Towns for 10 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Chest 2</strong> holds a gold mask shaped like the visage of a male drow (750 gp), lying on a bed of 350 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Chest 3</strong> contains a silver chalice shaped in the likeness of a spider and inlaid with eight obsidian eyes (250 gp).</p>
<p><strong>Chest 4</strong> holds a bundled-up gray spider-silk robe sewn with darkmantle eyes, wrapped inside which is a <wc-fetch type=item>wand of web</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p><strong>Chest 5</strong> contains a folded <wc-fetch type=item>Piwafwi (Cloak of Elvenkind)</wc-fetch>âa dark spider-silk cloak made by drow. This item has the properties of a <wc-fetch type=item>cloak of elvenkind</wc-fetch> but loses its magic if it&rsquo;s exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.</p>
<p><strong>Chest 6</strong> holds an amber headdress set with three large purple pearls (2,500 gp).</p>
<p><strong>Chest 7</strong> contains a 2-foot-tall stone statuette of Demogorgon that weighs 50 pounds. Anyone who looks into the statue&rsquo;s eyes must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or contract a random form of short-term madness (see &ldquo;indefinite madness&rdquo; in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). A creature can be affected only once by the statue, after which it becomes immune to the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Chest 8</strong> houses an inanimate svirfneblin skeleton encrusted with <wc-fetch type=hazard>yellow mold</wc-fetch> (see &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). The mold releases its spores as soon as the chest&rsquo;s lid is opened. Embedded in one of the skull&rsquo;s eye sockets is a false eye made of moonstone (75 gp).</p>
<h2 id=fortress-fallout>
<a href=#fortress-fallout class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Fortress Fallout</h2><p>The chardalyn dragon won&rsquo;t return to Xardorok&rsquo;s fortress until it has destroyed Ten-Towns (see the next chapter). If Xardorok is alive and his forge is intact when the dragon returns, Xardorok begins repairing it. The dragon regains <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> hit points at the end of each hour of repair work. If Xardorok is slain or the red dragon&rsquo;s heart in the forge is destroyed, the chardalyn dragon can&rsquo;t be repaired.</p>
<p>After returning to the fortress, the dragon remains there until such time as Xardorok needs it to cause more devastation, and certainly not before Xardorok&rsquo;s duergar scouts have assessed the damage to Ten-Towns.</p>
<p>Xardorok&rsquo;s demise spells the doom of the Sunblight clan if neither of his sons are alive to take command. If Grandolpha Muzgardt outlives Xardorok, she absorbs the remnants of the Sunblight clan into her own and has Xardorok&rsquo;s surviving sons executed. The Muzgardt clan takes over Xardorok&rsquo;s fortress but has no immediate designs against Ten-Towns or Icewind Dale. If the characters were instrumental in helping Grandolpha capture the fortress, she allows them to keep any treasures they found in the fortress but insists that they leave at once.</p>
<p>If Xardorok and Grandolpha are both still alive when the characters depart the fortress, the division among the two duergar clans continues to deepen, but no immediate effort is made to unseat Xardorok. Grandolpha is content to bide her time, betraying Xardorok only after some setback leaves him weak and vulnerable.</p>
