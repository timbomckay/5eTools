<p>Founded by Calishite settlers who appreciated beauty, Termalaine is widely regarded as the most picturesque town in Icewind Dale, spreading out from the shore of Maer Dualdon and bordered on the north and west by tall pines. Its buildings incorporate carvings of wizards, homunculi, tigers, and smiling djinn.</p>
<p>For most visitors, the enchantment of the town is dispelled as soon as they feel the icy claws and teeth of the cold wind sweeping down from the north, shearing through their layers of clothing. Termalaine was built in the path of this dreadful gale, which continues well past the town to harry fishers on the southern half of the lake.</p>
<p>In addition to fishers, shipbuilders, and scrimshanders, Termalaine is home to miners who harvest gemstones from a cavern complex set into a low hill north and east of the settlement. Their efforts are hampered by creatures from the Underdark that occasionally find their way up into the mine. Whenever such creatures are discovered, the mine is sealed off and the townsfolk wait until a band of sellswords or adventurers can be hired to clear it out.</p>

<p>The fishers of Termalaine typically finish their days here, seated on benches near one of the building&rsquo;s long hearths to warm their feet while they fill their bellies with spiced chowder. Beautiful works of scrimshaw are hung on the walls.</p>
<p>Vernon Braig (neutral good half-orc commoner), the Blue Clam&rsquo;s owner and chef, knows some of the hunters and trappers in Lonelywood, and occasionally a sled comes down the north trail with a sack of hares or a haunch of moose, courtesy of one of Vernon&rsquo;s friends. On those nights, the Blue Clam&rsquo;s hearths are full of roasting meat, and the patrons stay later and sing louder, enjoying the good times while they last.</p>
<p>Characters who loiter in the tavern are likely to hear a rumor or two, which you can determine by rolling on the Ten-Towns Rumors table (see &ldquo;<strong>area Ten-Towns Rumors</strong>").</p>

<p>The Eastside is where most visitors in town stay. What looks from the outside like separate houses turns out to be a single structure with rooms connected by underground passages, with cozy guest accommodations in the cellar.</p>
<p>The innkeeper is Marta Peskryk (lawful good human commoner), a willowy teenager who spends much of her time tending to her bedridden father, Clyde, a retired fisherman and noncombatant. As she performs her daily chores, Marta sings the following song to herself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahead of winter&rsquo;s wind she came‚Äî</p>
<p>The lovely woman with no name;</p>
<p>Draped in a fur-lined cloak of red,</p>
<p>To the icy lake she fled;</p>
<p>The wind pursued her all the same‚Äî</p>
<p>As sure as night she&rsquo;s dead.</p>

</span></p>
<p>If asked about the song, Marta recounts the following tale. Fifty years ago, a mysterious woman in a fur-lined red cloak stopped at the Eastside on her way to Lonelywood. Because the woman was alone and frightened, the innkeepers‚Äîa pair of retired adventurers who happened to be Marta&rsquo;s grandparents‚Äîtried to console her. The woman gave them a ring as payment for their hospitality. Not long afterward, a howling wind burst into the inn and tossed the woman about like a rag doll. The innkeepers intervened, giving the woman time to escape. The evil wind battered Marta&rsquo;s grandparents unconscious before resuming its hunt. That was the last anyone saw of the woman.</p>

As they trudge through the streets, they see a young boy standing on a box, yelling about various local happenings, including the recent evacuation of workers from a nearby mine that has been overrun by kobolds. A reward of 50 gp is offered to anyone who can rid the mine of the pesky dragonlings.</p>
<p>When the characters investigate, they discover that all is not what it seems. The kobold leader has been possessed by a ghost, and a grell has infiltrated the mine, setting the kobolds on edge. The characters can either try to parley with the kobolds and get them to leave the mine peacefully, or they can rid Ten-Towns of their presence permanently and try to deal with the grell on their own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A boy wrapped in heavy winter clothes shouts the news of the day as people pass by. When you approach, the boy cries, &ldquo;The gemstone mine is closed because of monsters! Speaker Masthew is offering fifty gold to anyone who clears it out!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters express interest, Darmo tells them they can find the town speaker, Oarus Masthew, at the Blue Clam. The boy also has some information about the mine, including its location. He doesn&rsquo;t know much about the history or the particulars of the mine, but he knows it&rsquo;s important for Termalaine and its closing means a significant loss of income.</p>
<p>The characters can make the half-hour trek to the mine without visiting Oarus, or they can go to the tavern to see the speaker. If the characters decide to ignore the quest, the mine remains closed for several weeks before the kobolds mysteriously vanish, enabling the miners to return. After the mine reopens, it isn&rsquo;t long before workers start disappearing one by one‚Äîvictims of the grell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Outside the tavern, you see two bundled-up humanoids talking to one another. When they see you, one waves to you in a friendly manner, then says, &ldquo;You seem entirely too prepared for trouble. Are you here about the mine?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The town speaker, Oarus Masthew (lawful good half-orc veteran), explains that a group of kobolds crept into the mine a few days ago, entering from the surface and forcing the miners to abandon their jobs. No one was killed, but the kobolds are too dangerous for the miners to deal with. He also reveals that a human miner went missing a few days before the kobolds showed up, prompting other miners to fear that a monster must have crawled up from the Underdark. Oarus thinks it&rsquo;s possible that the miner fell down the central shaft, which is deep enough that his body would never be found.</p>
<p>One piece of information that Oarus fails to mention is that he ordered the town militia to clear out the mine three days ago. The militia refused to deal with the problem for what amounts to political reasons. Senior officers in cahoots with Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos are determined to oust Masthew as town speaker and replace him with one of their own in a special election.

The characters can follow a trail from Termalaine and be there in 30 minutes. When they arrive, the area around the opening appears devoid of life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entrance to the gem mine is an open tunnel in a hillside. Empty carts are parked near the entrance, next to which a crude wooden sign has been propped up. Written on the sign in charcoal are the words &ldquo;Kobolds only!&rdquo; in Common.</p>

<p>The words are written in more elaborate calligraphy than would be expected from a kobold.</p>

Use the boxed text to describe the cave&rsquo;s other features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benches and tables are set up as workspaces where miners clean any gemstones they find. Gravel and pebbles are strewn on the ground. Scattered across the floor are a few hammers, picks, and broken lanterns.</p>

<p>Wooden planks and struts form a walkway along the wall of a seemingly bottomless vertical shaft. A narrow waterfall cascades down the northeast wall, and the sound of rushing water is loud in the confined space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters using <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> or a light source brighter than a candle can see more walkways attached to the northwest side of the shaft 30 feet farther down.

These kobolds, named Scorp and Thwip, are using saws to weaken the wooden struts so that the walkway will collapse if a creature weighing more than two kobolds tries to stand on it. These kobolds need another day to complete their sabotage; until then, the walkway is safe.</p>
<p>The characters can&rsquo;t hear the kobolds, but if they look underneath the planks, they can see the kobolds working away cheerily. If a kobold takes damage while clinging to the underside of the walkway, it loses its grip and falls down the shaft to its death.</p>

<p>A wooden pulley system has been constructed around a large hole in the floor. A bucket big enough to hold a humanoid is held up by thick rope. Three alcoves next to the lift contain wooden boards and mining equipment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bucket lift is used for hoisting miners and ore between levels 1 and 2. It&rsquo;s controlled by using a crank inside the bucket or the crank on the side of the pulley system. The bucket can hold one Medium creature or two Small creatures at a time. It runs from here to area M7, 15 feet farther down, and back again. It takes 1 minute for the bucket to be lowered or raised.</p>

<p>Characters who search for tracks in the dust and succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check can determine that a lot of kobold foot traffic leads to and comes from the west, and a single set of kobold footprints leads to the east.

<p>Floating near the 15-foot-high ceiling is a grell. A character who has a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 16 or higher notices the grell. If more than one character enters the cavern, the grell won&rsquo;t attack and tries to stay hidden. If the characters leave the cave, it follows them, always staying at least 30 feet away. When an opportunity to attack a lone party member presents itself, the grell swoops in and tries to paralyze its prey, then hauls its catch back here to be devoured. After it feeds, it drops the remains of its victim down the central shaft.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Two Icewind Kobold (see <strong>area appendix C</strong>) named Grek and Smol rush to attack when the characters enter the cave. If either one is injured, they immediately have a change of heart and flee through the tunnel to the north that leads to level 3.</p>

A crank mounted to each platform allows the bucket to be shuttled from one side to the other. A person inside the bucket can forgo the cranks and pull themselves across by tugging on the suspension rope. The bucket is large enough to hold one Medium creature or two Small creatures. It takes 1 round for the bucket to cross the gap between the platforms.</p>
<p>Dealing 5 acid, fire, or slashing damage to the rope causes it to snap. If the rope is cut, the bucket and its contents fall down the shaft, likely gone forever.

Kobold Tunnels</h4><blockquote>
<p>Lurking in this dusty tunnel are three skittish kobolds. One of them carries a threadbare satchel and wears a fake pair of dragon wings made of thin wood and tattered white cloth. This kobold immediately raises its hands in surrender, saying in Common, &ldquo;We mean you no harm. Please don&rsquo;t hurt us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two of these three Icewind Kobold (see <strong>area appendix C</strong>) are nervous bodyguards named Vott and Zurk. The one wearing the fake wings and doing the talking is Trex, the leader of the group. If one or both of the kobolds from <strong>area area M9</strong> fled from there, they lurk deeper inside the tunnel behind Trex and his bodyguards.</p>
<p>Trex is possessed by a ghost, though the characters won&rsquo;t know this until the ghost shows itself (see &ldquo;Janth&rsquo;s Ghost&rdquo; below). Speaking in fluent Common, Trex explains that he and his fellow kobolds sought refuge in the mine after being chased out of the foothills of Kelvin&rsquo;s Cairn by a yeti. The miners got scared and ran off before Trex could explain that the kobolds meant no harm. As long as Trex is possessed by the ghost, he has an impressive vocabulary and speaks only Common.</p>
<p>If the characters engage Trex in conversation, he makes a proposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The everlasting winter has made the wilderness unsafe for my kind, and the preternatural cold dulls our wits. Please, we only want a place to stay so we can keep out of this horrible weather. We can work, and we won&rsquo;t cause trouble. Termalaine would be richer for having us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check can tell that Trex is lying. The ghost controlling Trex wants safe access to Termalaine so that it can possess someone more powerful and influential than a kobold.</p>
<p>If the characters agree to take the kobolds in the mine back to Termalaine, the kobolds act as their allies.</p>

He and his guide were killed and decapitated by a yeti in the foothills of Kelvin&rsquo;s Cairn two years ago, and his restless spirit has lingered. The kobolds happened upon the ghost while searching for shelter during a blizzard, allowing it to possess Trex without the other kobolds' knowledge.</p>
<p>The threadbare satchel carried by Trex once belonged to Janth. It contains clumps of moss, lichen, and shrubbery gathered from the foothills of Kelvin&rsquo;s Cairn and the surrounding tundra. None of the samples are valuable, but the ghost is very possessive of the collection and won&rsquo;t give up its satchel without a fight.</p>
<p>Janth&rsquo;s ghost can be laid to rest by destroying the satchel‚Äîits last connection to the Material Plane. The ghost otherwise remains as close to the satchel as possible. If the satchel is taken from Trex and discarded, the ghost forsakes its current host and remains near the satchel, hoping to possess someone else.</p>
<p>If Trex is killed, the ghost appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the kobold&rsquo;s body. On its next turn, the ghost tries to possess one of the characters‚Äîpreferably one who can take up its satchel.</p>

<p>A fossilized skull partially juts out of the east wall of this small cave, five feet off the ground. The skull has larger than normal eye sockets, a curious ridge between the eyes, nothing that would pass for a nose, and four small holes where one would expect to see teeth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The skull embedded in the wall is that of a mind flayer that came up from the Underdark thousands of years ago. How it became lodged in the stone is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Any character who examines the skull and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check concludes that it came from a mind flayer. Any attempt to pry the skull from the stone causes it to shatter and fall away, revealing a crystal shard where the illithid&rsquo;s brain would have been.</p>

<p>A character who attunes to this <em>psi crystal</em> gains a form of indefinite madness (see theindefinite madness in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Determine the result secretly, then convey this information only to the character&rsquo;s player. The madness does not end until the character is no longer attuned to the <em>psi crystal</em>. While the madness lasts, the character can hear a repeating telepathic distress signal put out by an illithid ship that crashed in the mountains and track the signal to its source (see &ldquo;<strong>area Id Ascendant</strong>"). The only way to block the signal is by ending the character&rsquo;s attunement to the <em>psi crystal</em>.</p>

<p>If there are no more kobolds in the mine and the grell has likewise been dealt with, Oarus returns to the characters the next day and pays them 50 gp for their services. If Trex is still in the mine and Janth&rsquo;s ghost wasn&rsquo;t laid to rest, Oarus returns to Termalaine possessed by the ghost. If the kobolds are gone but the grell remains, Oarus is killed by the grell and doesn&rsquo;t return, leaving the town without a speaker. If the grell is still in the mine when it reopens, a handful of local miners disappear over the next few days before the decision is made to close the mine for good.</p>
<p>If the characters bring the kobolds to Termalaine, Oarus is initially hesitant to let them stay in the town. After hearing about their willingness to work, he decides to give them a chance and offers them menial jobs. The kobolds, eager to prove themselves, turn out to be good workers. The townsfolk tease them at first, but eventually the kobolds win them over. Janth&rsquo;s ghost, if it hasn&rsquo;t been laid to rest, finds someone else to possess, causing Trex to revert to his skittish, much less intelligent self.</p>
