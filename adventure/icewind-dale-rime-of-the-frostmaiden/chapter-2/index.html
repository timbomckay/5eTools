<div class="gap-8 lg:grid items-start" style="grid-template-columns:auto 10rem">
<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>Katabatic winds sweep down from the Reghed Glacier, ceaselessly battering anything that dares to grow or breathe in Icewind Dale. Without fail, these winds find their way through every chink and crack, every opening in the warmest furs, every tent flap, every roof and board of the strongest homes, draining away any hint of warmth.</p>
<p>The sun, held down below the horizon by the Frostmaiden&rsquo;s magic, offers no respite from winter&rsquo;s fury. The days are twilit, the nights dark. As Auril casts her nightly spell, a curtain of light weaves across the starry sky to keep the dawn at bayâ€”an aurora that portends an everlasting winter. Storms bring driving hail and sleet that leaves everything coated in a sheath of ice. Snow piles in deep drifts and blocks all trails leading south to warmer lands. The ice cliffs of the Reghed Glacier rise in the east like prison walls, while the snow-capped peaks of the Spine of the World loom to the south. North and west, the Sea of Moving Ice churns icebergs and floes in a deadly tumult, like winter grinding its teeth in anticipation of its next freezing assault.</p>
<p>Trapped in winter&rsquo;s cold embrace, nomadic humans follow herds of reindeer through their migrations, while others dare the treacherous waters of the Sea of Moving Ice in search of fish, seals, walruses, and whales to sustain them. Dwarves dig into the earth to seek shelter and mine for iron. Meanwhile, folk descended from foolhardy and treasure-mad immigrants eke out meager lives in Ten-Towns, which can barely hold back the wind, let alone marauding orcs, giants, and fierce tundra yeti.</p>
<p>Despite the unnatural cold and other dangers, people still brave the journey to reach this harsh winterscape, searching for opportunity and adventure.</p>

These adventure locations are scattered across Icewind Dale, as shown on map 2.1. Also marked on this map are the remote locations featured in chapters 3, 6, and 7.</p>

The characters might need to run away and regroup, or take short or long rests between encounters, if they&rsquo;re going to survive.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you decide how quickly the characters advance in level. Treat the following as recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters gain a level after spending two or three game sessions exploring Icewind Dale.</li>
<li>The characters gain a level for neutralizing the threats in two or three of the dangerous locations described in this chapter.</li>
<li>The characters gain a level if they accomplish an extraordinary feat, such as ending the feud between the goliath clans of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag, or surviving a close encounter with Arveiaturace the White Wyrm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the characters reach 7th level, they should no long gain levels by exploring locations or surviving random encounters in this chapter. Instead, direct them to the locations described in chapters 5 through 7.</p>

When the player characters are ready to explore more of Icewind Dale, use the Tall Tales in Ten-Towns table to entice them.</p>
<p>You can either choose which tales to share with the players, or you can ask each player to roll once on the table. Let the players decide which tales (if any) they want to investigate.</p>

<p>Ten-Towners need whale oil to keep their stoves and lamps lit, and most of that oil comes from whale hunters on the Sea of Moving Ice, which has grown more tempestuous and difficult to navigate in recent months. Helka Jaggerath (half-elf commoner), a whale oil merchant in Bryn Shander, hires the characters to serve as her bodyguards as she travel to Angajuk&rsquo;s Bell and rings the bell to summon the whale. There, they must help her persuade the awakened sperm whale to ferry them to the whalers camped on the ice floes of the Sea of Moving Ice so that Helka can buy as many casks of whale oil as she can.</p>
<p>Each cask of whale oil weighs 50 pounds and costs 25 gp. Helka has 300 gp, which is enough to buy six casks of whale oil and to pay the characters 150 gp for their help getting the casks safely back to Bryn Shander. She expects the entire expedition to last a tenday, assuming Angajuk cooperates. Helka cautions the characters not to tell Angajuk what&rsquo;s in the casks, since the truth might upset the whale. Her plan is to tell Angajuk that the casks contain fish oil, not whale oil.</p>

<p>Copper Knobberknocker, a gnome acolyte of Lathander staying at the House of the Morninglord in Bryn Shander (see &ldquo;<strong>area House of the Morninglord</strong>"), is worried about his friend, Macreadus, who&rsquo;s trying to build a device that can end the Everlasting Rime and return summer to Icewind Dale. Copper asks the characters to bring provisions to Macreadus at the Black Cabin and make sure he&rsquo;s all right. Because the gnome has paid for the provisions, he can&rsquo;t offer a reward; however, Mishann, the priest who runs the House of the Morninglord, offers free healing to those who complete Copper&rsquo;s quest and return.</p>

<p>Trovus, the dragonborn speaker of Caer-Konig, considers gnolls to be a clear and present danger to his town. He knows that a group of these savage predators has taken refuge in the Cackling Chasm and offers the characters 10 gp for each gnoll head they bring back to him.</p>

<p>The tavernkeepers of Five-Tavern Center in Bremen are bemoaning their dwindling supplies of ale and spirits, but they&rsquo;ve heard rumors of a pirate ship stuck in the ice off the coastâ€”and where there&rsquo;s a pirate ship, there might be rum! The tavernkeepers hire the characters to search the ship&rsquo;s hold and bring back any alcoholic beverages they find, offering to pay a fair price plus a 150 gp incentive. Although this quest cannot be completed, because the ship&rsquo;s crew left behind no rum or other alcoholic beverages for the characters to purloin, other treasures aboard the ship far surpass what the tavernkeepers of Bremen could offer as a reward, so the quest is not without merit.</p>

<p>The characters are approached by four psychically sensitive Ten-Towners (human Commoner) who have been kept awake by a telepathic distress signal that it seems only they can hear. They were drawn together by this common experience. They don&rsquo;t understand the message (which is in Deep Speech) but know the direction it&rsquo;s coming from. They offer the characters 250 gp to investigate the source of the signal and silence it, if only so they can get a good night&rsquo;s sleep. These Ten-Towners are briefly described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vedda Starsprit, a stocky, paranoid, 30-year-old trapper with exotropia</li>
<li>Nars Beldrun, a tall, heavyset, 33-year-old shipwright from Targos who complains about everything</li>
<li>Telvaster Hangingbell, a 25-year-old man from a well-off merchant family in Neverwinter, looking to escape his responsibilities</li>

<p>Yselm Bloodfang, a human frost druid (see appendix C), is a former Reghed nomad of the Tiger Tribe who gave up the nomadic lifestyle and settled in Ten-Towns three years ago, before Auril&rsquo;s everlasting winter beset Icewind Dale. A secret Auril worshiper, Yselm is known throughout Ten-Towns as a skilled wilderness guide. She recently encountered an avatar of the Frostmaidenâ€”a female figure made of snowâ€”that commanded her to find the characters and lead them to their doom. To that end, Yselm approaches the characters and claims to be looking for work. She tells them about Jarlmoot (&ldquo;a circle of giant thrones on a haunted hilltop&rdquo;) and offers to lead them there for 25 gp. &ldquo;On nights of the full moon,&rdquo; she adds, &ldquo;the spirit of Reggaryarva, jarl of jarls, will open his treasure vault to anyone who defeats his champion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yselm knows the way to Jarlmoot but doesn&rsquo;t help the characters fight any threats they encounter on the way, nor will she enter the circle of thrones or assist in the battle against Reggaryarva&rsquo;s champion. If the characters overcome the challenges posed by Reggaryarva, Yselm betrays and attacks them. A winter wolf sent by the Frostmaiden joins the fray on Yselm&rsquo;s side. Both villains fight to the death.</p>

<p>A goblin messenger from Karkolohk was recently captured in Bryn Shander and found to be carrying a declaration of peace from Chief Yarb-Gnock, addressed to Speaker Duvessa Shane. Yarb-Gnock would like Speaker Shane to send delegates to Karkolohk to conduct &ldquo;treaty negotiations.&rdquo; Sherriff Markham Southwell doesn&rsquo;t believe a word of Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s message and offers a reward of 300 gp for the goblin chieftain&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at Karkolohk, the characters discover that the declaration of peace is either a genuine attempt to end hostilities with Ten-Towns, or a desperate ploy by Yarb-Gnock to lure adventurers to Karkolohk to that they can help him escape. As the DM, you get to determine Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s true intentions (see &ldquo;<strong>area Gnome Diplomacy</strong>&rdquo; for more information).</p>

<p>Yeti are growing bold and striking closer to Ten-Towns than ever before, going so far as to venture onto frozen lakes to attack ice fishers. Local merchants who earn a living selling yeti hides and meat are offering up to 100 gp for every dead yeti brought back to Ten-Towns.</p>
<p>A hunter named Mylbor Tafferac (neutral evil human gladiator with <wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch> +7) has been scouring the tundra for the Red Yetiâ€”a yeti so terrifying and cruel that its fur is stained red with the blood of its kills. One night at a tavern, Mylbor bets the characters 300 gp that he&rsquo;ll find and kill the Red Yeti before they can. If the characters take the bet, the contest sparks excitement in taverns across Ten-Towns, leading to all sorts of side-betting.</p>
<p>The characters&rsquo; search for the Red Yeti leads to the accidental discovery of the Lost Spire of Netheril. Only after the characters explore the lost spire and return to Ten-Towns do they discover the Red Yeti is deadâ€”found and killed by the incomparable Mylbor Tafferac.</p>

<p>After several furriers and trappers disappear without a trace, a representative of the Wolf Tribe named Aluka (chaotic good werewolf in human form) comes to Ten-Towns with a warning: a Wolf Tribe camp under the command of an evil chieftain named Sangra Grisgir is resorting to cannibalism to survive. The furriers and trappers are merely the camp&rsquo;s latest victims, and more disappearances are likely to occur unless the cannibals are dealt with. Aluka gives directions to the camp, but she can&rsquo;t risk an all-out war within her tribe, hence her decision to let Ten-Towns and the characters deal with the problem.</p>
<p>The Wolf Tribe cannibals have eaten all their sled dogs and their elderly. Even the children have been forced to resort to cannibalism to survive. If the characters act quickly, they can save the life of a lightfoot halfling trapper (commoner) named Honeybee Littlebucket, who has managed to stay alive by convincing the Wolf tribesfolk that she can catch snowshoe hares for them to eat. So far, Honeybee&rsquo;s traps have caught nothing, and her time (and Chief Grisgir&rsquo;s patience) is quickly running out.</p>

<p>Duvessa Shane, the speaker of Bryn Shander, is worried about rumors that the Arcane Brotherhood has sent operatives to Ten-Towns. She suspects that Vaelish Gant, an Arcane Brotherhood wizard incarcerated at Revel&rsquo;s End, might have information to share. Duvessa asks the characters to question Gant and find out what he knows about Arcane Brotherhood activity in Ten-Towns, offering a reward of 250 gp if they obtain useful information. She also gives the party a signed letter notifying Gant that, in exchange for his cooperation, Duvessa will petition the Lords&rsquo; Alliance for a reduction in Gant&rsquo;s sentence. If the characters get nothing out of the prisoner, Duvessa asks them to inform the prison warden that the Arcane Brotherhood might be plotting a jailbreak to free Gant. While there are no indications that a jailbreak is imminent, Duvessa avails herself of this opportunity to make Gant&rsquo;s life worse.</p>

She recently dishonored herself by resorting to thievery to cover her gambling debts. Now she wants to atone. She asks the characters to help her return to Skytower Shelter and convince Arn, chieftain of the Akannathi clan, to put aside grievances and unite the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag toward a common purpose: bringing an end to the Frostmaiden&rsquo;s everlasting winter.

<p>Dannika Graysteel, a scholar whom the characters might know from an earlier quest (see &ldquo;<strong>area Starting Quest: Nature Spirits</strong>"), asks the characters to bring her some white dragon bones. Dannika has acquired a recipe for a magical stew that imparts the same benefit as a <wc-fetch type=item>Potion of Cold Resistance</wc-fetch>. She thinks she can make a good supply of the stew if she gets enough bones, which are the last ingredients she needs. Dannika has heard rumors that the bones of a white dragon can be found on a mountainside near Wyrmdoom Crag, and she suggests the characters travel there and beseech the goliaths of the crag to part with a few of the bones. Dannika will give her first batch of stew to the characters for free (the equivalent of one potion each) if they help her.</p>
<p>Although the recipe is genuine, Dannika doesn&rsquo;t realize that consuming dragon bone stew also causes madness, inflicting upon those who drink it the greed and paranoia of a dragon, which can be cured only by a <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>

The first <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> is the <strong>encounter die</strong>; the second <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> is the <strong>blizzard die</strong>. Use them as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll the encounter die and consult the Random Wilderness Encounters table to determine what the characters come across.</li>
<li>Roll the blizzard die and add 1. If this total is higher than the encounter die roll, the encounter takes place during a blizzard (see &ldquo;<strong>area Blizzards</strong>"). The blizzard starts <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> hours before the encounter is triggered and ends <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> hours after it is resolved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Random Wilderness Encounters table is structured so that certain monsters are more likely to be encountered in a blizzard than others. For example, at the two extremes, yetis are always encountered in a blizzard, whereas perytons almost never are.</p>
<p>Some the random encounters are designed to test the characters in battle, while others encourage roleplaying. All of them paint a picture of Icewind Dale as a harsh realm full of a wide variety of creatures struggling to survive. An encounter&rsquo;s difficultyâ€”noted as Easy, Medium, Hard, or Deadly in the Difficulty column of the Random Wilderness Encounters tableâ€”assumes the characters are 4th, 5th, or 6th level. It&rsquo;s okay for some encounters to be easy and others to be hard or deadly. Easy encounters build players' confidence; hard and deadly encounters force players to weigh their characters' options and think outside the box. If the characters find themselves in a tough spot, give the players time to try to find a way out of it, encourage them to be creative, and award inspiration when appropriate.</p>

The dragon has a healthy respect for humanoids and has never threatened Ten-Towns directly, though it wouldn&rsquo;t take much to provoke her into doing so.</p>
<p>At one time, Arveiaturace served a wizard named Meltharond, whose frozen corpse remains strapped to a saddle on the dragon&rsquo;s back. Arveiaturace has never acknowledged his death and still speaks to his body as if he were alive. He was, while he lived, her only friend and confidant.</p>

Her rider is visible above the surface, looking like a frozen, desiccated corpse sitting in the snow. If the characters are close enough to touch the corpse, they&rsquo;re already on the dragon&rsquo;s back. If they attack or otherwise disturb Meltharond&rsquo;s corpse, the dragon tries to shake them off. Each creature on the dragon&rsquo;s back when she rises out of the snow must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or fall <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of her. The blizzard&rsquo;s wind keeps her from flying, so the characters' best hope of survival is to run away and lose themselves in the storm.</p>
<p>If this encounter doesn&rsquo;t occur during a blizzard, the characters see Arveiaturace in the sky or on the ground. If she&rsquo;s on the ground, she&rsquo;s eating a polar bear or a herd of reindeer that she has killed with her breath weapon. If this encounter occurs on the Sea of Moving Ice, the characters see the dragon erupt from the water nearby with a dead walrus in her mouth; then she flies back to the Reghed Glacier to devour her meal. As long as the characters keep their distance, the White Wyrm ignores them.</p>

It can be neutral or evil, at your discretion. An awakened beast&rsquo;s task is to spy on the characters and ascertain where they might be headed, then report back to its masterâ€”the frost druid who awakened it. This druid might be nearby or many miles away (your choice). For more information about frost druids, see appendix C.</p>
<p>The awakened beast that the characters encounter is smart enough to stay out of harm&rsquo;s way. If the beast is a dangerous predator such as a bear, tiger, or wolf, it keeps its distance from the adventuring party so as not to provoke the characters into attacking it. If it is harmed, the awakened beast retreats to a safe distance. If it&rsquo;s cornered and doesn&rsquo;t like its chances of survival, it bargains or pleads for its life. An awakened beast knows its territory well and can point characters to nearby locations of interest, food sources, or safe places to rest in exchange for its safety.</p>
<p>An awakened beast can be persuaded to help the characters, and perhaps even join the party for a time. Convincing a neutral awakened beast to travel with the party requires an offering of food or shelter accompanied by a successful DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) group check. If the group check succeeds, the beast remains with the party for 24 hours, after which the characters can repeat the group check to extend the duration another 24 hours. An evil awakened beast accepts any offer to join the party (no check required), hoping to gather more information about the characters or lead them into a trap.</p>
<p>If asked to give its name, the awakened beast either comes up with a name on the fly or adopts a suggested name that it likes. If you&rsquo;re having trouble coming up with a voice for the awakened beast, try mimicking the speech of a cartoon character or a famous actor.</p>

The dwarves also have backpacks to hold their bedrolls, mess kits, and rations. They carry fishing tackle or miner&rsquo;s picks, as appropriate.

A character can shift the dwarves' attitude to friendly by speaking to them in Dwarvish. Although the dwarves are grim, which is understandable given the inclement weather, they&rsquo;re neither violent nor spoiling for a fight.</p>
<p>If a stat block becomes necessary, the dwarves are lawful good Battlehammer Dwarf, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dwarf Traits: They have a walking speed of 25 feet and <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet. They speak Common and Dwarvish. They have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage.</li>
<li>They wield handaxes and light crossbows instead of shortswords and longbows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some dwarf names, in case you need them: Bevris, Bolhild, Darrak, Dworic, Fallthra, Gardain, Harbek, Holst, Jarana, Kalanor, Morgrail, Nora, Nordak, Olunt, and Ulf.</p>

Obsession with chardalyn has made these humans psychotic. They go wherever Auril&rsquo;s cruel winds guide them, crave violence, and fight to the bitter end.</p>
<p>The berserkers retain vestiges of their former lives, including the thick clothing they wore as Reghed nomads, but their garments are torn and in need of repair.</p>

The characters notice this ring if they search the dead berserker for treasure. Inscribed on it is a tiny, six-pointed snowflakeâ€”the Frostmaiden&rsquo;s symbol. If the ring is taken from the dead berserker, the ring disappears and all creatures within 100 feet of it are engulfed in swirling snow and teleported to the icy path that leads to the Cave of the Berserkers (see &ldquo;<strong>area Cave of the Berserkers</strong>").

They adapt quickly to almost any natural setting and occasionally offer supernatural gifts to those they glom onto. But a blizzard can drive a chwinga insane, causing it to behave unpredictably until the blizzard passes.</p>
<p>The characters encounter a chwinga (see appendix C) that makes its presence known by springing out of a snowdrift or appearing from behind a frozen bush. It looks like a spindly, snow-white doll wearing a decorative mask. In its tiny hands it holds a frozen berry, which it offers to the characters.</p>

If the chwinga is insane, the frozen berry is bitter, and a character who eats it takes 1 poison damage and must succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> for the next hour.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t the characters' first random encounter with a chwinga in Icewind Dale, you can substitute another gift for the frozen berry, such as a handful of snowflakes that won&rsquo;t melt for 24 hours or a beautifully carved icicle that melts like normal ice. If the chwinga is mad, it might blow the snowflakes into a character&rsquo;s eyes to cause temporary blindness or stab a character with the icicle for 1 piercing damage.</p>
<p>After imparting its gift, a sane chwinga behaves as described in appendix C. An insane chwinga disappears into the snow, then follows the characters and tries to steal little objects weighing 1 pound or less from them. (Stolen items are then hidden in the snow and probably lost.) Whenever it tries to steal something from a character, a chwinga must make a Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Sleight of Hand</wc-fetch>) check. If the check result exceeds the character&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score, the chwinga snatches the item and disappears without the theft being noticed. On a failed check, the character catches the chwinga in the act, foiling the theft, whereupon the chwinga tries to hide or flee. If it escapes, it keeps coming back to hurl tiny snowballs at the character who thwarted it.</p>

<p>If this encounter takes place during a blizzard, the characters experience the added terror of the Frostmaiden&rsquo;s whisper on the wind, telling them, &ldquo;This is the doom that awaits you all. This is the fate of any who dare to claim what is mine. Behold the final light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If one or two crag cats are encountered, they stalk the characters but keep their distance, hoping to pick off individuals who becomes separated from the rest of the party. These crag cats aren&rsquo;t brave or foolish enough to attack a group that outnumbers them.</p>

If the characters hide in the snow and keep their distance, the giant and its mount continue unimpeded, and the encounter ends without bloodshed.</p>
<p>Characters who confront the giant and the mammoth are in for the fight of their lives, for the evil giant is happy to claim their heads as trophies as well as their treasures. In addition to its greataxe, the giant carries a large net that it uses to catch walruses and seals, as well as an enormous lance made from a sharpened mast that it uses to spear creatures while it is mounted. This lance deals 25 (<wc-roll>3d12 + 6</wc-roll>) piercing damage in the giant&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>A character who speaks Giant can use an action to try to change the frost giant&rsquo;s attitude from hostile to indifferent, either by offering it treasure worth at least 1,000 gp or by convincing it that the party is on a quest that would benefit frost giants in some way. For example, the frost giant considers Arveiaturace (see &ldquo;<strong>area Arveiaturace</strong>") a natural enemy and might spare adventurers who claim to be hunting the great white dragon. The giant might also allow characters to pass unmolested if they claim to be on a quest for the spirits of Jarlmoot (see &ldquo;<strong>area Jarlmoot</strong>"). Changing the giant&rsquo;s attitude in this way requires a successful DC 17 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check in addition to a sufficient bribe or a convincing story. If the check fails, subsequent checks made by the characters to change its attitude have disadvantage.</p>

<p>These gnolls come from the Cackling Chasm (see &ldquo;<strong>area Cackling Chasm</strong>"), which provides them with shelter. Gnolls that are captured can lead the characters back to their lair, where they hope to gang up on the characters after luring them there.</p>

<p>The goliaths might be involved in a quest, a scavenger hunt, or an elaborate dare. They might also be looking for Oyaminartok (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Goliaths</strong>&rdquo; entry in <strong>area appendix C</strong>) or searching for a friend who got separated from them in a blizzard. They won&rsquo;t attack characters out of hand, but Wyrmdoom goliaths might challenge one or more characters to an athletic contest. If the characters accept this challenge, roll on the Athletic Contests table to determine what game the goliaths propose. The goliaths are mostly interested in bragging rights, but they&rsquo;re open to other possible rewards.

If the characters insist on repaying its kindness, the werebear urges them to seek out and destroy the Chardalyn Berserker in their lair (see &ldquo;<strong>area Cave of the Berserkers</strong>"). The werebear understands how chardalyn can become corrupted by demonic magic and sees the berserkers as irredeemable victims of this corruption.

They must also contend with monstrous threats unique to this realm.</p>
<p>If this encounter takes place in the tundra, the characters come across a scouting party of <wc-roll>1d6 + 4</wc-roll> Reghed nomads (Tribal Warrior of the Bear, Elk, Tiger, or Wolf tribe) or a similarly sized group of trappers and furriers (Scout) out of Ten-Towns. If the characters are on the Sea of Moving Ice, they encounter a party of <wc-roll>1d6 + 4</wc-roll> hunters (Tribal Warrior) on an ice floe or in canoes, hunting seals, walruses, or whales.</p>
<p>If you need impromptu names for these NPCs, pull from the following list: Affra, Alif, Amina, Brynjar, Chen, Eremon, Hekili, Hishi, Iona, Kamakani, Koamalu, Ling, Margrath, Marrak, Nawra, Noboru, Omolara, Otilia, Quan, Saladin, Shatha, Sigurd, Stalvin, Udo, and Yngvild.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Perytons swoop down from the mountains to hunt. If you catch sight of one, hide under the snow and hope it didn&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you eat the heart of an ice troll, you&rsquo;ll gain the troll&rsquo;s power for a day. But you must eat the whole heart.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Wanna know the safest way to explore the Sea of Moving Ice? Visit Angajuk&rsquo;s Bell on the coast and catch the ride of a lifetime!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you see a cloaked elf with charcoal-colored skin, purple eyes, and a pair of gleaming scimitars, for the love of Sune, don&rsquo;t attack &lsquo;im!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Hunters, though territorial, tend to be indifferent toward strangers. They trade with folk from the mainland on occasion but prefer to be left alone otherwise.</p>
<p>If the characters encounter Reghed nomads, determine which tribe the nomads belong to and their initial attitude toward the characters by rolling on the Reghed Tribes table. You can make a hostile encounter with Reghed nomads tougher by adding more powerful tribe members to the group (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Reghed Nomads</strong>&rdquo; section in appendix C).</p>
<p>Characters with the Outlander background have advantage on ability checks to improve the attitudes of hunters or Reghed nomads. Before any such check can be made, however, a character must give the hunters or nomads something of use (provisions or pipeweed, for example) or honor them or their chieftain with a gift.</p>
<p>If the characters change the attitude of a group of Reghed nomads from indifferent to friendly, the nomads invite the party to their nearest campsite (see &ldquo;<strong>area Reghed Tribe Camp</strong>"), where the nomads provide food, drink, and shelter.</p>

Otherwise, the kobolds are trudging through the snow, bundled in shoddy cloaks made from stitched-together weasel pelts and using their javelins to help them negotiate the frozen ground ahead of them.</p>

At various times in recent history, the great chieftains of this tribe have grown powerful enough to unite the orcs under the Many-Arrows banner. Some of these leaders have led the orcs through times of great peace, while others have used their power to conquer and destroy in the name of Gruumsh, the orc god of slaughter.</p>
<p>This encounter is with an orc war chief, who leads a hunting party that includes an orc eye of Gruumsh, six Orc, and a Half-Ogre (Ogrillon). Painted in dry blood on the eye of Gruumsh&rsquo;s shield is the symbol of the Many-Arrows tribe: a crude skull impaled by three arrows.</p>

Given the scarcity of food sources, they regard wayward travelers as fair game. Those they kill or capture are hauled back to the mountains as meat to feed the tribe.</p>
<p>Despite their hunger and desperation, these orcs can be reasoned with. Their initial attitude toward the characters is hostile, but any character can try to come to terms with them by offering the orcs something they can&rsquo;t get by simply killing the characters and taking their stuff. This includes, but isn&rsquo;t limited to, a song written to honor the chieftain of the Many-Arrows tribe, a drawing of Gruumsh (the orc god of slaughter) killing Corellon (the head of the elven pantheon), or directions to an alternative food source. Characters who speak Orc while conducting the negotiation have advantage on ability checks made to improve the orcs&rsquo; attitude toward the party, as does a character with the Orc Stone secret who uses the stone to summon an orc spirit. Characters who speak Elvish or Dwarvish during the negotiation have disadvantage on such checks. If a worthy offering is made as part of the negotiation, the DC of ability checks made to improve the orcs' attitude is 15; otherwise, the DC is 20.</p>

<p>As an action, a peryton can rip out the heart of a dead humanoid within 5 feet of it. Once they obtain such a prize, the perytons disengage from battle and return to their nest. The perytons won&rsquo;t break off their attack until they get a heart.</p>

If the characters toss food at it, the owlbear eats that food before chasing after more elusive prey.</p>
<p>If a character coaxes the owlbear into becoming the party mascot, you can tax the characters in gold to keep their pet fed and happy. The cost of feeding the owlbear is 9 gp per day, which is based on it eating the equivalent of three pigs (the Player&rsquo;s Handbook values a pig at 3 gp).</p>

Map 2.1 notes their locations, although you can move them elsewhere to suit the needs of your campaign. Although characters can stumble upon a location accidentally while traveling overland, they are more likely to be guided to a location by a tall tale (see the <strong>area Tall Tales in Ten-Towns table</strong>) or a quest.</p>
<p>The adventure locations that follow are balanced for characters of at least 4th level. Lower-level characters can survive the encounters in these locations if they&rsquo;re cautious and manage their resources well, although they should be prepared to flee or hide when they find themselves out of their depth. Characters of 6th level or higher will face few real challenges, but you can soften them up and deplete their resources by staging random encounters as they travel to and from a given location.</p>

Most sperm whales live to be seventy years old, but Angajuk has been plying the waters of the Sea of Moving Ice for two hundred years. Throughout its life, the whale has faced its share of trouble, including near-fatal encounters with Auril&rsquo;s roc, which left scars along the whale&rsquo;s pectoral fins and body.</p>
<p>Angajuk is famous among Ten-Towners. Most people leave it alone, knowing that the whale is the beneficiary of powerful magic, but uncaring hunters see the whale as a source of ambergris, which is a valuable commodity.</p>
<p>Angajuk was once the companion of a druid named Anga, who cast an <wc-fetch type=spell>awaken</wc-fetch> spell on Angajuk to give the whale sentience and intelligence. Not much is known about Anga, but those who befriend Angajuk can learn about its beloved companion.</p>
<p>Characters might learn about Angajuk by overhearing a rumor in Ten-Towns (see &ldquo;<strong>area Tall Tales in Ten-Towns</strong>") or by agreeing to help a whale oil merchant (see &ldquo;<strong>area Whale Oil Acquisition</strong>"). Angajuk is one of the safest ways to get to Auril&rsquo;s island, because the sperm whale can travel beneath the water&rsquo;s surface, avoiding Auril&rsquo;s spies. When the whale is submerged, a magic bubble surrounds the boat to protect those riding in it.</p>
<p>Angajuk periodically visits an anchorage off the coastline, a rocky arch formed by the action of tidal waters, and can be summoned there by ringing a bell attached to the pier. Thick ice covers this rock formation, extending all the way to the shore. On the shore nearby is Anga&rsquo;s old stone cabin, which has weathered time&rsquo;s passage.</p>

Frozen Pier</h5><p>A rowboat is stuck in the ice, trapped against a 10-foot-long wooden pier. The pier is ice-glazed and slippery. The characters don&rsquo;t need the boat, since they can simply walk across the ice to reach Angajuk&rsquo;s Bell (<strong>area area A3</strong>).</p>
<h5 id=a2-stone-cabin>
<a href=#a2-stone-cabin class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>A2. Stone Cabin</h5><p>A small, domed cabin faces the bay. A bloated door covered in ice and dormant barnacles hangs slightly ajar on rusted hinges.</p>
<p>Anga once lived in this small stone cabin near the pier, which made it convenient for her to visit Angajuk. The place has been vacant for decades.</p>
<p>Thick rime coats every surface and object inside the cabin, including a bed draped in a thick knit blanket. Beside the bed, a small hearth holds a precious store of firewood. The firewood is infested with worms that have eaten away at the tender parts of the wood, but it&rsquo;s safe to burn. There is enough wood to fuel a nightly fire for three days, and it is stored in six bundles that weigh 30 pounds each.</p>
<h5 id=a3-bell>

Bell</h5><p>A 1-foot-diameter copper bell dangles from a 10-foot-tall wooden pole attached to this short wooden pier. The bell comes with a rope and clapper. Ringing the bell soon attracts three Giant Vulture, who think that the sound signals mealtime or the presence of prey. They attack unless the characters offer meat to satisfy them.</p>

Angajuk has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common. Its deep, resonant voice carries a slight echo. Once the whale appears, characters must persuade it to be of service (see &ldquo;<strong>area Earning Angajuk&rsquo;s Trust</strong>&rdquo; below). Otherwise, it submerges and departs after a few minutes. If the whale is befriended and the characters communicate their desired destination to it, Angajuk takes them where they want to go provided the location is on or in the Sea of Moving Ice. The awakened whale knows the location of the Frostmaiden&rsquo;s island and, despite some close encounters with Auril&rsquo;s roc, is willing to travel there.</p>
<p>Angajuk&rsquo;s boat can hold up to eight Medium creatures and their gear, and up to 1,000 pounds of cargo.</p>

As the whale submerges, a bubble appears around the boat, enabling its passengers to breathe comfortably underwater. Creatures in the boat can exit the bubble whenever they want, but nothing can pass through the bubble from outside it. The bubble is magical but can&rsquo;t be dispelled.</p>

Hole in the Ice</h5><p>When summoned, Angajuk surfaces through this hole in the ice, expels a gush of seawater from its blowhole, and settles itself at a height that enables people to climb up and into the boat attached to its back.</p>

Characters must earn Angajuk&rsquo;s trust and can do so in any of the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Offering an Octopus</strong>. Angajuk says it would be happy to provide transportation if the characters catch an octopus for it to eat. Octopi can be caught by fishing off the pier, but any hint of light deters them. Use the fishing rules ("<strong>area Fishing for Knucklehead Trout</strong>"), only replace the knucklehead trout with an octopus.</p>

The characters can lure one of these creatures to the surface with an offering of food (such as a fish) and befriend it with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check, which pleases Angajuk.</p>

<p>Hunters from distant Waterdeep have come to the Sea of Moving Ice to harvest ambergris, a precious substance formed in sperm whales' stomachs and typically harvested from a dead whale&rsquo;s remains. Although it smells foul when initially exposed to air, the scent grows sweet over time. As such, ambergris is popular among perfumers as well as mages who use the greasy substance in various arcane rituals. The raw form of ambergris is a waxy lump approximately 2 feet long.</p>

The hunters arrive shortly after the characters but before the whale&rsquo;s arrival. They wear cold weather clothing and have brought four casks of oil with them. They intend to pour the oil through the hole in the ice, contaminating the water around Angajuk&rsquo;s Bell and poisoning the creatures in it.</p>
<p>The leader of the hunters, an older gray-haired man named Jendren Uruth, tries to recruit the characters, offering each of them an equal share of &ldquo;the take.&rdquo; Jendren is not an honest man, but his fight is against Angajuk, not a well-armed party of adventurers. If the characters stand between him and his prey, however, Jendren tries to intimidate them into leaving Angajuk&rsquo;s Bell. Scaring him off requires a successful DC 17 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) group check, since he&rsquo;s dead set on getting his ambergris. If the party&rsquo;s group check succeeds, Jendren and his fellow hunters withdraw, only to return 24 hours later.</p>
<p>If the characters fail to keep the hunters from executing their plan, the oil poisons and muddies the water for 4 days. After a day of contamination, several dead knucklehead trout float to the surface. However, much to the hunters' dismay, the sperm whale avoids the area even after the bell is rung. (For as long as the water is poisoned, Angajuk realizes this and cannot be summoned.) While waiting for the whale, the hunters camp out on the pier or in Anga&rsquo;s cabin. After three more days, they conclude that the poison didn&rsquo;t work and that the whale needs to be lured to the surface with bait. The desperate hunters try to capture a character to use for this purpose and, if successful, bind and lower the character into the water as a lure. Angajuk rises just long enough to fling the lure out of the water, sending the character sprawling across the ice, before submerging and leaving the area, denying the hunters their prize.</p>
<p>Jendren&rsquo;s death breaks the morale of the other hunters, who head back to Bremen in defeat.</p>

When he moved on, the lodge became a refuge for others seeking sanctuary from the wind sweeping down from the Reghed Glacier.</p>
<p>Six months ago, Macreadus, a sage and devout follower of Lathander (god of the dawn and rebirth), formed a plan to end Auril&rsquo;s everlasting winter. He holed up in the Black Cabin, where he spent all his time assembling a weather-controlling magical device called the <em>Summer Star}, using knowledge he gleaned from a book about Netherese artifacts. Macreadus&rsquo;s device was similar in design to a <em>mythallar</em> (see appendix D</em>), but much smaller. Unfortunately for him, it had a serious design flaw. When Macreadus tried to use it three days ago, it malfunctioned, incinerating both him and his book. Characters who search the cabin can find the sage&rsquo;s charred skeleton and his deadly creation.</p>
<p>Since the mishap, Macreadus&rsquo;s restless spirit has lingered in the Border Ethereal, unwilling to depart until its work is complete. (For more information on the Border Ethereal, see the &ldquo;Ethereal Plane&rdquo; section in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.)</p>

Characters can see the restless spirit of Macreadus and interact with it only if they cross over to the Border Ethereal, which is what happens to someone who dies in the cabin (see &ldquo;Dying in the Black Cabin&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>In the Border Ethereal, the spirit of Macreadus manifests as a giant, floating, spectral head with fire burning in its eyes. Arrogant in life, Macreadus remains so in death. He&rsquo;s snappy and egotistical, blaming everything but himself for his failure. He welcomes the company of others, but anyone who questions his motives or mocks his invention quickly loses his favor. He spent months locked away in the cabin, building the <em>Summer Star</em> so he could end the Everlasting Rime, becoming more and more desperate to see it through. He had hoped to make a name for himself and win Lathander&rsquo;s praiseâ€”is that so wrong?</p>
<p>If the characters try to finish his work, Macreadus helps as much as his bodiless form allows. To lay his spirit to rest, the characters must fix his creation&rsquo;s design flaw and then activate it, all within the confines of the Black Cabin, where Macreadus can observe the results. Once he sees the device working as intended, his spirit departs to the afterlife.</p>

This is what happened to Macreadus, and the same fate awaits characters who perish in the cabin.</p>
<p>If a character dies in the cabin and its spirit manifests in the Border Ethereal, the player can choose the form the spirit takes. It might look like a spectral image of the dead character, or it might be something bizarre like a ghostly crow or a blob of ectoplasmic energy.</p>
<p>Regardless of the form it takes, the spirit is not a creature and can&rsquo;t be harmed or turned. It can&rsquo;t make attack rolls and doesn&rsquo;t make saving throws, and conditions don&rsquo;t apply to it. It can&rsquo;t cast spells or attune to magic items. Creatures on the Material Plane can&rsquo;t see the spirit without some ability or magic that lets them gaze into the Border Ethereal. A spirit in the Border Ethereal can&rsquo;t speak to creatures on the Material Plane, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The spirit can do the following and nothing else:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spirit can move through the Border Ethereal. It has a flying speed of 30 feet, and it can hover. It can pass through solid surfaces that are visible on the Material Plane to explore closed-off parts of the cabin; it is bound to the cabin, however, and can&rsquo;t move more than 30 feet away from it.</li>
<li>The spirit can make ability checks based on Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma only. It applies no modifiers to these checks.</li>
<li>As an action, the spirit can attempt to exert up to 5 pounds of force on a creature or object no more than 5 feet away from it in the Material Plane, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma check. The spirit might use this ability to move a tiny object, write a message on a frosty or sooty surface, operate a simple tool, or tap someone on the shoulder, but the force isn&rsquo;t strong enough to cause harm to a creature.</li>
<li>The spirit can see other spirits in the Border Ethereal (including the spirit of Macreadus) and speak to them. The spirit knows the languages it knew in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perched on the edge of a snowy ridge above a gorge is a black lodge on wooden stilts. Whatever path might have led to this ramshackle retreat lies buried under snow.</p>
<p>Icy steps climb to a snow-covered walkway that clings to the south side of the structure. The building&rsquo;s slumped posture and sagging, snow-covered roof, coupled with the broken windows and loose, flapping shutters, suggest utter abandonment. Large snowdrifts huddle around the rotting stilts and engulf a nearby woodshed and outhouse. Only the wind visits this sinister place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Black Cabin has two stone chimneys that rise several feet above its sagging roofline. The rest of the lodge is made of rotting wood. The stilts that elevate the structure are 20 feet tall, and characters who walk underneath the old building can tell that its wooden floors are in poor condition, perhaps even in danger of collapse in one location (see <strong>area area B4</strong>).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear to anyone surveying the Black Cabin that part of the ridge it rests on fell away some time ago, leaving the westernmost section of the building hanging over the gorge. All of the cabin&rsquo;s doors are closed and unlocked, and its windows are big enough for characters to climb through.</p>

The Summer Star has lost its luster but not its magic. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals a weak, residual aura of transmutation magic surrounding it.</p>
<p>The first time a creature picks up the <em>Summer Star</em>, its core glows with a golden radiance as bright as a candle flame. Unless the creature drops the device immediately, the light suddenly blossoms, becoming a 10-foot-radius sphere of incinerating golden radiance centered on the device. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 90 (<wc-roll>10d10 + 35</wc-roll>) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this effect reduces a creature to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, the creature is turned to ashes if the remaining damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum. Once the explosion is triggered, the <em>Summer Star</em> becomes inoperable and safe to handle.</p>
<p>A character killed by the <em>Summer Star</em> becomes an ethereal spirit bound to the Black Cabin (see &ldquo;<strong>area Dying in the Black Cabin</strong>"). Don&rsquo;t fret if this happens to one or more characters; as spirits, they can figure out a way back to the realm of the living.</p>
<p>Once the <em>Summer Star</em> discharges its residual magic, the charactersâ€”both the material and the ethereal onesâ€”can safely analyze and fix the device so that it functions as Macreadus intended. The steps to be followed are summarized below:</p>
<h6 id=step-1-identify-the-item>
<a href=#step-1-identify-the-item class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Step 1: Identify the Item</h6><p>Any creature or spirit that studies the runes on the device&rsquo;s rings and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check ascertains that the device was designed to control the weather. An <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell reveals the same, and Macreadus&rsquo;s spirit can freely divulge this information to other spirits. A character who has Macreadus&rsquo;s blueprints from the laboratory (<strong>area area B6</strong>) can use them to gain advantage on the check.</p>
<h6 id=step-2-analyze-the-problem>
<a href=#step-2-analyze-the-problem class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Step 2: Analyze the Problem</h6><p>The device has a design flaw, obviously. Macreadus has concluded that the device&rsquo;s rings are unable to contain the magical energy that the core puts out. A third ring must be attached to the device, and this new ring must have runes like those that appear on the other two rings. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check comes to this conclusion. The check is made with advantage if the character witnessed the device malfunction.</p>
<h6 id=step-3-fix-the-design-flaw>
<a href=#step-3-fix-the-design-flaw class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Step 3: Fix the Design Flaw</h6><p>To craft a third ring, a quarter-pound of metal must be melted down in a fire and recast using smith&rsquo;s tools, then inscribed with runes by someone with a steady handâ€”that is, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check. Using tinker&rsquo;s tools provides advantage on the check. Finally, the device must be modified to accommodate the third ring, using either smith&rsquo;s tools or tinker&rsquo;s tools. The modification process can be completed in a few hours.</p>
<h6 id=step-4-activate-the-item>
<a href=#step-4-activate-the-item class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Step 4: Activate the Item</h6><p>A character must attune to the modified Summer Star to use it. While holding the device, the attuned character can use an action to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>control weather</wc-fetch> spell from it, without the need for the character or the Summer Star to be outdoors. After the spell is cast, the Summer Star ceases to be magical. The spell lasts for the duration or until the character&rsquo;s concentration ends.</p>
<p>Macreadus knows what must be done to fix the device but can&rsquo;t activate the item because he&rsquo;s dead. If no one can attune to the modified <em>Summer Star</em> because everyone in the party is dead and trapped as a spirit in the Border Ethereal, nothing more can be done with the device until someone else comes along who can attune to it. Fortunately for the characters, they don&rsquo;t have long to wait before someone arrives (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Werebear Visitor</strong>&rdquo; sidebar). Characters in spirit form can convince the new arrival to do what they cannot, perhaps by writing messages in the snow, or on a section of wall or floor using ash from a nearby fireplace.</p>
<p>Macreadus&rsquo;s spirit can finally rest after it witnesses the activation of the new and improved <em>Summer Star</em>. As it departs, the party receives a special blessing from Lathander. Any party member who died within the past 24 hours is instantly restored to life at full health, regardless of how the character died. In addition, each character who helped lay Macreadus&rsquo;s spirit to rest gains a <em>blessing of the Morninglord</em> (described below). For rules on blessings, see &ldquo;Supernatural Gifts&rdquo; in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Blessing of the Morninglord:</strong> You gain 10 temporary hit points each day at dawn.</p>

Any creature standing on the floor when it collapses must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls to the bottom of the gorge directly below this section of the cabin, taking 49 (<wc-roll>14d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage and landing <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>. On a successful save, the creature grabs hold of the edge of the remaining floor and is hanging from it. The creature can use an action to try to pull itself up, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check, while another creature within reach can use the <wc-fetch type=action>Help</wc-fetch> action to assist. A hanging creature can repeat the check until it succeeds, but if a check fails by 5 or more, the creature lets go and falls.</p>

Sweetberry Summer Wine</h5><blockquote>
<p>The scent of wine fills this room, which contains four frost-covered barrels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Macreadus was a heavy drinker, and the barrels contain his supply of Sweetberry Summer Wine. Any character proficient with brewer&rsquo;s supplies knows that this wine comes from a vineyard in the Dessarin Valley, hundreds of miles to the south. The extreme cold has caused the wine to freeze.</p>
<p>Despite its inability to partake of the libations, the spirit of Macreadus reacts poorly toward characters who thaw and drink this private stash.</p>

<p>This room contains a fireplace and two empty bookcases. Tacked to the walls and strewn across the floor are frost-covered blueprints. Facedown on the floor next to one of the blueprints is a tiny man made of clay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who examines the clay figure and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check ascertains that it is a dead homunculus. This was Macreadus&rsquo;s magical assistant, Blare. It died when its master died.</p>
<p>Any character proficient in <wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> can study the blueprints and conclude that they show different experimental designs for a weather-controlling magic device. One of these designs resembles a gyroscope and closely resembles the object found in <strong>area area B4</strong>.</p>

Maybe without me here to incessantly complain to, you&rsquo;ll finally snap out of your obsession.</p>
<p>If you truly insist on dedicating your remaining days to this doomed project, might I suggest that three is better than two. I considered telling you before, but you were particularly rude about the dinner I made last night.</p>

She responds by sending a coldlight walker (see appendix C) and three Ice Mephit to kill the characters and anyone else at the Black Cabin. If the party is 6th level or higher, add another coldlight walker to the attacking force. If the characters have a goliath werebear on their side, add a third coldlight walker and two more ice mephits.</p>

<p>The coldlight walkers are made from the frozen corpses of Ten-Towners who were banished to the tundra as sacrifices to the Frostmaiden (see &ldquo;<strong>area Sacrifices to Auril</strong>"). The ice mephits descend from the darkened sky to provide aerial support, using their <wc-fetch type=spell>fog cloud</wc-fetch> spells to engulf enemy spellcasters or to obscure the approaching coldlight walkers.

The fang of Yeenoghu, Chyzka, is being blamed for the pack&rsquo;s recent misfortunes. It led the gnolls to Icewind Dale, promising abundant food. What the gnolls got instead was an unending winter and barely enough nourishment to sustain them. The gnolls are forced to resort to cannibalism to survive when food is scarce, and the pack has no hyenas to replenish its dwindling numbers. Because Chyzka lacks the ability to sustain the pack and create more gnolls, its usefulness has come to an end.</p>
<p>The other gnolls are too afraid of Chyzka to challenge it directly (it is, after all, one of Yeenoghu&rsquo;s chosen). The gnolls are, however, willing to stand idly by while the characters take care of Chyzka for them. Once the fang of Yeenoghu is dead, the gnolls will allow Chyzka&rsquo;s slayers to leave the chasm unmolested while they dine on Chyzka&rsquo;s remains. The characters' actions give them a window of time to take what they want and flee the chasm before the remaining gnolls turn against them.</p>

<p>A yawning chasm ahead of you threatens to devour you as if it were a giant, icy maw. The wind sweeping through the mountains can&rsquo;t drown out the inhuman cackling that echoes in the chasm&rsquo;s depths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who look over the edge of the icy chasm can see stony projections resembling teeth, as well as a ledge 30 feet down. (A wider ledge 100 feet down is probably initially beyond the range of the characters' light sources and <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch>.)</p>
<p>A search of the surrounding area reveals a cave mouth near the south end of the chasm (area Z1). Within the cave mouth are steps leading down to <strong>area area Z2</strong>, which leads to the uppermost ledge of the chasm. Alternatively, characters can use magic or climbing gear to lower themselves down into the chasm.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The gnolls gather here to eat when there&rsquo;s food to be had.</p>
<p>Most of the bones have been broken to enable the gnolls to get to the marrow inside them. Past feasts include elk, reindeer, moose, foxes, wolves, and humanoids. Some of the bones belong to gnolls who fell prey to cannibalism.</p>
<p>The four Gnoll in area Z3 move here to investigate any loud noises. They don&rsquo;t attack intruders right away, however, except in self-defense (see &ldquo;<strong>area Tale of Gnoll Betrayal</strong>").</p>

<p>Unless they were drawn to area Z2, four Gnoll are crouched before the altar, weighing the ramifications of licking the flesh off the goat&rsquo;s skull, which is meant to be an offering to the demon lord Yeenoghu.

<p>Thirty feet below the surface, a shelf of rock surrounds the chasm&rsquo;s gaping maw, its cracked sides riddled with caves and festooned with sharp rocks. Farther down in the chasm, you see dead gnolls impaled on some of these fang-like protrusions.</p>
<p>Manic laughter echoes through the chasm as you look around, the sound ricocheting off the walls that make its origin impossible to pinpoint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chyzka, the Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu, encourages internal fighting whenever it senses the pack might turn against it. The dead gnolls seen throughout the chasm were victims of either these squabbles or their own carelessness. Although the ledge that allows access to the various caves is slick with ice, cautious characters can move on it without falling.</p>
<p>Every loud noise in the chasm can be heard in the surrounding caves, and vice versa. Characters who make enough noise to attract the attention of the gnolls can hear them coming by their manic laughter. The Cackling Chasm Roster provides a summary of these denizens and the areas they originate in. When Chyzka sees intruders, it barks orders to the other gnolls, after which there&rsquo;s an awkward pause as the subordinate gnolls give the characters expectant looks. Any character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check can ascertain that these gnolls have lost faith in their leader and would be delighted to see Chyzka fall.</p>

<p>Painted in blood on the walls of this eight-foot-high cave are pictographs of a towering monster with sharp teeth that wields what looks like a three-headed flail. Packs of hyenas feed on the corpses in its wake. A small fire crackles near the south wall, filling the cave with smoke. Cooking above the fire is a small green fish, while behind the fire, leaning against the south wall, is a blood-encrusted spear and a fishing pole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chyzka, a gnoll fang of Yeenoghu, is resting here unless a disturbance has summoned it elsewhere. The bloody paintings on the wall show the demon lord Yeenoghu and his brood.</p>
<p>The cave is littered with pieces of dirty cloth and moldy hides, all taken from prey. The spear leaning against the south wall is nonmagical but has a silvered tip stained red with blood. Though the spear has its uses, Chyzka prefers to attack with its claws and teeth.</p>

<p>Situated atop the ledge is a cage made of thick timber beams with a bolted iron door and iron fittings. The cage is five feet on a side and seven feet tall. Inside it, a male human in hide armor paces back and forth. His murderous eyes lock onto any sort of movement he notices, and he clutches a javelin made of a black, crystalline substance. The skin on his hands and face is black from frostbite, and his lips are chapped and bleeding from the cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man in the cage is a nameless chardalyn berserker (see appendix C) with 60 hit points remaining. The gnolls captured him almost by accident. He ventured into the chasm a few days ago and brutally attacked any gnoll he encountered. One gnoll climbed atop the cage to get away from him. As the berserker started to climb after it, he was pushed from behind by another gnoll and locked in the cage. The gnolls are keeping him confined until he grows weak enough that they dare to open the cage to kill and eat him. The bolt on the door can&rsquo;t be reached by someone trapped in the cage.</p>
<p>During the skirmish, the berserker lost his chardalyn flail and two chardalyn javelins, all of which fell into the chasm. He still has one javelin left. The berserker tries to grapple any character he can reach through the bars; if he succeeds, he tries to stab the <wc-fetch type=condition>grappled</wc-fetch> character with his javelin on his next turn. If he is released, the berserker attacks the nearest creature without fear or remorse. Efforts to parlay with the berserker are met with hateful silence.</p>

In fact, characters who stay too long run the risk of encountering six Gnoll returning from a hunt. There&rsquo;s a 20 percent chance that the gnolls have brought food with them, such as a dead mountain goat or crag cat, in which case the gnolls gather in <strong>area area Z2</strong> (along with any other gnolls left alive in the chasm) to feast on the fresh kill.</p>
<p>If the characters turn the gnolls' animus toward Chyzka to their advantage, they can come and go without having to kill every gnoll in the chasm. Even so, any gnolls they leave alive remain a potential threat to Ten-Towns.</p>

That effort bore no fruit, and the cave was abandoned. The Tribe of the Bear later used it as a shelter until the chardalyn berserkers forced them to abandon it.</p>
<p>The berserkers worship the Frostmaiden and no longer consider themselves members of the Bear tribe. They allow frostbite to ravage their faces and bodies to prove their devotion. As a reward for their fealty and their willingness to suffer the cold, the Frostmaiden gave these mad servants a stone brazier that emits a cold, blue flame. As long as the flame burns, the berserkers can&rsquo;t be killed inside their lair (see <strong>area area Q5</strong>).</p>
<p>The berserkers share their cave with two white dragon wyrmlings, which hatched from eggs that the berserkers stole from within a glacial rift. The berserkers share their food with the wyrmlings, which guard the cave while the berserkers are out hunting.</p>

<p>Built around the mouth of the cave is a ramshackle wooden portico crudely shaped like a bear&rsquo;s head with its mouth agape. The tunnel beyond it is dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The portico is sturdier than it looks. It has AC 15, 75 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Characters who damage the portico make enough noise to attract the two White Dragon Wyrmling in <strong>area area Q4</strong>. One makes its way through area Q3 to confront intruders head-on while the other descends the chute in area Q4 and attacks from behind.</p>
<p>The wyrmlings don&rsquo;t pursue prey that flees the cave. Instead, they roost atop snowy outcroppings above the entrance and keep watch for several hours before retiring to their lair (area Q4) to rest.</p>

A naturally formed pillar supports the chamber&rsquo;s domed roof.</p>
<p>Two alcoves set into the north wall are fitted with rusty iron gates. Their chains, padlocks, and keys lie discarded on the floor outside them. Inside each cell are fragments of the shell of a bluish-white egg that must&rsquo;ve been as large as a halfling. Any character who examines these eggshells and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>) check concludes that they are white dragon eggs that hatched about three years ago.</p>
<p>Any loud noise here, which could be from the opening of either gate or the rattling of chains, alerts the two White Dragon Wyrmling in area Q4. One confronts intruders head-on while the other descends the chute in area Q4 and swoops in from behind.</p>

<p>If they have not been lured elsewhere, two White Dragon Wyrmling named Gelym and Tyzar curl up together in the eastern part of the cave. They attack any creature that enters their den.</p>
<p>The stone chute is 25 feet long, roughly hewn, and steeply angled. It empties into the ravine outside and requires a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check to ascend or descend without magic or climbing gear; a character who fails this check by 5 or more slips and tumbles into the ravine, landing in soft snow. Gore from the slaughterhouse (area Q6), not to mention human waste, is routinely dumped down the chute, which is stained with blood and filth.</p>

Frostmaiden&rsquo;s Fire</h5><blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of icicles cling to the twelve-foot-high ceiling of this frost-rimed chamber, which is bathed in flickering blue light. The light&rsquo;s source is a blue flame crackling in a stone brazier that stands against the far wall. The white smoke that rises above it coalesces every few seconds into the form of a woman, but the image is fleeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals a powerful aura of abjuration magic around the 3-foot-high stone brazier, which rises naturally from the floor and is therefore not a discrete object. It can&rsquo;t be moved or damaged, and its magical flame can&rsquo;t be smothered or put out with water. Any creature that comes into direct contact with the fire for the first time on a turn takes 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) cold damage.</p>
<p>Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the fire snuffs it out for 1 hour, after which the fire reignites on its own. Using a <wc-fetch type=spell>stone shape</wc-fetch> spell to alter the brazier&rsquo;s shape puts out the fire for good.</p>
<p>As long as the brazier&rsquo;s cold fire burns, chardalyn berserkers inside the cave (areas <strong>area Q3</strong> through <strong>area Q8</strong>, and the tunnels and chutes that attach to them) can&rsquo;t drop below 1 hit point. No other creatures gain this benefit. Characters who fight the berserkers inside their lair see them shake off damage that would normally kill them.</p>
<p>The berserkers are aware of the fire&rsquo;s benefit, as evidenced by the rictus grins that cross their faces when intruders realize the berserkers are seemingly unkillable. The berserkers don&rsquo;t automatically sense when the fire has been put out, however.</p>

<p>As the characters emerge from the cave, they see the berserkers on the causeway.

The berserkers gain no benefit from the Frostmaiden&rsquo;s fire (see <strong>area area Q5</strong>) while they&rsquo;re on the causeway, so they try to get inside the cave, attacking anyone in their way.

<p>The Sea of Moving Ice stretches out before you, a featureless, frozen desert. Ahead, the smooth white surface is interrupted by a towering ship, its exterior covered in frost.</p>

<p>The hull, rigging, and masts of the ship are covered in a layer of ice. From the waterline of the vessel, it&rsquo;s a 10-foot climb to get to the main deck. The sides of the hull are slippery and can&rsquo;t be climbed without using magic or climbing gear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You hear loud thumping and creaking coming from inside the hold, followed by the guttural snarls of some creature. The ship is not as abandoned as it appeared!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ice troll (see appendix C) was chasing a herd of seals when it spotted the abandoned ship and crept across the ice to explore it, hoping to find something tasty inside. It spooked some kobolds in the hold and chased them into a cabin. The kobolds were able to barricade the door, and the troll is trying to break through it to get at them.</p>
<p>Characters can surprise the troll if they remain quiet as they make their way into the ship&rsquo;s hold (area <wc-roll>D9</wc-roll>). Climbing onto the ship and moving through it without alerting the troll requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check. If a character fails this check, the troll hears the character&rsquo;s footsteps or the creaking of the deck and realizes there&rsquo;s an easier meal to be had.</p>

The skeleton wears a jacket and a wide-brimmed hat that hides most of its skull. Under its right arm is a captain&rsquo;s journal. The floor is strewn with empty wine bottles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kobolds have not set foot inside this cabin; in fact, no one has been here since the crew abandoned ship. The corpse is all that remains of Captain Rudolph Bluemoon, who stayed behind to watch over the ship and his ill-gotten booty. He ran out of provisions and starved before freezing to death. Affixed to the captain&rsquo;s hat is a badge that forms a curious symbol: a red eel wrapped around a gold trident. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check recognize this as one of the symbols of Ship Suljack, a powerful faction in Luskan that engages in piracy. Captain Bluemoon was a member of this faction.</p>
<p>In the captain&rsquo;s inside jacket pocket, the characters find a key with its head fashioned in the form of a rat&rsquo;s skull. This key unlocks the captain&rsquo;s chest (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The wine bottles have labels that read &ldquo;Sweetberry Summer Wine.&rdquo; The bottles' corks are not to be seen (though the characters can find them inside the captain&rsquo;s treasure chest).</p>

This is a great opportunity to allow the player of that character to make up a credible story; if the player accepts the challenge, award inspiration to that player&rsquo;s character.

It doesn&rsquo;t represent Arveiaturace&rsquo;s entire hoard, merely the small portion she chose to bring aboard the Dark Duchess. Characters can see the treasure under the topmost layer of ice, and each layer of ice takes 1 hour to get through using a miner&rsquo;s pick or similar tool and twice as long using fire. Chipping or melting away each ice layer frees up the treasure under that layer:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The crew took most of the food from this galley before abandoning ship, and the kobolds found and ate whatever scraps were left behind, sharing their meager findings with the goat, which the kobolds use as a pack animal. The ice troll hasn&rsquo;t yet detected the goat. The kobolds keep it here so the dragon doesn&rsquo;t eat it.</p>

<p>This cabin is empty except for a smashed wooden crate lying on the frost-covered floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone who takes the time to study this detritus notices that some of the planks display parts of a painted symbol. The characters can reassemble the symbol by putting the planks together properly. The image is a circle, contained within which is the smiling face of a drow who wears an eye patch and a purple, wide-brimmed hat accented with a colorful feather plume.

The kobolds have slid a heavy wooden bar across the inside of the door to keep it shut for now. The characters must break down the door to enter the cabin, since the kobolds have no intention of letting them in. The door has AC 15, 5 hit points remaining, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. As an action, a character can shoulder or kick open the door with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The floor of this cabin is icy. Lying on their sides are two empty, open barrels. Hides and furs have been pushed into these barrels to create makeshift sleeping quarters. Two similar but upright barrels appear untouched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four Icewind Kobold (see <strong>area appendix C</strong>) hide behind the barrels and hurl their javelins at the first creature to enter the room. After they throw their javelins, the kobolds are weaponless. They worship Arveiaturace and do the dragon&rsquo;s bidding. They don&rsquo;t know when she&rsquo;ll return next, but she always does.</p>
<p>The upright barrels hold frozen, fresh water. The kobolds turned the empty barrels into sleeping hovels.</p>

<p>The dragon is out hunting when the characters first arrive at the <em>Dark Duchess</em>, but she checks on the ship regularly to make sure her hoard is undisturbed. At the end of each hour the characters spend in the <em>Dark Duchess</em>, there is a 20 percent chance that Arveiaturace returns to the ship. Because she can see only out to a range of 60 feet, the dragon must get close to the ship to examine it.</p>
<p>If the characters are below decks when the White Wyrm arrives, use the following boxed text to describe her arrival:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the howling wind, you hear the flapping of titanic wings followed by the cracking of ice under the weight of something immense. A loud snort accompanies the sound of claws scraping against ice-glazed timbers.</p>
<p>The voice of what could only be a truly immense dragon fills the bowels of the ship. &ldquo;I smell warm flesh and hear the panic of beating hearts. Ready your spells, Meltharond! We have uninvited guests.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one or more characters are topside, use the following boxed text instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A great white dragon descends from the sky, beating its wings furiously to slow its descent. A dark, humanoid figure is mounted on the dragon&rsquo;s back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters hide and don&rsquo;t make a lot of noise, Arveiaturace climbs aboard the vessel from the forecastle and begins to make her way toward the hold. No matter where the characters are on the ship, they hear Arveiaturace board it, as her massive form makes the entire vessel shake and the ice around it crack. If Arveiaturace notices the characters, she immediately says to the rider on her back, &ldquo;We know how to deal with thieves, don&rsquo;t we Meltharond?&rdquo; She then attacks. If she doesn&rsquo;t notice the characters, she makes her way to her hoard, inspects the hold to make sure nothing is out of place, and leaves the ship to find and eat a tasty walrus. If she sees that the hoard has been disturbed, the dragon looks around the ship to see if the thieves left tracks and follows any she finds, calling out to Meltharond to ready his spells. If she suspects that intruders are still aboard the vessel but hiding in places she can&rsquo;t reach, she breaks through walls to get at them.</p>
<p>The characters are no match for the dragon. If they need a distraction to facilitate their escape, Meltharond&rsquo;s corpse could fall out of its saddle. This causes the dragon to break off her attack at once and check to make sure the dead wizard is undamaged. The dragon can&rsquo;t put Meltharond&rsquo;s corpse back in its saddle without help. If there any kobolds are nearby, they can assist; otherwise, Arveiaturace promises to spare the characters' lives if they lend a helping hand. Someone who makes a successful Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check contested by the dragon&rsquo;s Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check discerns that she has no intention of keeping her promise. If the characters simply bolt, Arveiaturace does not pursue them, afraid to leave Meltharond&rsquo;s side. Once the characters are beyond her field of vision, the somewhat dim dragon remembers that she&rsquo;s big enough to scoop up Meltharond with one claw; she does soâ€”gentlyâ€”and flies back to her lair atop the Reghed Glacier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A nine-foot-tall giant in thick walrus hide armor bounds across the ice with surprising speed and grace despite her gangly, misshapen limbs. Although her narrow face is hard to see under the fur-lined hood of her frost-covered cloak, it&rsquo;s clear that the left side of her face sags much lower than the right. As the giant draws near, she skids to a stop, rests her greatclub on one broad shoulder, and says, &ldquo;Need any help?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tinjong avoids the <em>Dark Duchess</em> because she knows the White Wyrm frequents it. If the characters accept her offer, Tinjong uses her <wc-fetch type=spell>fog cloud</wc-fetch> spell to obscure them, then tries to lead everyone beyond Arveiaturace&rsquo;s range of sight, which is 60 feet.</p>
<p>Tinjong worships Silvanus (god of nature) and has no agenda. She tries to be helpful while asking for nothing in return, and she carries nothing of value. Although she has no interest in becoming a permanent member of the party, Tinjong is willing to accompany the characters to Auril&rsquo;s island if their aim is to confront the Frostmaiden and end her everlasting winter, claiming that&rsquo;s what Silvanus would want her to do.</p>

It emerges to greet Tinjong when she returns, however. The chwinga likes music and bestows a supernatural charm (see &ldquo;New Chwinga Charms&rdquo;) upon the first character who spends at least 1 hour playing music for it.</p>

The ship&rsquo;s cocaptains, Vorryn Q&rsquo;uuol and Dredavex Sinfiz, are chaotic neutral gnome ceremorphs, which are smaller-than-normal mind flayers spawned from gnome hosts. Their crew consists of three gnome squidlings named Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd. See the &ldquo;Mind Flayers&rdquo; entry in appendix C for more information about gnome ceremorphs and squidlings.</p>
<p>The illithids are stuck unless they can find a <wc-fetch type=item>psi crystal</wc-fetch>) to jump-start the ship&rsquo;s propulsion system. Vorryn and Dredavex are expending considerable effort to keep their ship functional and thus cannot conduct the search themselves. They also can&rsquo;t trust the moronic squidlings to accomplish such a delicate task. For these reasons, the gnome ceremorphs need help. They have built a device that can detect the presence of <wc-fetch type=item>Psi Crystal</wc-fetch> in a 5-mile radius but haven&rsquo;t found any. The characters might have harvested a <wc-fetch type=item>psi crystal</wc-fetch> from the gem mine near Termalaine (see &ldquo;<strong>area A Beautiful Mine</strong>"), in which case the gnome ceremorphs would be very interested in acquiring it.</p>
<p>Complicating matters is the damage done by the crash to the nautiloid&rsquo;s life support system, for once this system shuts down, the illithids are at risk of freezing to death. If the shutdown occurs before they acquire a <wc-fetch type=item>psi crystal</wc-fetch>, the gnome ceremorphs' back-up plan is to activate the nautiloid&rsquo;s self-destruct system (see <strong>area area N7</strong>) before abandoning ship and making their way toward Ten-Towns with the gnome squidlings in tow.</p>

They retain their gnomish curiosity and love of tinkering, now blended with the illithids' drive for control and experimentation. They are delighted to meet visitors who are willing to help them acquire a <wc-fetch type=item>psi crystal</wc-fetch> or, failing that, help them and the gnome squidlings infiltrate Ten-Towns. In exchange, the Gnome Ceremorph are willing to part with their laser pistols and the magic items in <strong>area area N9</strong>.</p>
<p>If the characters want to search for a <wc-fetch type=item>psi crystal</wc-fetch>, Dredavex gives them a handheld box that emits a clicking noise while a <wc-fetch type=item>psi crystal</wc-fetch> is within 5 miles of it (see <strong>area area N5</strong>). The ceremorphs tell the characters that <wc-fetch type=item>Psi Crystal</wc-fetch> are most often found in places where mind flayers have lived.</p>
<p>Unlike most mind flayers, who prefer to communicate using telepathy, Vorryn and Dredavex prefer to speak aloud in Gnomish or Undercommon, with an accent best described as &ldquo;gooey.&rdquo; Vorryn is persnickety and exasperated most of the time but also has a dry sense of humor. Dredavex is industrious and likes to ease tension by telling crude jokes it has learned from eating goblin brains. If they or any of the gnome squidlings are threatened, the ceremorphs react with deadly intent; otherwise, they shun combat.</p>

Beyond such base hunger, the gnome squidlings don&rsquo;t know what they want. They have the reasoning and emotional control of toddlers blended with the guile of bored housecats.</p>
<p>Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd make squelching and keening noises when excited or upset; otherwise, they communicate in bursts of emotion punctuated with short, simple words conveyed telepathically.

The signal&rsquo;s technology hasn&rsquo;t been perfected yet, such that nontelepathic creatures have been known to pick up the signal as well. You get to decide whether a nontelepathic creature can sense the signal or not.</p>
<p>The psionic transmitter broadcasts on an endless loop until Vorryn or Dredavex decides to shut it off, or until the transmitter is disabled or destroyed (see <strong>area area N7</strong>).</p>
<p>The signal has a range of 50 miles. Those lucky few who can detect it and set out for the source can feel it guiding them toward the downed nautiloid. The signal is a sequence of words in Deep Speech with a buzzing undertone. Any creature that understands Deep Speech and is sensitive to the signal can translate the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nautiloid down. Emergency protocols enabled. Crew safe, but vessel imperiled. Psi crystal needed. Come at once.&rdquo;</p>

Its construction is partly organic, and the tentacles protruding from the ship&rsquo;s bow are coated in mucus that remains sticky even in the extreme cold.</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s interior is a mess. The walls are crusted with patches of flaky plaque, and the floor is splattered with sticky blots of an inky-black substance that courses through the ship&rsquo;s veins.

<p>Two Carrion Crawler, Vorryn&rsquo;s trained pets, scuttle through the snow near the ship. Characters who have passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) scores of 11 or higher are not surprised when the creatures attack.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Biological Construction</b> The ship is built of organic matter in addition to wood and iron. Walls, floors, and ceilings are reinforced with tough chitin.</li>
<li><b>Canted Deck</b> The ship tilts to the south at a slight angleâ€”not enough to hinder movement aboard the vessel, but enough to cause certain objects and liquids on the floor to roll toward the port side of the ship.</li>
<li><b>Ceilings</b> Ceilings are 20 feet high unless otherwise noted.</li>
<li><b>Illumination</b> All areas in the ship are dimly lit by fleshy, flickering, bioluminescent orbs mounted to the walls or hanging from the ceiling.</li>
<li><b>Interior Doors</b> Each interior door aboard the ship is a fleshy sphincter that opens when a creature that has telepathy approaches within 5 feet of it, then quickly closes behind the creature and its companions to keep the heat in. A door must otherwise be pried or tickled open, which requires an action.</li>
<li><b>Life Support</b> The failing life support system is keeping the ship&rsquo;s interior temperature at 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). The system gives out completely 24 hours after the characters arrive (unless they do something about it), at which point the temperature begins falling 10 degrees Fahrenheit per hour until it matches the temperature outside.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Something big is plowing through the deep snow, heading in your direction. Only its shiny dorsal ridge breaks the snow&rsquo;s surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vorryn and Dredavex released a hostile bulette into the wild after the crash because they didn&rsquo;t want to feed it. They have no control over the creature, and they have all but forgotten about it. They fail to warn the characters that it poses a threat to anyone approaching or leaving the ship.</p>
<p>The characters first notice the bulette when it&rsquo;s 120 feet away from them, and it has three-quarters cover under the snow. When it gets within 30 feet of the party, the bulette springs out of the snow and uses its Deadly Leap.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t kill it, the bulette gradually migrates toward Ten-Towns.</p>

<p>Seven empty, ice-glazed thrones form a ring atop a snow-covered hillock. Under the light of a full moon, the apparitions of dead frost giant jarls appear in the thrones, clutching the ends of their armrests with icy fingers as they reminisce about the glorious past.</p>
<p>The ancient thrones are carved out of blocks of stone. When the apparitions of the frost giants manifest, their eyes glow white in the darkness. Three of the giants have on fur vests and leather trousers; three others wear chainmail from head to toe. The seventh giant, Reggaryarva, is slightly larger than the others and wears a coat of white dragon scales and a magnificent horned helm. Reggaryarva was once called the &ldquo;jarl of jarls&rdquo; and often had the final sayâ€”or axe blowâ€”in any heated discussion. He sits in the throne that faces north, as he should. Beneath Reggaryarva&rsquo;s throne is a vault dedicated to Thrym, the god of the frost giants.</p>

Ring of Thrones</h5><blockquote>
<p>Ice covers seven giant thrones arrayed in a ring atop a snow-covered hill. Scores of black ravens gather overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals an aura of necromancy around the ring of thrones and extending 10 feet beyond the outer edge of the ring. While in this area, creatures that do not have resistance or immunity to cold damage gain vulnerability to cold damage.</p>
<p>The characters can see the frost giant apparitions only if they step into the ring under the light of a full moon. Otherwise, the thrones are empty, and the characters have nothing else to interact with. The apparitions refuse to speak in the characters' presence, and they can&rsquo;t be harmed or turned. Barely lifting one finger, the apparition of Reggaryarva summons a frost giant skeleton (see appendix C) to challenge the party. If the skeleton is defeated, it disappears, and Reggaryarva summons two Invisible Stalker to carry on the fight. Each creature summoned in this manner appears in an unoccupied space of Reggaryarva&rsquo;s choice within the circle of thrones.</p>
<p>If the characters defeat the frost giant skeleton and the invisible stalkers, Reggaryarva is impressed and challenges them no more. Furthermore, the characters' triumph earns them a reward: access to the vault under the hill. The other six apparitions intone ancient words in Giant, causing Reggaryarva to fade away as his throne rises 30 feet into the air, revealing a hidden staircase that descends to area J2.</p>
<p>If she is present, Yselm Bloodfang betrays and attacks them as Reggaryarva&rsquo;s throne rises into the air. A winter wolf sent by the Frostmaiden joins the fray on Yselm&rsquo;s side. Both villains fight to the death.</p>
<p>When the full moon disappears below the horizon, Reggaryarva&rsquo;s throne slowly lowers back into place, sealing the vault entrance once more.</p>

Hall of Braziers</h5><p>Jarlmoot&rsquo;s underground vault is hewn out of rock and has flat, 25-foot-high ceilings throughout. As the characters descend the stairs, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To your left as you enter this dark hall is a closed, stone double door with no handles or hinges on this side. To your right is a curved tunnel blocked by an iron gate that has one-foot-square gaps between its horizontal and vertical bars. The iron hinges on the northern side of the gate indicate that it swings inward.</p>
<p>Situated in shallow alcoves at the far end of this hall are six braziers, each one in the shape of a four-foot-tall, two-foot-wide stone urn held snugly atop a five-foot-high, clawed basalt pedestal. Carved into each urn is a rune. Above the alcoves looms a stone archway, into which some words are inscribed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inscription carved into the arch above the alcoves is a poem written in the Dwarvish alphabet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snatch a scale from a sleeping wyrm;</p>
<p>Against the blowing wind, stand firm.</p>
<p>Climb a mountain with a stone in your shoe;</p>
<p>On little feet, death comes for you.</p>
<p>Be the arrow that starts the war;</p>
<p>Let life&rsquo;s blood fall till it falls no more.</p>

When the proper ingredients are placed inside one, magical fire fills the brazier. This fire destroys the brazier&rsquo;s nonmagical contents and burns for 1 hour. Only while all six braziers are lit can the gate to area J3 be opened.</p>
<p>Characters can find most of the ingredients they need in area J5. The poem (see above) provides clues to help the characters figure out which of the ingredients belongs in each brazier. For example, the first line of the poem contains the words &ldquo;scale&rdquo; and &ldquo;wyrm,&rdquo; suggesting that a dragon&rsquo;s scale is needed for the brazier that bears the wyrm rune.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wyrm (Dragon)</b> Dropping a dragon&rsquo;s scale in this brazier summons forth its fire. The characters can substitute some other dragon body part, such as a fang or a claw.</li>
<li><b>Vind (Wind)</b> Blowing air into this brazier lights its fire. No ingredient is required.</li>
<li><b>Fjell (Mountain)</b> Dropping a stone or a pebble from a mountain into this brazier summons forth its fire.</li>
<li><b>Dod (Death)</b> Dropping a Tiny, dead creature, or three drops of blood from any dead creature, into this brazier summons forth its fire.</li>
<li><b>Krig (War)</b> Dropping an arrow into this brazier summons forth its fire. The characters can substitute some other piece of ammunition, such as a crossbow bolt or sling stone.</li>
<li><b>Liv (Life)</b> Three drops of blood from a living creature must fall into this brazier to make its fire appear.</li>

<p>The portal is one-way only; it can&rsquo;t be seen or entered from area J1. The portal closes automatically after 10 minutes, causing the gold key to turn back to its original position. The portal closes instantly if the gold key is removed from the chest&rsquo;s lock.</p>

<p>This chamber holds four large wooden chests with iron fittings and built-in locks. Hanging from a hook in the middle of the ceiling is a one-foot-diameter iron ring with four one-foot-long iron keys and a single, one-foot-long silver key dangling from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The keys are sized appropriately for the locks on the oversized chests. To reach the ring of keys, the characters must either use magic to climb the walls or stack the chests on end and climb them. Other solutions might present themselves; try to reward the players' ingenuity. The ring of keys is too heavy to lift with a <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> spell, but the spell can be used to unscrew the hook from which the ring hangs, causing the keys to fall. The iron keys unlock the chests in this room. The silver key (which is worth 2 gp) unlocks the chest in area J4.</p>

That&rsquo;s a hard lesson for a rock gnome sorcerer to learn.</p>
<p>Five years ago, before Icewind Dale became the perpetually frozen hellscape it is today, Spellix Romwod was traveling through the mountain pass with a small caravan when it was caught in an avalanche. The goblins who triggered the avalanche captured Spellix&rsquo;s mates and dragged them back to their caves in the mountains to be eaten. Spellix, whom the goblins overlooked, followed them and devised a cunning plan to free his companions. Using materials scavenged from the wrecked caravan, he engineered a costume for himself. Disguised as a half-metal goblin, he infiltrated the goblins' lair and did his best to fit in, cleverly using <wc-fetch type=spell>silent image</wc-fetch> spells to hide the imperfections in his disguise. When he was offered a bone to gnaw on, his mechanical goblin mouth malfunctioned and wouldn&rsquo;t stop grinding its teeth. Thus, Spellix Romwod came to be known as Yarb-Gnock, which means &ldquo;Ever-Gnawing&rdquo; in Goblin.</p>
<p>Spellix was repulsed by the goblins' squalor and took pity on them. Abandoning all concern for his former mates, whom he didn&rsquo;t particularly like anyway, Spellix adopted the name given to him by the goblins and spent the next several months engineering ways to improve their standard of living. Long after the other members of the caravan had been eaten, Yarb-Gnock became the new chief after the previous one choked to death on a mountain goat tongue. By then, Yarb-Gnock had already drawn up plans to build a fortress in the mountains. Karkolohk, the Gnomish word for &ldquo;home,&rdquo; became the goblin tribe&rsquo;s dream of a better future.</p>
<p>As the goblins were finishing construction of their new home, everlasting winter descended upon Icewind Dale. Fewer caravans made their way through the mountain pass, forcing Chief Yarb-Gnock to send goblin wagons far and wide in search of food and resources. Despite his best efforts, the gnome-in-goblin&rsquo;s-clothing could sense that the tribe was becoming increasingly frustrated. The goblins felt like they were working harder for less, and a few are beginning to suspect that Chief Yarb-Gnock is a fraud.</p>
<p>Cooped up in the cold with creatures that would kill him if they learned the truth, Chief Yarb-Gnock is running out of ideas to keep the goblins motivated on other tasks and has begun to fear that the goblins are on to him. His costume is beginning to come apart, and paranoia has made him sleep-deprived. The number of &ldquo;traitors&rdquo; hurled from the mountaintop increases with every cycle of the moon, and the goblins don&rsquo;t know who among them are Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s loyal spies. Mistrust has infected every nook and cranny of Karkolohk.</p>
<p>Spellix Romwod was beginning to think that the time had come to abandon his goblin kin and seek refuge in Ten-Towns when, two days ago, his fortunes improved suddenly. Goblins out scavenging in a wagon stumbled across a curious object in the tundraâ€”a metallic, egg-shaped crate. (This object was jettisoned from an illithid nautiloid soon before it crashed in the mountains to the east, as described in &ldquo;<strong>area Id Ascendant</strong>"), Chief Yarb-Gnock thinks the crate might hold something wondrous, and getting it open has become his new obsession.</p>

Prisoners are kept in dangling cages until they freeze to death, whereupon the goblins cook and eat them.</p>
<p>Deep tracks left by goblin wagons lead to and from Karkolohk, making it easy to find despite the heavy snowfall. Once the characters are within the foothills and travel high enough to breach the clouds, the fortress becomes visible about from a mile away.</p>
<p>The fortress is worked into the spur of a mountain slope in a way that uses the natural environment to its advantage. Situated at the top of a hill, goblin lookouts have an excellent view of anyone approaching.</p>
<p>The weather in the mountains is so violent that Karkolohk&rsquo;s structures occasionally come loose and crash down the mountainside. Other times, chemistry experiments gone awry send wooden structures up in flames. Thus, the fort is always bustling with construction and repairs.</p>
<h5 id=goblin-mindset>
<a href=#goblin-mindset class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Goblin Mindset</h5><p>Chief Yarb-Gnock has taught the goblins to seize their destiny and stop at nothing to get what they want. Opportunistic creatures that they are, they take any sign of weakness as an opening to gain an advantage. If bullying and intimidation don&rsquo;t work, the goblins use more underhanded and passive-aggressive tactics. If they think that they are at a disadvantage or that they will come to an unavoidable loss, the goblins will do whatever they can to backtrack out of such a situation, be it through bribery, wheedling, or treachery.</p>
<p>Visitors are not welcome at Karkolohk. Moreover, the goblins who live here detest non-goblins, especially gnomes. Were the goblins just a little smarter, they would see through Chief Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s crude disguise and the magic he uses to hides its imperfections, and tear Spellix Romwod limb from limb.</p>

Assuming they avoid a violent altercation, the characters are escorted by a goblin to Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s dining hall (<strong>area area K11</strong>) for a private feast with the chief. This feast consists of a cooked mountain goat. What happens next depends on Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s goal, which can be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s goal is to make peace with Ten-Towns, he gives the party a rolled-up strip of rabbit hide at the end of the meal. On this strip of hide he has written a brief, formal notice in Common addressed to the Council of Speakers of Ten-Towns. It asserts that the goblins of Karkolohk will refrain from attacking travelers and caravans heading to and from Ten-Towns for as long as the peace treaty between Ten-Towns and Karkolohk lasts, and it bears Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s signature at the bottom. After handing them the message, Yarb-Gnock urges the characters to leave at once and deliver it to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander.</li>
<li>If Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s goal is to flee Karkolohk, the meal concludes with Yarb-Gnock requesting that the characters escort him to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander. Mistaking any attempt by Yarb-Gnock to leave Karkolohk as an abduction orchestrated by the characters, the goblins attack the characters as they try to flee the fortress with Yarb-Gnock in tow. During this escape attempt, Yarb-Gnock fights only in self-defense, counting on the characters to deal with any goblins that get in the way.</li>

Watchtowers</h5><p>The fortress has three of these squat structures, two overlooking the eastern approach and a third perched atop the cliffs to the west. Each watchtower stands 20 feet tall and has a rickety wooden ladder leading to the top, where a thick column of smoke issues from a brazier that is kept lit at all times.</p>
<p>Four Goblin dressed in cold weather clothing stand guard atop each tower. The rampart battlements grant them half cover against attacks from outside the fort. They are supposed to be looking outward for signs of trouble, but the goblins prefer to stand around the brazier for warmth. One goblin has a horn that it can blow to sound an alarm, putting the entire fortress on alert.</p>
<p>Since visitors aren&rsquo;t welcome at Karkolohk, the goblins shoot arrows at any they see. A character who wants to sneak past a watchtower or climb its ladder undetected must succeed on a DC 9 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check.

<p>Six Goblin shiver and stamp their feet atop the ramparts, trying to keep warm. They are a chatty bunch, making jokes at one another&rsquo;s expense. Each rampart has a wooden ladder leading up to it.</p>
<p>A character who wants to approach the gate undetected must succeed on a DC 9 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check. If multiple party members are attempting the same thing, have them make a group check instead. A character next to the gate can use an action to reach through it and try to pick the frozen padlock using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The courtyard warden (see area K3) carries the key to the lock.</p>

<p>Two rickety wooden bridges loom over this area at heights of thirty feet and fifty feet, respectively. The higher bridge is missing a large section of its middle, and what remains of that structure doesn&rsquo;t look safe.</p>
<p>Two iron cages hang from beams that extend southeast off the lower bridge. One of the cages twirls on its heavy iron chain as a flurry of black-feathered ravens tear into the flesh of the desolate creature caged within. Underneath the bridge is a worg with a rider on its back. The rider, swathed in cold weather clothing, appears to be a rather fat goblin. North and west of the higher bridge, resting in the snow, are three large, wooden cages, currently empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wooden cages were built to hold the polar bears that pull the goblins' wagons.</p>
<p>The goblin riding the worg is Snubsuk, the courtyard warden. His job is to lock and unlock the main gate at area K2. The worg charges toward intruders, causing Snubsuk to tumble off the worg&rsquo;s back and fall <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> in the snow.

<p>This thirty-foot-tall wooden watchtower is connected to the snowy ridges on either side of it by wooden bridges. Hanging off it are a pair of empty iron cages, and dangling underneath the tower&rsquo;s raised platform is a nine-foot-tall, golem-like construct with a helm-shaped head. This humanoid contraption is attached to an arrangement of ropes and pulleys that make it look like a giant marionette.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When announcements or rallying cries need to be made, the top of this tower is where Chief Yarb-Gnock stands to address the goblin tribe. No goblins are on it currently, although it sees a fair amount of traffic. A rickety wooden ladder runs from the platform to the ground. The underside of the platform is rigged with a system of ropes and pulleys that the goblins can use to hoist up anything heavier than a goblin, and the top of the platform has snow-covered hatches built into it that can be lifted away to get at the rigging underneath.</p>

It was heavily damaged in the crash; consequently, its hit point maximum is reduced to 80. To activate and control the shield guardian, the characters need its amulet, which is inside an ancient tower that broke away when Ythryn came down and crashed in the tundra (see &ldquo;<strong>area Lost Spire of Netheril</strong>"). They also need to operate the goblins' system of pulleys and ropes to lower it to the ground; figuring out how the system works requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.</p>
<p>The shield guardian was built by a Netherese wizard and is nearly two thousand years old. Carved into its massive forearms is the wizard&rsquo;s personal sigil. After the wizard&rsquo;s tower crashed, the guardian left the spire to go find help but got buried in an avalanche. It eventually shut down. Centuries later, a band of goblins dug it out and hauled it back to Karkolohk. Unfortunately for them, the guardian could not be reactivated. After some thought, Chief Yarb-Gnock decided to dangle it from this platform, using ropes and pulleys like puppet strings to make the guardian appear animate and terrifying. This construct must have been a lively sight to behold at one point, but the aura of menace surrounding it quickly faded, and the goblins lost all interest in it.</p>

<p>Each hut is home to a goblin healer in cold weather clothing. Each one owns a healer&rsquo;s kit. In addition, each healer has a pet mountain goat (see appendix C), from which it draws milk and which it can use as a mount. Each goat is usually tied to a post inside the healer&rsquo;s hut.</p>

She is wise enough to have seen through Chief Yarb-Gnock&rsquo;s disguise and is contemplating whether to blackmail the rock gnome or expose him.

Walk of Doom</h5><blockquote>
<p>A twenty-foot-long wooden walkway clings to the edge of a precipice. Its spiked railings are adorned with ribbons of shredded cloth and goblin skulls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever Chief Yarb-Gnock wants to make an example of a goblin, the poor wretch is dragged screaming to this walkway. The goblin can either hurl itself off the cliff to its death or die by the swords of its kin. The skulls belong to goblins who never made it to the end of the walkway. Ravens have picked the skulls clean.</p>
<p>The walkway was shoddily constructed and shows signs of having been repaired many times after being damaged by wind. If more than 200 pounds is placed on the outermost half of it, the whole thing snaps off and tumbles down the mountainside. Any creature on the walkway when it breaks off must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature leaps off and falls <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> on the ground near the slope. On a failed save, the creature falls 150 feet onto icy rocks with goblin bones scattered among them, taking 52 (<wc-roll>15d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage from the impact.</p>

<p>When the fortress comes under attack, the goblins who live here pull up their rope ladders, which makes getting to the huts difficult. A creature can reach a hut by scaling the icy cliff, but doing this requires a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

<p>Characters who undertake the &ldquo;Peace Out&rdquo; quest (see &ldquo;<strong>area Peace Out</strong>") are brought here to meet and dine with Chief Yarb-Gnock. The characters are expected to wait here until Spellix dons his Yarb-Gnock costume and emerges from his quarters (area K12). He engages in small talk until the food arrives about 10 minutes later.</p>
<p>When the room is not in use, a lone goblin stands guard inside the room near the eastern door, which is sealed shut with a wooden crossbar and has a shuttered peephole at goblin eye level. If someone knocks on the other side of this door, the guard peers through the peephole to see who&rsquo;s there. If it sees a friendly face, it lifts the crossbar and opens the door. A character can use an action to try to force open this door from the other side, breaking the crossbar with a successful DC 22 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.

Spellix Romwod (see the accompanying stat block) quickly dons his disguise if someone knocks on the door or tries to break it down, but it takes him 1 minute to do so. While putting on his goblin costume, Spellix makes light conversation (in Goblin) through the closed door to buy time.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The following boxed text assumes that Spellix has had time to don his disguise before the characters open the door. If they catch him in the act, modify the description accordingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This ten-foot-square room features two wooden shelves that hold half-dismantled objects and other junk. In the middle of the room, an odd-looking goblin in cold weather clothing stands next to a metallic, egg-shaped crate as big as he is. Nearby is a small, fur-lined cot and a brazier full of hot coals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who search the junk on the shelves find a set of tinker&rsquo;s tools and three trinkets (determined by rolling on the Icewind Dale Trinkets table in appendix A).</p>
<p>If the characters clearly portray themselves as enemies of the goblins, Spellix removes his goblin mask so that the characters don&rsquo;t mistake him for an enemy. If asked how he ended up in his current predicament, Spellix tells them he&rsquo;s a method actor training for the role of a goblin warlord in a play. (He can&rsquo;t help himselfâ€”he lies about everything.)</p>
<p>The characters can easily force Spellix to do what they say, since they are clearly mightier than his goblin horde. While in his Yarb-Gnock disguise, Spellix can be used as a hostage to facilitate the characters' escape, or he can command the goblins to stand down and allow the characters to leave the fort unmolested. If Manafek (see <strong>area area K6</strong>) is still alive, she might show up unexpectedly with a goblin posse and expose the impostor, forcing Spellix to put his fate in the characters' hands. If the characters surrender the gnome to the goblins, Spellix is hauled away to take the Walk of Doom (see <strong>area area K7</strong>), and the characters are free to go without further incident.</p>

Though it looks smooth, its surface feels tacky. It weighs 250 pounds and has a panel of flashing lights below its bulging midsection. The panel is a nine-digit keypad locking mechanism, and each glowing button has braille-like bumps on it. Spellix was unable to remove the keypad or crack open the crate, so he has been trying different combinations on the lock.</p>
<p>The characters won&rsquo;t be able to crack the eight-digit combination quickly, so the easiest way to open the crate is to cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell on it or pay someone in Ten-Towns to cast the spell (see &ldquo;<strong>area Magic in Ten-Towns</strong>").</p>
<p>Unlocking the crate causes the gibbering mouther contained inside it to spill out. It attacks all other creatures indiscriminately.</p>

The spire shattered into pieces as it embedded itself in the earth, upside down. There it has remained for centuries, buried under snow and ice.</p>
<p>The Netherese wizard who lived inside the spire did not survive the crash. The wizard&rsquo;s shield guardian not only survived but also dug its way out, creating a tunnel that others can use to reach the spire&rsquo;s interior. Until recently, the mouth of this tunnel was buried under ice and snow. After exiting the spire, the shield guardian wandered into the Spine of the World, where it shut down and was lost for centuries until a band of goblins found it recently and brought it to their mountain fort (see &ldquo;<strong>area Karkolohk</strong>").</p>
<p>The characters can learn about the spire in Ten-Towns (see &ldquo;<strong>area Tall Tales in Ten-Towns</strong>"), or they might stumble upon it accidentally while hunting (see &ldquo;<strong>area Hunt for the Red Yeti</strong>"). The NPC who tells the tale is willing to guide the characters to the spire&rsquo;s location for no less than 20 gp. After doing so, the guide wishes the party luck before heading back to Ten-Towns.</p>
<p>Before the characters face the challenges of the spire, review the information about Dzaan in the &ldquo;<strong>area Arcane Brotherhood</strong>&rdquo; section of appendix C. The details concerning Dzaan&rsquo;s simulacrum and bodyguard are especially pertinent, given what the characters are about to discover.</p>

The simulacrum is keen to activate the rune chamber on the lowest level (<strong>area area P16</strong>), because this room&rsquo;s magic can transform an illusory creature or object into a real one (within limits). The Dzaan&rsquo;s Simulacrum thinks it can use the rune chamber to turn itself into a flesh-and-blood clone of Dzaan, but activating the chamber requires a life-spark, which the simulacrum does not possess. Krintaas, who also lacks a life-spark, is impatiently waiting for Dzaan to return and quash the simulacrum&rsquo;s efforts to test the rune chamber. Neither the simulacrum nor Krintaas is aware that the real Dzaan is dead (see &ldquo;<strong>area Toil and Trouble</strong>").</p>
<p>When the characters show up, Dzaan&rsquo;s simulacrum is ecstatic. Finally, some potentially helpful living creatures have arrived! The simulacrum will bargain, befriend, threaten, or do whatever else it thinks might work in order to get one or more of them to accompany it to the rune chamber. If the characters know that the real Dzaan is dead and convey that information to the simulacrum, it becomes even more determined.</p>
<p>Once it learns that Dzaan is dead, Krintaas does whatever it takes to make sure the simulacrum gets the life-spark it needs to activate the rune chamber.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A twenty-foot-high, irregularly shaped spur of rock juts out of the tundra ahead of you. Its smooth and shiny surface cannot possibly have been worn down by the wind. No, this protrusion looks utterly out of place, as if it had been thrust into the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A character who examines the protrusion can make a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check to discern its nature. (The dwarves' Stonecunning trait can prove useful here.) On a successful check, the character can confirm that the stone is neither naturally formed nor manually hewn, but rather shaped by magic. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also discerns that that the protruding rock is of the top of a larger structure that continues underground.</p>

A character moving through the tunnel without the aid of climbing gear or magic must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check or slide uncontrollably to the bottom, landing <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> in <strong>area area P1</strong> but taking no damage.

<ul>
<li><b>Room and Door Heights</b> All rooms and passageways are 12 feet high, with flat ceilings and floors unless the text says otherwise. All doorways are 8 feet high and arched; being upside down turns them into concave, 4-foot-high barriers that must be surmounted to get from one room to another).</li>
<li><b>Tunnels</b> The shield guardian punched holes through the floor and gouged out tunnels in some places during its escape from the spire. Characters can use these openings to move between levels, but they&rsquo;ll need ropes or magic to ascend or descend safely.</li>

<p>Most of the books in this library have been destroyed by time and neglect. The group of adventurers Dzaan hired to help him search the spire removed all the books they considered valuable, including spellbooks. They left behind a few that might interest certain characters:</p>
<p><em>Magical Wonders of Netheril.</em> This book is a collection of interviews with Netherese archmages, who discuss their studies of ancient elven magic and the creation of <em>mythallars</em> (see appendix D). The book includes sketches of such devices.</p>
<p><em>Mysteries of the Phaerimm.</em> This book sheds light on the phaerimmâ€”telepathic, funnel-shaped monsters of malevolent intellect that lurk in the Underdarkâ€”and includes disturbing sketches of them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The members of the previous expedition searched through the books and plucked the best ones. Characters who thoroughly examine the remaining ones can find a couple of interest that are salvageable:</p>
<p><em>Ajamar&rsquo;s Guide to the Phantastic.</em> This breezy, lighthearted treatise on illusion magic was required reading in many Netherese classrooms. It describes clever ways to use common illusion spells.</p>
<p><em>The Unfettered Mind</em>. This lunatic text discusses how one might exist solely as a disembodied brain, preserved for eons in a magical suspension fluid. It includes sketches of brains in jars.</p>

Snow and Shadow</h5><p>Unless they&rsquo;re drawn to area P11 by a disturbance, Dzaan&rsquo;s simulacrum (see appendix C) and its wight bodyguard, Krintaas, are here. Omit the second paragraph from the following boxed text if these NPCs are not present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some effort has been taken to arrange the contents of this upside-down room, creating a functional office. A table stands in the middle of the room, surrounded by small stacks of books. Lying on the table is a whirring amulet on a chain.</p>
<p>Two figures stand behind the table. One is an undead warrior in studded leather armor, its dead-gray flesh drawn tightly over its bones and its face locked in a terrible scowl. The other is an attractive young man in cold weather clothing. His face, beneath a frayed witch&rsquo;s hat, displays studious eyes and a warm smile. &ldquo;Welcome to the lost spire of Netheril,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My name is Dzaan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who watched Dzaan&rsquo;s fiery execution (see &ldquo;<strong>area Toil and Trouble</strong>") recognize the young man as Dzaanâ€”back from the dead, or so it seems. The simulacrum, on the other hand, has never met the characters before. To earn their trust, it tries to be honest and forthcoming. It is self-aware enough to know what it is, but it can&rsquo;t grow or learn in its current form. It asks the characters to help it become a flesh-and-blood creature like the wizard who created it. It knows nothing about Dzaan&rsquo;s fate or the crimes for which the real Dzaan was executed.</p>
<p>In the course of a conversation, the simulacrum shares the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am a simulacrum of my creator. This tower is but a fragment of a Netherese flying city that crashed nearly two thousand years ago and lies somewhere under the glacier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the lowest level of this inverted tower, my creator found a chamber that can turn illusions into reality. The life-spark of a living creature is needed to activate its power. As a creation of snow and shadow, I have no life-spark of my own, and Krintaas, my undead bodyguard, is of no help in this regard. I assure you, the chamber can in no way harm anyone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dzaan&rsquo;s simulacrum lacks a spellbook. If attacked, its impulse is to turn <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and flee, then use its <wc-fetch type=spell>levitate</wc-fetch> spell to ascend the tower while Krintaas covers its escape. If it escapes the spire, it makes its way to Ten-Towns; as a thing made of ice and snow, the simulacrum can cross the tundra without fear of freezing to death.</p>

Dzaan retrieved it from <strong>area area P15</strong> and brought it here for examination. Neither the simulacrum nor Krintaas know what the amulet does, nor do they care. The simulacrum will happily give it to the characters if one or more of them agrees to accompany it to the rune chamber on the lowest level. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals a magical aura of enchantment around the amulet.</p>
<p>The amulet is a 4-inch-wide disk composed of silver-framed wood, with a rune carved into its face. (This rune matches the one on the shield guardian&rsquo;s forearms and is the personal sigil of the wizard who created both.)</p>
<p>This particular <wc-fetch type=item>shield guardian amulet</wc-fetch> is a rare magic item that requires attunement, and only humanoids can attune to it. A humanoid that attunes to the amulet knows the distance and direction of the shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane of existence. As an action, the amulet&rsquo;s attuned wearer can try to reactivate the shield guardian, doing so with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check. Reactivation can only be attempted while the amulet and guardian are within 10 feet of each other. The amulet otherwise functions as described in the shield guardian&rsquo;s entry in Monster Manual.</p>

<p><em>Lost Scrolls of Sabreyl.</em> Written in Elvish, this scholarly tome copies and analyzes fragments of eight ancient scrolls left behind by a sun elf wizard who taught magic to the cloud giants of Ostoria, a bygone empire that collapsed 40,000 years ago.</p>
<p><em>From Shadow, Substance</em>. This speculative work discusses how one might harness the Weave to turn an illusory object or creature into its real counterpart, with commentary and criticism from noteworthy Netherese illusionists.</p>
<p><em>Here Lies the King.</em> This elaborately plotted novel features an illusionist who uses magic to impersonate a prince, supplant a king, rule a fictional kingdom for sixty-one years, and fake his own death.</p>
<p><em>Ventatost</em>. This book uses testimonials and conspiracy theories to piece together events leading up to the destruction of a Netherese city called Ventatost, which disintegrated as it flew over the forest of Cormanthor nearly two thousand years ago, before the fall of Ythryn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A stone altar is attached to the ceiling of this otherwise empty, semicircular room. An eight-pointed star is carved into the eastern face of the altar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check recognize the symbol on the altar as the holy symbol of Mystryl, the first incarnation of Mystra, the god of magic. If this check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also knows that holy shrines to Mystryl are rare places and often full of mystery.</p>
<h6 id=altar>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic does not reveal the magical aura around the altar, which is protected by a permanent version of the <wc-fetch type=spell>Nystul&rsquo;s magic aura</wc-fetch> spell that conceals its magical nature. If a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> is cast on the altar (DC 18), followed by a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic, it radiates an aura of illusion magic.</p>
<p>The first time a character who can cast spells touches the symbol of Mystryl carved into the front of the altar, a stoppered flask filled with a luminous blue liquid appears in a shimmer of light &ldquo;atop&rdquo; the altar and immediately falls, shattering on the ceiling-turned-floor unless someone within reach catches it. Catching the falling flask requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If more than one character succeeds on this save, the one who rolled highest is the one who catches it. If the flask shatters, its contents evaporate instantly. Only one such flask can be created, after which the altar becomes nonmagical.</p>
<p>A character can use an <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic to determine the properties of the blue liquid in the flask. Any creature that drinks all of it gains the ability to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>minor illusion</wc-fetch> cantrip at will, using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability. If the creature that drinks the liquid can already cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>minor illusion</wc-fetch> cantrip, or if the liquid is consumed by more than one creature, nothing happens and the gift is wasted.</p>

Upside-Down Bedchamber</h5><blockquote>
<p>The bed in this room is upside down on the floor, its rotted blankets peeking out from underneath the disintegrating mattress. Mounted to the north wall is a tall, cracked mirror in a stone frame that merges seamlessly with the surrounding wall.</p>
<p>Lying underneath two dirt-clogged windows is a partially crumbled, rime-covered human skeleton in the tattered shreds of a nightgown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crumbling skeleton is all that remains of the Netherese wizard to whom this tower once belonged. Disturbing the remains causes the wizard&rsquo;s evil spirit, a will-o'-wisp, to appear and attack. If the will-o'-wisp loses more than half its hit points, it uses its next action to turn <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and haunts the characters for the remainder of their time in the spire, attacking solitary targets or those who can&rsquo;t fight back easily. The will-o'-wisp is bound to the spire and can&rsquo;t leave it, nor can it be appeased.</p>
<p>The mirror mounted on the north wall can be broken or taken down. Characters who slipped past the basilisk can use the mirror to reflect the basilisk&rsquo;s gaze.</p>

The chest has been made <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> by a spell that can be ended with a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 18). The chest has a built-in lock, the key to which can be found in area P11. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick the lock as an action, doing so with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check (with disadvantage if the character can&rsquo;t see the lock).</p>
<p>The chest weighs 25 pounds. It is airtight, watertight, and magical, such that its interior is a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius). It can be sold for as much as 100 gp.</p>
<p>Inside the chest is what appears to be an ancient, leather-bound spellbook that bears a rune on its spine identical to the one that appears on the shield guardian&rsquo;s control amulet in <strong>area area P12</strong>. The spellbook disintegrates a few seconds after the chest is opened. Whatever spells it once contained are forever lost.</p>

Upside-Down Rune Chamber</h5><blockquote>
<p>The walls of this chamber are inscribed with interconnected runes and marred with cracks. What is now the ceiling bears similar inscriptions that swirl inward, converging around a golden crystal disk five feet in diameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals an aura of transmutation magic encompassing the entire room. The first time someone enters the room, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An illusory figure appears upside down in the far corner of the room, standing on the ceiling. It appears to be the same long-faced human wizard depicted in the statues just inside the spire&rsquo;s entrance. It begins speaking in a strange, possibly forgotten, language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the illusory figure causes it to vanish. Otherwise, it disappears after giving its little speech. Once it goes away, the figment can&rsquo;t be summoned again for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Any creature that can understand Loross, the language favored by the wizards of Netheril, can translate the illusory wizard&rsquo;s words as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Behold my masterpiece! Here can illusions be made real, shadows become substance! Create your illusion, let it stand atop the crystal disk, and watch my rune chamber do its work!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dzaan&rsquo;s simulacrum can&rsquo;t learn anything new by studying the runes and crystals. However, any character who spends at least 1 minute doing so can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check, verify their purpose: to transform illusory creatures and objects into real ones. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also knows the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rune chamber can&rsquo;t produce magic items, animated objects, constructs, or undead.</li>
<li>A life-spark is needed to turn an illusory creature into a physical one. Acting much like a spark of electricity, it gives the room the jolt it needs to complete the transformation. (No such component is needed for objects.)</li>
<li>The cracks in the walls have damaged enough of the runes to compromise the room&rsquo;s magic, which might give rise to unexpected results. (Warning Dzaan&rsquo;s simulacrum about this risk does not discourage it from using the rune chamber.)</li>

See Dzaan&rsquo;s description in appendix C for information about modifying the simulacrum&rsquo;s stat block to account for its transformation into a clone of Dzaan. Krintaas remains by Dzaan&rsquo;s side as his faithful, undead bodyguard.</p>
<p>Dzaan&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to plunder Ythryn. Without his spellbook, however, the wizard is woefully underpowered. Concealed under layers of cold weather clothing, Dzaan and Krintaas must travel to Bryn Shander to obtain a blank spellbook, as well as writing supplies and provisions. In the meantime, Dzaan urges the characters to seek out and destroy his rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood. Dzaan assumes his rivals are hiding out in Ten-Towns and paints an unflattering portrait of each one:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Avarice is a tiefling evoker who delights in destruction. Her weakness is her paranoia. She can&rsquo;t bring herself to trust anyone except maybe her two gargoyle companions, and even they are suspect.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nass Lantomir is a human diviner. She likes to pry knowledge from others by reading their thoughts. Her weakness is that she&rsquo;s always looking ahead, never behind her.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Vellynne Harpell is a human necromancer, as cold and uncaring as the corpses she animates. She&rsquo;s a withered old fool whose greatest assetâ€”her family nameâ€”does her no good in Icewind Dale.&rdquo;</li>

Once there, they begin searching the uppermost level for food and treasure. The bugbears are cold and shivering, and their growls and complaints can be heard throughout the spire as they get their bearings.</p>
<p>The bugbear leader, Brekk, is a thug whose allegiance can easily be bought. Brekk and his gang serve anyone willing to feed them, and their loyalty can be bought with coin (2 gp per day per bugbear). Characters who have no interest in fighting the bugbears or hiring them as muscle can pay them 10 gp each to leave the spire at once and continue on their merry way.</p>

None of them appear on maps because they don&rsquo;t stay in one place for long.</p>
<p>Each Reghed tribe is made up of smaller clans, each with its own chieftain (the most powerful of whom often carries the title of king or queen). A clan might set up its camp for a tenday or two, then dismantle it and go back on the move, allowing the clan to stay close to a migrating herd of reindeer as it travels across the tundra.</p>
<p>The characters might be drawn to a Reghed camp by a tall tale or a quest (see &ldquo;<strong>area Tall Tales in Ten-Towns</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>area Wolf Tribe Cannibals</strong>"), or they might be led to a camp by Reghed scouts roaming the tundra (see &ldquo;<strong>area Wilderness Encounters</strong>"). The characters might also visit Reghed camps in chapter 5, as they face tests set before them by Auril the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>Before the characters find one of these camps, review the information on the Reghed tribes and their leaders in <strong>area appendix C</strong>. While it&rsquo;s not unheard of for clans of the same tribe to commingle and build their camps close to one another, the four tribes avoid contact with one another. Members of one tribe are rarely found in another tribe&rsquo;s camp unless some sort of diplomacy is taking place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Splayed across the tundra ahead of you is a campsite with more than a dozen tents arranged in two concentric rings, with the larger tents clustered near the middle. Between the tents burn several campfires. The air around the camp smells of cooked meat, and you can hear the barking and howling of dogs. Off to one side, outside the perimeter of tents, several empty sleds are clustered together.</p>
<p>Hulking figures dressed in thick hides and holding spears patrol the camp perimeter, looking outward for signs of danger. Other figures are gathered around fires or moving among the tents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six Reghed Warrior walk the perimeter. These guards tend to be younger warriors of the tribe.</p>
<p>A lone character can sneak into the camp undetected with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check. If multiple characters try to sneak in together, have them make a DC 10 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) group check instead. If either check fails, the guards shout loud enough to put the camp on alert (see &ldquo;Camp Roster&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>Reghed nomads, regardless of clan or tribe, try to capture intruders rather than kill them, giving the chieftain (or king or queen) the chance to question or punish them, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Although most Reghed tribe members are human, you can include nonhumans as well.</p>

Otherwise, the chieftain of this clan is a gladiator in hide armor who speaks Common and has <wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch> +5.</p>
<p>Reghed Great Warrior. Serving the chieftain as a bodyguard and executioner is a gladiator in hide armor who speaks Common and has <wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch> +5. This great warrior is often the chieftain&rsquo;s spouse, sibling, offspring, or childhood friendâ€”someone the chieftain trusts.</p>
<p>Reghed Shaman. The shaman, who advises the chieftain and presides over spiritual matters, is a druid who speaks Common and Druidic, and has <wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch> +4.

Scattered among these tents are campfires around which members of the clan like to gather. The tents are crude yet sturdy structures with wooden frames and walls made of layered bark and animal hides. A large tent can accommodate up to eight adults, and a smaller tent can provide shelter for up to five adults.</p>
<p>The tents in the inner circle house the clan&rsquo;s chieftain (or its king or queen), as well as other important tribe members such as its shaman, its most honored hunter, its greatest warrior, and the tribe&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>The tents in the outer circle house the clan&rsquo;s remaining members, which include crafters, weaponsmiths, and sled drivers. Sled dogs also sleep in these tents.</p>
<p>Many of the camp&rsquo;s hunters and warriors prefer to sleep under the open sky, protected from the cold by thick fur blankets and the heat of the campfires.</p>

Auril&rsquo;s everlasting winter has made hunting and travel more challenging, to be sure, but the tribes are weathering these difficult times by rationing their food and letting nothing go to waste. If anything, the Frostmaiden&rsquo;s cruelty has hardened the nomads' determination to survive. By following herds for their food and occasionally restocking on wood, the Reghed can get by without relying on trade. They shun Ten-Towns and expect to prevail long after those feeble lights of civilization have been snuffed out.</p>
<p>A Reghed camp is a somber and subdued place, except for the barking of sled dogs and the sounds of children playing in the snow. The warriors and hunters like to conserve their strength for when it&rsquo;s needed, preferring to spend their idle hours doing as little as possible. Telling familiar stories and inventing new ones that glorify the nomads' outlook on life are common pastimes (see the &ldquo;Reghed Stories&rdquo; sidebar), as is sharpening weapons.</p>
<p>Food is critical, of course, and certain beasts of the tundra are staples among the Reghed tribes. Knucklehead trout and seals are often prepared for eating very near the scene of the kill, filleted or chopped and generally eaten raw. Reindeer meat, on the other hand, must be cooked before consumption. Reindeer also provide the Reghed tribes with sinew, bone, and hide, all of which are used in the manufacture of weapons and armor.</p>

</li>
<li>

Situated on the frigid, misty coast of the Sea of Moving Ice, the prison is a single-story structure topped with battlements. Rising from the core of the panopticon is a tower that holds the prison&rsquo;s administrative offices and guard barracks. Both the prison and the tower are carved out of a tall, blade-shaped rock that rises high above the sea cliffs. This rock, called the Windbreak, shields the tower against the brutal winds that sweep down from the Reghed Glacier.</p>
<p>One can approach Revel&rsquo;s End by land, sea, or air. A pier allows prisoners to be taken from ships up an elevator to the prison, and a mooring dock at the top of the tower allows prisoners to be delivered by airship as well.</p>
<p>Revel&rsquo;s End is controlled by the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederation of settlements whose current members include the cities of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar; the towns of Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle; and the dwarven stronghold of Mithral Hall. To be imprisoned in Revel&rsquo;s End, one must have committed a serious crime against one or more members of the alliance and been sentenced to a lengthy period of incarceration (typically a year or more). Moreover, the offender must have political connections that make incarceration in another facility less dependable. Captured spies, for example, are often brought here to cool their heels.</p>
<p>Each member of the Lords' Alliance assigns one representative to Revel&rsquo;s End, and together they form a parole committee called the Absolution Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since Revel&rsquo;s End offers little in the way of comfort and amenities. If the council needs a tie-breaking vote to determine whether to commute a prisoner&rsquo;s sentence, the prison wardenâ€”a neutral arbiter with no ties to any Lords' Alliance memberâ€”casts the deciding vote.</p>

This villain last appeared in <em>Legacy of the Crystal Shard</em>, a published adventure also set in Icewind Dale. <em>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</em> presupposes that Vaelish Gant&rsquo;s plot to take over Ten-Towns was thwarted, and that he has been incarcerated at Revel&rsquo;s End for a few years before the start of this story.</p>
<p>The characters might also come to Revel&rsquo;s End hoping to book passage on a ship, as such vessels are known to bring prisoners and supplies to the prison. A ship can take them to Auril&rsquo;s island (see chapter 5) or allow them to flee the Far North altogether.</p>

These guards insist on confiscating the characters' weapons. In addition, one guard searches each character for concealed weapons. A character can conceal a dagger or similarly sized weapon from a guard&rsquo;s notice with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Sleight of Hand</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>If the characters have sled dogs or pack animals, a guard grants the party access to the stables (<strong>area area R5</strong>), where the animals can be kept safe. Animals aren&rsquo;t allowed in the prison otherwise.</p>
<p>After relinquishing their weapons and securing their animals, the characters are escorted by one of the guards to the meeting room (<strong>area area R12</strong>), where the warden greets them soon thereafter. The warden (see <strong>area area R21</strong>) tries to find out why the characters are at Revel&rsquo;s End and decides whether to help them or not. If the characters fail to provide a satisfactory reason for their visit, the warden sees that their weapons and animals are returned to them before throwing them out. Legitimate reasons for coming to Revel&rsquo;s End include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters seek shelter. The warden will grant them temporary accommodations (in <strong>area area R7</strong>) for up to two days and two nights, and the characters receive three meals a day during their stay.</li>
<li>The characters wish to meet with a prisoner. The warden can facilitate such a meeting by having the prisoner brought to <strong>area area R12</strong> for questioning. The warden is always present for such meetings.</li>

Circumstances that warrant taking such action include a prisoner revolt, an escape, the approach of an unfamiliar ship, a dragon sighting, or an attack.</p>
<p>By speaking the command word &ldquo;maristo,&rdquo; the wardenâ€”and only the wardenâ€”can put the prison on high alert, with the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>For 1 minute, the sound of a klaxon blares throughout the prison, and all <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells in the prison take on a reddish hue.</li>
<li>The guards in <strong>area area R19</strong> don their armor, arm themselves, and move to <strong>area area R18</strong>. The warden does the same and commands the garrison from there. Members of the Absolution Council retreat to <strong>area area R20</strong>.</li>
<li>The warden and all prison guards gain the benefit of a <wc-fetch type=spell>see invisibility</wc-fetch> spell.</li>

He takes his role seriously and never misses a council meeting or parole hearing. He votes with his head, not his heart, and always carefully weighs the ramifications of commuting a prisoner&rsquo;s sentence.</li>
<li><b>Councilor Jil Torbo</b> Jil represents the city of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate. She is a neutral halfling noncombatant who loathes her job. She has no sense of humor and a habit of sighing deeply when her patience is tested. She likes giving others the benefit of the doubt, however, perhaps as an act of dissent, and votes yes on commutations more often than not.</li>
<li><b>Councilor Kriv Norixius</b> Kriv represents the town of Daggerford. He is a lawful good dragonborn noncombatant of silver dragon ancestry. He hopes to impress the Duchess of Daggerford by doing a good job. He has no compassion for criminals and always votes no on commutations.</li>

Cells</h5><p>The prisoners are kept in these unlit cells behind barred gates that can be opened only from area R18. The gates are too secure to be forced open using brute strength or weapons, and magical attempts to open or bypass them are thwarted by permanent antimagic fields. Each field encompasses one cell and its gate. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in an antimagic field and can&rsquo;t protrude into it. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn&rsquo;t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>
<p>Bolted to the back wall of each cell is an iron bunkbed with a thin mattress atop it and a waste bucket nearby. Prisoners take their meals in their cells.</p>

She wears a red robe with gold trim and keeps a ring with seven tiny keys hanging from it in one pocket. One key unlocks the warden&rsquo;s chest (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below); the others unlock the desk drawer and the cabinets in the warden&rsquo;s office (area R22).</p>
<p>Warden Marthannis is secretly a member of the Harpers, a faction that works behind the scenes to keep power out of the hands of evildoers. In her current position, she works to keep some of the Sword Coast&rsquo;s worst malefactors behind bars.</p>
<p>So far, the warden has managed to conceal her Harper affiliation from everyone else in the prison. But she has an unusual problem that she can&rsquo;t hide as easily. Lodged inside her is the spirit of a deceased adventuring companionâ€”a lawful good shield dwarf fighter named Vlax Brawnanvil. The spirit of Vlax takes control of Warden Marthannis once or twice a day, each time for an hour or two. While under its control, the warden can&rsquo;t cast her prepared spells, speaks only Dwarvish, and occasionally indulges Vlax&rsquo;s vice for ale and spirits. She also becomes moody and temperamental, though never resorts to violence without good cause.</p>
<p>Warden Marthannis knows that to rid herself of Vlax&rsquo;s spirit, she must visit the Brawnanvil crypts in Gauntlgrym, a dwarven fortress under Mount Hotenow (near Neverwinter). Only there can the spirits of Vlax&rsquo;s kin persuade Vlax to join them in the afterlife. The warden refuses to make the journey, however, because she can&rsquo;t bear to lose all contact with Vlax. The warden has made her affliction known to the prison guards and Absolution Council members, and they have grown accustomed to her personality changes and bouts of drunkenness.</p>

He hoped that his work would help the Arcane Brotherhood gain control of the region. A few years ago, shortly after his arrival in Ten-Towns, Gant established a protection racket in Bryn Shander and tried to turn the town against its speaker, Duvessa Shane, with the goal of supplanting her. He also tried to destabilize the economy of Ten-Towns. A party of adventurers thwarted his criminal ventures by capturing him.</p>
<p>Rather than put Gant to death for his crimes in Icewind Dale, the Council of Speakers in Ten-Towns made a deal with representatives of the Lords' Alliance to have Gant serve a life sentence in Revel&rsquo;s End, so as not to incur the Arcane Brotherhood&rsquo;s wrath. The Council of Speakers did this not realizing that Gant&rsquo;s scheme wasn&rsquo;t sanctioned by the Arcane Brotherhood but rather hatched by Gant himself, who intended to impress his superiors by pulling it off.</p>
<p>For a long time, Gant held out hope that the Arcane Brotherhood would apply pressure to secure his release, and that the Lords' Alliance would acquiesce to the brotherhood&rsquo;s demands rather than risk an all-out attack on Revel&rsquo;s End. But by now, Gant has been incarcerated long enough to reasonably conclude that no such rescue is forthcoming. His failed scheme was an embarrassment to the Arcane Brotherhood, which has clearly forsaken him.</p>

Pompous and conniving, he never doubts that he&rsquo;s the smartest person in the room, and he makes sure everyone around him knows how he feels.</p>
<p>Gant has neither a spellbook nor material components for spellcasting, and he can&rsquo;t avail himself of his magic while locked in his cell due to the antimagic field that encompasses it.</p>
<p>Gant spends his days and nights thinking about one thing: his freedom. If the characters meet with him, Gant tries to convince them to break him out of jail, promising wealth and magic items once delivered safely to the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan. Gant doesn&rsquo;t expect the characters to oblige, but he has nothing left to lose but his life.</p>
<p>Although he&rsquo;s unaware of any Arcane Brotherhood activities in Icewind Dale, Gant suspects that something is afoot if the characters start asking him about the organization. The last time he was at the Hosttower, shortly before his arrival in Ten-Towns a few years ago, Gant overheard his superiors talking about mounting an expedition to Icewind Dale, to search for a lost Netherese city buried under the Reghed Glacier. Gant had different plans for Icewind Dale at the time, but now the characters' visit gives him reason to believe an expedition might finally be under way. Gant shares this information with the characters if they show him the letter from Duvessa Shane (see &ldquo;<strong>area Behind Bars</strong>") or break him out of prison.</p>
<p>Gant has no information that can help the characters find the lost Netherese city, but he&rsquo;s willing to share what he considers to be common knowledge about the Empire of Netheril:</p>
<ul>
<li>Netheril was a civilization ruled by powerful wizards. It fell more than a thousand years ago.</li>
<li>The Netherese learned their magic first from the elves, and later from the fabled <em>Nether Scrolls</em>. Netherese magic was far more powerful than present-day magicâ€”so much so that it made even the gods tremble.</li>
<li>Evil, subterranean creatures known as phaerimm were instrumental in Netheril&rsquo;s fall, but it was hubris that ultimately spelled the empire&rsquo;s doom. Karsus, a Netherese archmage, tried to usurp the power of Mystryl, god of magic. He failed, destroying himself and tearing the Weave in the process. It would be years before anyone could use or control magic again.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters ask Gant about other members of the Arcane Brotherhood they&rsquo;ve met in Icewind Dale (see <strong>area appendix C</strong>), Gant can share what he knows about any of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>About Avarice, Gant says: &ldquo;The tiefling albino? I think she has a promising future.&rdquo;</li>
<li>About Dzaan, Gant says: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Red Wizard of Thay. Need I say more?&rdquo; (If asked to elaborate, he adds: &ldquo;Dzaan doesn&rsquo;t shave his head or wear red robes, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that he&rsquo;s Thayan. The Red Wizards want the Weave all to themselves. If they get their way, no one else will be able to use magic.")</li>
<li>About Nass Lantomir, Gant says: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a nobody.&rdquo;</li>
<li>About Vellynne Harpell, Gant says: &ldquo;Had powerful members of her family not pulled strings to get her into the Brotherhood, that old scarecrow would still be reanimating dead cats in Longsaddle.&rdquo;</li>

Read both entries before running encounters in either location. Also review the &ldquo;<strong>area Goliaths</strong>&rdquo; entry in appendix C, in particular the &ldquo;<strong>area Spine of the World Goliaths</strong>&rdquo; section. There is also a list of goliath names you can draw from, as needed.</p>
<p>Characters might visit Skytower Shelter to resolve a long-standing dispute between the two goliath clans (see &ldquo;<strong>area Tall Tales in Ten-Towns</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>area A Goliath Problem</strong>"). Or a goliath player character who hails from Skytower Shelter might return home for some reason, perhaps to seek help with matters concerning Icewind Dale.</p>
<p>All goliaths who dwell in Skytower Shelter are members of the Akannathi clan. In addition to their feud with the goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag, Skytower goliaths are known for their fierce competitiveness, their dislike of strangers, and their mastery of griffon taming.</p>

If they see unfamiliar figures ascending the causeway, the griffons shriek warnings to the goliaths of Skytower Shelter. The goliaths quickly arm themselves, expecting trouble.

<p>Six griffons circle above you, shrieking at your approach. They descend until they&rsquo;re a few hundred feet away but come no closer.</p>
<p>At the end of the entranceway is a ten-foot-tall barricade made of wood and stone, set with a crude gate made of thick lumber and festooned with metal blades. Gaps in the gate allow you to see an unusually tall figure in hide armor standing ten feet behind it and clutching a greataxe. Beyond this figure is a higher ledge with five equally towering figures standing atop it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure beyond the gate is a goliath warrior (see <strong>area appendix C</strong>) named Arn Rockfist Akannathi, the chieftain of Skytower Shelter. The figures atop the overlook (<strong>area area S3</strong>) are five more Goliath Warrior.</p>
<p>If the party includes one or more goliath characters who hail from Skytower Shelter, Arn welcomes them home and allows them and their companions to pass through the gate unmolested. Otherwise, Arn tells the party in a deep and gravelly voice, &ldquo;Turn back. You are not welcome here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two 500-pound wooden bars seal the gate. The blades affixed to the gate and the surrounding barricade make climbing impossible. The goliaths attack anyone who bypasses the gate without Arn&rsquo;s consent. Nine Goliath Warrior from area S9 join the fray on the third round, and the six Griffon circling above join the battle on the fifth round. Arn can also whistle to summon these reinforcements at any time.</p>

If the characters don&rsquo;t have one or more Skytower goliaths among them, the only way they can get past Arn is to give him something he wants. If the characters ask him what he wants, he tells them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goliath thinks for a moment, then points toward a neighboring mountain to the northeast. &ldquo;Bring me the white cloak of Ogolai, the chieftain of Wyrmdoom Crag.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Arn is asked why the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths don&rsquo;t get along, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Many summers ago, the children of Skytower challenged the children of Wyrmdoom to a game of goat-ball. One of the children of Wyrmdoom, angered at being knocked off her perch, threw the ball at one of our griffons and struck it in the head. It wounded her in return. The game was called off. Days later, hunters from Wyrmdoom climbed our mountain and slew the griffon in its nestâ€”a grave insult. We have been at war ever since.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who speak to Ogolai, the chieftain of Wyrmdoom Crag, get a different version of the story (see &ldquo;<strong>area Wyrmdoom Crag</strong>").</p>
<p>If the characters portray themselves as neutral arbiters seeking to end the conflict between the clans, Arn suggests they end the conflict by bringing him the cloak of the Wyrmdoom chieftain, either by killing Ogolai and taking it from her or by forcing Ogolai to surrender it. Arn aims to use the characters as tools to weaken his rival and doesn&rsquo;t care if they succeed or die.</p>
<p>Only by restoring Kaniaka&rsquo;s sight (see <strong>area area S4</strong>) can the characters convince Arn to meet with Ogolai and settle their differencesâ€”and only at Skytower Shelter or on neutral ground.</p>

Chieftain&rsquo;s Cave</h5><blockquote>
<p>This twelve-foot-high cave has a crackling fire in its center and walls lined with hunting trophies, including the skulls and pelts of various mountain-dwelling creatures. Seated by the fire is a wizened goliath with long white hair. A yeti fur cloak is draped over her stooped shoulders, and a tiger-sized feline with white fur crouches beside her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cave is where Arn spends time with his family, namely his husband, Harad Cloudstrider Akannathi (a goliath warrior), and Harad&rsquo;s elderly mother, Kaniaka Stormcrow Akannathi (a blind noncombatant). Each of them has private quarters off the main cave, where they keep their bedrolls.</p>
<p>If the characters fought their way to this cave by killing other goliaths, Harad is awake and attacks them, since the fallen goliaths are his blood. Otherwise, Harad is asleep in his bedroll while Kaniaka sits by the fire, staring at it sightlessly, with a domesticated crag cat (see appendix C) by her side. The cat protects Kaniaka but otherwise takes no aggressive actions.</p>
<p>Kaniaka&rsquo;s hearing is sharp enough to distinguish the heavy footfalls of goliaths from those of smaller folk. She is suspicious of strangers just as other members of her clan are, but at her age, she feels compelled to listen to what they have to say. She would very much like to see an end to the conflict with the Wyrmdoom goliathsâ€”if such a thing is possible.</p>
<p>Magic can cure Kaniaka&rsquo;s blindness, and she becomes indebted to any character who restores her vision. Kaniaka is the only member of the Akannathi clan who has as much influence in Skytower Shelter as Arn does, and once her sight is restored, she can gently persuade him to listen to reason. With her help, the characters can convince Arn to meet with the chieftain of the Wyrmdoom goliaths, though he insists that any such meeting take place at Skytower Shelter.</p>
<p>Any conversation with Kaniaka awakens her son, who stumbles out of his bedchamber with greataxe in hand to confront intruders. If the characters have gotten off on the wrong foot with Kaniaka, Harad threatens to punish them for their intrusion, though his sense of honor dictates that he cannot draw first blood. Thus, he tries to goad characters into wounding him first.</p>

Griffons' Cave</h5><p>The floor of this cave is 15 feet beneath the floor of area S5. A 5-foot-diameter, 5-foot-long chute with carved footholds extends upward from the ceiling of this cave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This fifteen-foot-high cave contains four griffon nests: three clustered in the middle of the cave and one to the north. The northernmost nest contains a full-grown griffon that appears to be sound asleep. The wind stirs the sleeping griffon&rsquo;s feathers as it enters through a wide opening in the north wall, beyond which you can see mountain peaks and storm clouds. Sitting on the edge of this opening is a goliath who is talking gently to a griffon youngling that leans against her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come no closer,&rdquo; warns the goliath. &ldquo;This youngling is afraid to fly, and his mother is trying to get some rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A smaller, 10-foot-high cave to the northeast contains a goliath-sized bedroll that belongs to the goliath. She is Rahi Skydreamer Akannathi, a goliath warrior with <wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch> +4 and <wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch> +4. Rahi serves as the clan&rsquo;s spiritual guide and chief caretaker of the griffons living in and around Skytower Shelter. The Young Griffon (Tiny) in her care is less than a year old and has yet to overcome its fear of flying. Its mother, a griffon, awakens and attacks if she, her offspring, or Rahi is threatened. If need be, Rahi can whistle to summon two more Griffon perched on the nearby slopes; these reinforcements arrive on the third round of combat.</p>
<p>Like the other members of her clan, Rahi is distrusting of strangers and doesn&rsquo;t abide intrusions. A character who offers to help Rahi overcome the youngling&rsquo;s fear of flying can, with a successful DC 18 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check, get Rahi&rsquo;s permission to approach the youngling. That character can then attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check to calm it. On a failed check, the youngling tries to nip the character with its beak, and Rahi sends the character away. On a successful check, Rahi is impressed as the baby griffon warms to the character.</p>
<p>If the party earns Rahi&rsquo;s trust and friendship, she might approach a goliath member of the party and offer to teach that character how to tame a griffon. Given the time commitment necessary, this activity is most likely to occur after the adventure concludes or during a lengthy period of downtime (see the &ldquo;Griffon Taming&rdquo; sidebar below).</p>

The clan&rsquo;s griffon trainer, Rahi, shares these secrets with clan members who show great wisdom. The goliaths don&rsquo;t ride the griffons; rather, they train them to hunt like falcons. The griffons are taught to respond to goliath whistles and never stray too far from their masters.</p>
<p>A goliath character who earns Rahi&rsquo;s respect can be taught the secrets of griffon taming over a period of 1 year, during which time the character is entrusted to watch over and protect a single griffon egg and, when it hatches, the emergent griffon youngling. At the end of the year, if the griffon is still alive, the character must make a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check, with advantage if the character accepts Rahi&rsquo;s guidance. If the check fails, the character is unable to tame the griffon. If the check succeeds, the character tames the griffon and bonds with it for life. Control of the griffon can be given to the goliath&rsquo;s player at this time.</p>

<p>This rough-hewn passageway slopes gently upward to the south. Ensconced torches illuminate carvings on the walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The carvings depict the history of the Akannathi clan. This saga begins at the north end of the passage and unfolds as one travels south toward area S9. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check can determine that the oldest carvings are roughly 400 years old and the newest ones are quite recent.</p>
<p>The earliest carvings tell the story of how the Akannathi goliaths tamed the mountainâ€”how they dug tunnels and caves to serve their needs, creating a home for their people, and how they tamed the griffons of the mountain, turning these ravenous monsters into stalwart hunting companions. Later carvings focus on wars against the orcs, when the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths were united against a common foe. Carvings made within the past century chronicle the souring of the friendship between the two goliath clans, with scenes showing warriors of Wyrmdoom Crag slaying griffons followed by bloody skirmishes between the goliath clans on mountainsides. The newest carvings depict lone goliaths chasing a giant polar bear (a representation of Oyaminartok, as described in appendix C) and a diminished population of Skytower goliaths contending with the seemingly endless winter.</p>

If they were drawn to <strong>area area S2</strong> by a disturbance, adjust the following boxed text to account for their absence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A long, rectangular firepit heats this fifteen-foot-high cave and fills the area with the scent of meat cooking on a grate over the pit. The sound of cheering also fills the cave as two goliaths stand near the southern wall with their arms extended out from their sides, holding a large rock in each hand. Their arm muscles are quivering from exertion, and their jaws are clenched. Seven more goliaths stand around them, cheering and waving haunches of cooked meat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the goliaths become aware of the characters, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the goliaths spot you, they stop cheering. The competition ends as the two goliaths let their rocks tumble to the floor, and all nine goliaths glare at you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two goliaths were competing in a test of strength to see who could hold their arms up the longest under the weight of the rocks. Unless the characters are accompanied by a member of the Akannathi clan, the goliaths try to frighten away the interlopers, attacking them if they refuse to leave. A clever character can win over the goliaths by challenging and beating one or more of them in a rock-holding contest. The contest plays out as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each participant is given a pair of heavy rocks and must hold one in each hand while keeping their arms parallel to the floor.</li>
<li>At the end of each minute, each participant must succeed on a Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check to keep their arms raised. The DC starts at 5 and increases by 5 at the end of each minute thereafter. On a failed check, the participant drops their arms and is out of the game. If the last two participants fail at the same time, the contest ends in a tie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any character who wins a rock-holding contest earns the respect of the goliaths in this cave. That respect can grow into friendship, provided the characters have done nothing that would turn the goliaths against them.</p>

Characters who want to end the feud between the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag must convince the chieftains, Arn and Ogolai, to meet on neutral ground, away from their respective lairs, since neither chieftain wants to appear weak in the eyes of the other.</p>

Ogolai will agree to meet Arn on neutral ground, but only if the characters heal the wounded aarakocra at Wyrmdoom Crag (see <strong>area area W6</strong>). Both chieftains intend to bring an entourage of goliath warriors with them to the meeting, and it takes some additional diplomacyâ€”and perhaps a Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check or twoâ€”to convince them to keep their delegations small.</p>

If one or more characters don&rsquo;t mediate the conversation, the meeting ends with each chieftain walking away in disgust at the other&rsquo;s unwillingness to accept blame. Allow the players time to devise a strategy for ending the impasse. Three possible solutions are presented below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters urge the chieftains, for the good of Icewind Dale, to unite against a common foe (such as Auril the Frostmaiden, Arveiaturace the White Wyrm, or Xardorok Sunblight). Goliath warriors from both clans, working as allies, might learn to forget the past and forge a brighter future for all goliaths.</li>
<li>A character who has earned the respect of one or both clans convinces either chieftain that being the first to accept responsibility for a misunderstanding, even when others should share the blame, is a sign of moral strength and good character. Once one chieftain accepts blame, it&rsquo;s easier for the other to do the same.</li>
<li>The characters keep the chieftains talkingâ€”for days, if that&rsquo;s what it takesâ€”by turning it into a contest of endurance. The two chieftains waste hours airing their grievances, then spend longer hours glaring at each other in stubborn silence. (The characters' patience is eventually rewarded when Ogolai has food and tea brought to her. She offers to share her repast with Arn, who begrudgingly accepts out of politeness. This moment marks a turning point as the chieftains agree that there can be no winner to this contest and, more important, that the contest is a metaphor for their pointless, long-standing feud.)</li>
</ul>

Read both entries before running encounters in either location. Also review the &ldquo;<strong>area Goliaths</strong>&rdquo; entry in appendix C, in particular the &ldquo;<strong>area Spine of the World Goliaths</strong>&rdquo; section. There is also a list of goliath names you can draw from, as needed.</p>
<p>Wyrmdoom Crag is home to the friendly Thuunlakalaga goliath clan. Shortly after establishing this lair for themselves, the goliaths were challenged by an adult white dragon. The dragon underestimated the goliaths' determination, and decades later, its skeletal remains still lie nearby as a testament to their triumph.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why the characters might visit Wyrmdoom Crag:</p>
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;re drawn to the location by a tall tale (see &ldquo;<strong>area Tall Tales in Ten-Towns</strong>") or by a quest to help Dannika Graysteel acquire some white dragon bones (see &ldquo;<strong>area Dragon Bone Stew</strong>").</li>
<li>One of the characters is a goliath from Wyrmdoom Crag who wants to return home.</li>
<li>The characters seek to end the feud between the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag. (The characters will need to visit both locations to succeed in their mission.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Wyrmdoom goliaths are willing to share their dwelling with travelers and guests, but they hold a strong dislike for the goliaths of Skytower Shelter. The characters can learn the cause of that resentment by speaking to Ogolai, chieftain of the Thuunlakalaga clan.</p>

The bones of an adult white dragon rest near the entrance to the lair.</p>
<p>The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag enjoy company and will trade food and shelter for stories and news from Icewind Dale. The goliaths are rich in stories of their own and are not shy about sharing their history.</p>
<p>Although these goliaths are friendly and welcoming, they bear a bitter grudge against the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and will treat any character hailing from that clan accordingly. Additionally, these goliaths have a strong distaste toward visitors who seek to stir up trouble beyond simple competitiveness. If such a situation occurs, they expel the offending visitor.</p>

Approach</h5><blockquote>
<p>Fresh tracks in the snow make it relatively easy to find the goliath settlement of Wyrmdoom Crag on the northern slope of a soaring mountain. Following these tracks leads you to a cave, outside which the bones of a dragon lie half-buried in the snow. Past these remains, torchlight flickers in a pair of tunnels that burrow into the mountain leading west and south.</p>
<p>East of the dragon&rsquo;s bones, rough-hewn steps climb to a twenty-foot-high, open-air arena with stone bleachers carved into the eastern wall. Rising from the arena floor are more than a dozen pillars of rock, each five to eight feet tall and about a foot in diameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tracks in the snow were made by two goliath warriors returning from a hunt. See <strong>area area W2</strong> for more about the stone platform and the bleachers.</p>
<p>The bones are those of an adult white dragon named Stygiarus, which met its doom at the hands of the goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag. Four Chwinga (see appendix C) lurk amid the bones and make their presence known by popping out as the characters approach. The chwingas follow the characters around for as long as the party remains in the vicinity of Wyrmdoom Crag. The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag are aware of the chwingas and usually ignore them.</p>
<p>Each chwinga has a fascination for something and is irresistibly drawn to any character who has or demonstrates that certain something. If a character indulges a chwinga&rsquo;s fascination once a day for three consecutive days, the chwinga rewards that character with a supernatural gift before it departs (see &ldquo;Supernatural Gifts&rdquo; in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). See the &ldquo;New Chwinga Charms&rdquo; section in appendix C for more charms. Each chwinga&rsquo;s fascination is described below:</p>
<p><strong>Chwinga 1</strong> has a white face with a dark triangle painted over one eye. It is fascinated by Small characters and tries to ride around on them.</p>
<p><strong>Chwinga 2</strong> has a white face with two concentric blue rings around one eye. It is fascinated by beards and likes to comb them with a pinecone.</p>
<p><strong>Chwinga 3</strong> has curly black antennae growing out of its head. It is fascinated by whistling and by its own reflection. It capers enthusiastically whenever a character makes whistling noises or puts a mirror in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>Chwinga 4</strong> wears a gown made of pine needles. It is fascinated by characters who chew with their mouths open and tries to look down their throats while they eat.</p>

<p>Fifteen crude stone pillars stand on this raised arena. The bleachers carved into the back wall are sheathed in ice, and at the top of the seating section are burnt torch stubs in sconces and a narrow tunnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag gather here at least once a day to watch children or adults enjoying a game of goat-ball (see the &ldquo;Goat-Ball&rdquo; sidebar). If the characters endear themselves to the goliaths, four Goliath Warrior from <strong>area area W7</strong> challenge them to a friendly goat-ball match. Characters who turn down the challenge are free to watch a game instead. The goliaths don&rsquo;t mind a little betting on the side.</p>

<p>After learning the lessons needed to become full-fledged adults, a young goliath offers up a symbol of their childhoodâ€”a dollâ€”and crawls through the tunnel. Members of their family wait for them on the other side, ready to welcome them into adulthood. The visions seen by those who crawl through the tunnel force them to face their fears, experience what it means to be truly alone, and recognize their own weaknesses. Not everyone has the fortitude to make it through the tunnel on the first attempt, but those who fail can try again.</p>
<p>Visitors who want to experience this trial are warned that it is not for the faint of heart. A character who reaches the tunnel&rsquo;s midpoint must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw and a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If either save fails, the character is unable to move forward and must withdraw the way they came. If both saves fail, the character is so overwhelmed by visions of terror that they fall into a coma, becoming <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> for <wc-roll>4d6</wc-roll> hours. A character who succeeds on both saving throws can crawl through the tunnel and out the other side, having confronted the visions and overcome them.</p>

Main Hall</h5><blockquote>
<p>This cavern has a domed roof thirty feet high and an open well in the middle of the floor. Two youthful goliaths use ropes and a bucket to draw water from the well while six adults wrangle a handful of exuberant goliath toddlers.</p>
<p>Rough-hewn stairs ascend to the southern part of the cave, where the floor is ten feet higher. Seated in this area next to a crackling fire is a female goliath with gray hair, many scars, and a white cloak made of mountain goat hide. Leaning against the wall behind her is a greataxe with a bone haft. She gnaws on a pipe as she tries to settle a dispute between two goliath children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cave is where most members of the Thuunlakalaga clan sleep and socialize. Bedrolls of goatskins and furs are set out on the floor in a loose semicircle around a well in the center of the room.</p>
<p>When the characters arrive, the cave contains eight Goliath Warrior&rdquo; below). If a fight erupts here, nine more Goliath Warrior arrive from <strong>area area W7</strong> to help put an end to it.</p>
<p>Ogolai greets new arrivals and invites them to join her by the fire. If she takes a shine to them, she walks them back to the feasting cave (<strong>area area W7</strong>) for a hot meal. If she is asked why the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths don&rsquo;t get along, Ogolai says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Many summers ago, the children of Wyrmdoom challenged the children of Skytower to a game of goat-ball. During the game, the ball tumbled near one of the griffons of Skytower. When one of our children tried to fetch the ball, the griffon went berserk and grievously wounded her. The game was called off. Hungry for more of the child&rsquo;s flesh, the griffon haunted Wyrmdoom for days. Our hunters were forced to kill it to protect the child. The two clans have been opposed ever since.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although she doesn&rsquo;t say so, Ogolai is the child who was wounded by the griffon, as the scars on her face suggest. To this day, she fears griffons and blames the Skytower goliaths for not keeping theirs under control.</p>
<p>If the characters claim to be neutral arbiters seeking to end the conflict between the clans, Ogolai says she&rsquo;s prepared to meet with Arn Akannathi, the leader of the Skytower goliaths, but refuses to meet him at Skytower Shelter. Ogolai insists that the meeting occur on the goat-ball court at Wyrmdoom Crag, which she knows Arn will never agree to. Ogolai&rsquo;s refusal to conduct negotiations at Skytower Shelter stems from her deep-seeded fear of griffons, though she would never admit to this fact lest she appear weak. Ogolai is not interested in offering any goodwill gesture to Arn, whom she bluntly calls a &ldquo;walking stillborn.&rdquo;</p>

Private Caves</h5><p>These 10-foot-high caves are the quarters of the chieftain and the best warriors of the clan. Ogolai claims the southernmost cave, where the tribe&rsquo;s valuables are kept (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The northernmost cave contains a wounded aarakocra named Sikki-kree, who is being tended to by a goliath warrior named Aruk Thundercaller Thuunlakalaga, who has <wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch> +4 and <wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch> +4. Sikki-kree crashed in the mountains when she was caught in a blizzard and was rescued by goliath hunters. Aruk has been nursing the aarakocra back to health, but he can do only so much. Although Sikki-kree&rsquo;s minor wounds have healed, she has a broken wing that requires at least 10 hit points of magical healing to be mended. The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag have no such magic at their disposal. Any character who helps Sikki-kree regain her ability to fly earns the aarakocra&rsquo;s gratitude and the respect of the Wyrmdoom goliaths.</p>
<p>Once Sikki-kree can fly again, she thanks the characters for their help before getting Ogolai&rsquo;s permission to depart. Ogolai is indebted to the characters for helping the aarakocra, enough that she will agree to a meeting with the chieftain of the Skytower goliaths if the characters request one.</p>

The Wyrmdoom goliaths have little use for valuables but keep this stockpile for clan members who visit Ten-Towns or other settlements and need some form of currency to secure food or lodging. The stockpile includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>350 gp, 1,177 sp, and 1,850 cp in mixed coinage</li>
<li>Sixteen gemstones: nine banded agates (10 gp each), four carnelians (50 gp each), two spinels (100 gp each), and a topaz (500 gp)</li>

Feasting Cave</h5><blockquote>
<p>Three adult goliaths are cooking meat over a rectangular firepit in the middle of this fifteen-foot-high cave while a goliath youth distributes ceramic bowls of food to other goliaths sitting around the room on woolly rugs and furs.</p>
<p>An elderly male taps a rhythmic beat on a large goatskin drum held between his knees. While he plays, a couple of goliaths wrestle on the floor in front of him. Those seated near them occasionally move out of the way when the wrestlers roll too close to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless the warriors have been drawn elsewhere, this cave nine Goliath Warrior plus eight goliath noncombatants (children and clan elders).</p>
<p>The Wyrmdoom goliaths are overjoyed if one or more characters express an interest in wrestling. Although the goliaths don&rsquo;t customarily take on smaller or weaker opponents, they never refuse a challenge. Winning a wrestling match requires a competitor to succeed on two consecutive contested Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) checks.</p>
