<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>After opening a fissure in the Reghed Glacier, a party of explorers prepares to head inside.</p>
<p>Equipped with the &ldquo;Rime of the Frostmaiden,&rdquo; the characters can begin their search for the lost Netherese city buried deep in the Reghed Glacier. Ideally, the characters should be at least 8th level when they embark on this journey. Lower-level characters can survive the Caves of Hunger if they&rsquo;re cautious and rest often to regain their spent hit points and magic.</p>
<p>The characters must use the &ldquo;Rime of the Frostmaiden&rdquo; to open a crack in the glacial wall at a place where a waterfall once tumbled down the glacier. The newly formed passage leads to the Caves of Hunger, a dungeon that was sealed off by the Frostmaiden long agoâ€”a network of sepulchral ice caves haunted by ravenous beings. These chambers must be successfully navigated to reach the Netherese city of Ythryn.</p>

There&rsquo;s a good chance that Vellynne Harpell is present as well, serving as an NPC guide. If she died earlier in the adventure, the characters can use <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> as a substitute guide, assuming they retrieved Vellynne&rsquo;s <em>professor orb</em> from Auril&rsquo;s island in <strong>area chapter 5</strong>. If neither Vellynne nor Professor Skant are around, you can furnish another NPC with the information needed to reach the Caves of Hunger. Likely candidates include Hengar Aesnvaard (see &ldquo;Elk Tribe Escort&rdquo; below) and Dzaan&rsquo;s simulacrum (see appendix C).</p>

Thus, if they were 8th level at the start of this chapter, they will be 9th level when they enter Ythryn for the first time.</p>

Vellynne can be persuaded to delay the journey, but with each passing day, she becomes more agitated.</p>

If the characters are 8th level already, it&rsquo;s probably best to skip over the random encounters and proceed with the &ldquo;Elk and Tiger&rdquo; section below.</p>
<h3 id=elk-and-tiger>

One such person is Mjenir, a fifty-year-old shaman of the Reghed Elk Tribe, who received a vision about the characters' journey to the Reghed Glacier.</p>
<h4 id=elk-tribe-escort>
<a href=#elk-tribe-escort class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Elk Tribe Escort</h4><p>Several hours before the party reaches the glacier, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you crest another ridge, you spot a dozen humanoids approaching, their cloaks flapping in the wind sweeping down from the eastern glacier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The approaching figures are ten Tribal Warrior of the Elk Tribe, led by Mjenir (neutral human druid with <wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch> +4) and Hengar Aesnvaard (neutral good human gladiator with <wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch> +5). Mjenir waves at the characters to signal his peaceful intentions. If they are willing to speak, he directs them to a rocky alcove where both parties can enjoy a reprieve from the wind.</p>
<p>Mjenir proceeds to explain his vision and warns of grave danger ahead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Tigers with ice in their veins come to spill your blood upon the snow. They will do everything in their power to keep you from finding what the Frostmaiden has preserved under the ice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mjenir and his fellow Elk tribesfolk volunteer to escort the party to the foot of the Reghed Glacier. If the characters refuse that offer, the Elk tribesfolk return whence they came. Mjenir wishes them well and says, &ldquo;The fate of the dale rests upon your shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id=tiger-tribe-ambush>

<blockquote>
<p>The Reghed Glacier rises hundreds of feet into the sky. The foot of the glacier is still a half-mile away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, nearly two dozen figures burst out of the snow sixty feet away from you. They are spaced roughly ten feet apart and begin advancing in a line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who have a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 15 or higher are not surprised by the ambush, nor are members of the Elk Tribe who are traveling with the party.</p>
<h5 id=ambushers>
<a href=#ambushers class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Ambushers</h5><p>Mjenir was not the only one who foresaw the characters' path. The queen of the Tiger Tribe, Bjornhild Solvigsdottir (see <strong>area appendix C</strong>), has also been stirred to action. Bjornhild worships Auril and is furious that the party has decided to meddle in the Frostmaiden&rsquo;s affairs. If Bjornhild died earlier in the adventure, replace her with a frost druid (see appendix C) named Ajka.</p>
<p>If Bjornhild leads the ambush, she is joined by her pet saber-toothed tiger, Grava. If Ajka leads the ambush, give her a woolly rhinoceros companion. Twenty Tribal Warrior make up the rest of the ambushing force. Before closing to melee range, they hurl spears at the characters.</p>
<h5 id=elk-tribe-reaction>
<a href=#elk-tribe-reaction class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Elk Tribe Reaction</h5><p>If the characters allowed Mjenir, Hengar, and the other Elk tribesfolk to accompany them, the two leaders are confident in their ability to fight off the attackers while the characters race toward the glacier. If the characters let the Elk Tribe members fend off the Tigers, the outcome of the battle depends on whether Bjornhild leads the ambush:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Bjornhild leads the ambush, both she and Grava survive, as does Hengar. All three are reduced to half their hit points (rounded down). Everyone else is slain. Bjornhild takes Hengar prisoner and interprets the characters' escape as a sign that Auril intends to slay them herself; consequently, Bjornhild doesn&rsquo;t pursue them.</li>
<li>If Ajka leads the ambush, she and Hengar are the sole survivors with half their hit points remaining. After a brief standoff, Ajka polymorphs into a snowy owl and flees, leaving the wounded Hengar alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters who refuse to let the Elk Tribe fight this battle without them are attacked by Bjornhild and her saber-toothed tiger (or Ajka and her rhinoceros) while Hengar and his fellow Elk Tribe warriors clash with the rest of the attacking force. You can forgo making attack rolls for the tribal warriors; assume that they all act on the same initiative count and that one warrior from each tribe dies each round on that tribe&rsquo;s turn. Hengar kills an additional Tiger Tribe warrior on each of his turns. Mjenir stays out of melee and uses his <wc-fetch type=spell>produce flame</wc-fetch> cantrip to hurl fire at enemies.</p>
<h2 id=opening-the-way>
<a href=#opening-the-way class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Opening the Way</h2><p>When the characters reach the wall of the Reghed Glacier at the spot specified by Vellynne Harpell or Professor Skant, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An immense, glistening wall of blue ice stands before you. It seems impenetrable, but then you notice that a lighter-colored stripe nearly bisects the wall at one point. This must be the frozen waterfall Vellynne spoke of!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vellynne or <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> urges one of the characters to read aloud the &ldquo;Rime of the Frostmaiden&rdquo; (see appendix E). Reading the poem aloud while standing before the glacier has the following effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the last words of the poem are spoken, a rumbling sound comes from deep within the glacier. The noise reaches a crescendo as the great wall of ice parts. Through the crack, you can see an opening that leads inside the glacier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the way is open, the party is free to descend into the newly formed tunnel (<strong>area area H1</strong>).</p>

Auril then buried the city under the ice to preserve it, claiming it as her own.</p>
<p>The Caves of Hunger is a sprawling dungeon complex hollowed out of the Reghed Glacier. Some of its caves and tunnels formed naturally, some formed as a byproduct of Ythryn&rsquo;s fall, and still others are the work of creatures such as remorhazes that can dig or melt their way through solid ice. The fact that the entire complex is made of ice contributes to its alien atmosphere. The air is often stale, sound behaves strangely, and the tension of moving ever downward wears on the sanity of even the boldest adventurers.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Ceilings</b> Most cavern ceilings are 30 feet high and made of smooth ice. Tunnel ceilings range from 10 to 15 feet high unless otherwise noted.</li>
<li><b>Darkness</b> All areas are cast in complete darkness unless otherwise noted.</li>

All Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks to hear sounds in these caves have advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ice Slides</b> As remorhazes burrow through ice, the heat radiating from their bodies smooths out the sides of the tunnels behind them to a glass-like finish. Many of these passages are severely sloped, creating ice slides. Descending an ice slide is easy; climbing one is another matter. A character needs crampons or other climbing gear to ascend one of these slippery passages.</li>

<p>When they cracked open the Reghed Glacier, the characters unsealed the glacial prison holding Tekeli-li. After decades of captivity and starvation, the vampire is once again free to leave the caves and haunt Icewind Dale. First, however, it plans to feed. The vampire is the only wandering monster that the characters encounter in the Caves of Hunger, and they are likely to encounter it more than once as they descend deeper into the caves.</p>
<p>Vellynne Harpell&rsquo;s <em>professor orb</em>, <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch>, is an expert on vampires and vampirism. Once it becomes aware of Tekeli-li, the <em>professor orb</em> shares the vampire&rsquo;s known weaknesses with the characters.</p>
<p>The party should meet Tekeli-li several times. The vampire&rsquo;s strategy is to drain the party&rsquo;s resources, then retreat and recover before attacking again. If Tekeli-li ever takes more than 20 damage during an encounter, the vampire turns to mist and withdraws to a safe location in the dungeon. Even when the vampire is not immediately present, its cackling laughter echoes through the caves sporadically.</p>
<p>You can stage an encounter with Tekeli-li anywhere you like. If you&rsquo;re not sure where it might be or how it should behave, roll a <wc-roll>d6</wc-roll> and consult the Tekeli-li&rsquo;s Location table. The table determines where the vampire is first encountered. If the vampire withdraws, roll again on the table to determine where it goes (roll again if the result indicates no change in its location).</p>
<p>If the characters have not encountered the vampire by the time they reach <strong>area area H36</strong>, it attacks them there.</p>

<p>You come to a thirty-foot-high cavern. In its center, the remains of a wooden ship hull rest on the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> is allowed to view the wreckage, the <em>professor orb</em> offers the following commentary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, a Netherese skycoach! I&rsquo;ve always wanted to ride on one of those. Pity it&rsquo;s no longer in one piece.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ship is all that remains of a Netherese skycoach, an airship that was used to ferry people to and from the floating city of Ythryn. Any loud disturbances in this cave cause the four Flameskull in area H3 to cackle madly as they make their way to this cavern. The flameskulls are the animated, fire-wreathed skulls of Netherese wizards transformed into guardians by the will of the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>The tunnel that leads to <strong>area area H5</strong> has a slippery, 20-foot-tall drop-off that characters can descend safely with a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. On a failed check, a character slips and lands <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>, taking damage from the fall as normal.</p>

<p>The creature is a kobold vampire spawn (see <strong>area appendix C</strong>) created by Tekeli-li. <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> recognizes the creature as a vampire and knows its weaknesses.

<p>Sparkling icicles as long as longswords cling to the forty-foot-high roof of this cavern, the floor of which is strewn with frost-covered blocks of stone and a toppled pillar. Embedded in the east wall is a glittering stone tower that appears to have crashed through the ceiling long ago. The exposed wall is cracked and has a few small holes in it but is otherwise intact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> is allowed to view the tower, the <em>professor orb</em> offers the following commentary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That tower appears to be of Netherese construction. Were it not for the cracks and holes, the stone would be smooth as glass, shaped by wizardly magic!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seven Ice Mephit created by Auril cling to the ceiling, their wings wrapped tightly around their bodies so that they are easily mistaken for icicles. Characters who have passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) scores of 13 or higher can distinguish the mephits from the scores of real icicles that festoon the ceiling.</p>
<p>The ice mephits are tasked with guarding the cave but do not enter melee combat willingly. An ice mephit&rsquo;s preferred tactic is to use its action to fly next to an icicle and break it off, causing it to fall on an enemy below. Any creature standing under a falling icicle must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) piercing damage from it.</p>

<p>If <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> is allowed to view the interior, the <em>professor orb</em> offers the following commentary:</p>

<p>A character who examines the shifting geometric patterns can, with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check, come to the same conclusion as Professor Skant.</p>
<p>The characters can punch a hole in the tower&rsquo;s outer wall that&rsquo;s big enough for them to crawl or walk through. Any character who takes a short rest in the tower regains one spell slot of 3rd level or lower at the end of that rest. A character can&rsquo;t gain this benefit again for 24 hours.</p>

Arcane Eye Activator</h4><blockquote>
<p>A flat, slightly canted slab of stone rests in the center of this twenty-foot-high cave. One side is rough, as if the slab had been torn from a larger structure. The slab is eight feet long, four feet wide, four feet high, and covered with frost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scraping off the frost on the slab reveals Draconic script etched into its top, with an open eye carved above it. Close examination reveals that the pupil of the eye is a stone button that can be pressed. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the slab.</p>
<p>If <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> sees the script, the <em>professor orb</em> informs the characters that the Netherese used the Draconic script (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Loross: The Netherese Tongue</strong>&rdquo; sidebar). If the characters don&rsquo;t know Draconic, Professor Skant can translate the script for them. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Take the free, self-guided tour of Ythryn. Press the eye to cast the spell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A character can use an action to press the eye, thereby using the slab to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane eye</wc-fetch> spell. The spell lasts for 1 hour or until the character&rsquo;s concentration on the spell ends. The slab, which used to function whenever the button was pressed, is damaged. Once the spell is cast, the slab ceases to be magical.</p>

Golem Head</h4><blockquote>
<p>Lying on its side in the middle of this twenty-foot-high cave is an enormous head made of iron, its eyes aglow with a golden light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iron golems were used as sentries throughout Ythryn. This head is all that remains of a golem that was decapitated when the city crashed. It has been separated from the city and its body ever since. The potent magic used in the golem&rsquo;s construction has kept the head functional.</p>
<p>The head can&rsquo;t attack or use its Poison Breath in this state, nor can it speak. It can communicate by blinking the lights in its eyesâ€”one blink for no, two blinks for yes, three blinks for &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; It understands Elvish and Loross (see the &ldquo;Loross: The Netherese Tongue&rdquo; sidebar). If the characters know none of these languages, Professor Skant can communicate with the golem in Loross on their behalf.</p>
<p>Here are examples of the questions the party might ask, and the golem&rsquo;s responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Do you know where Ythryn is?&rdquo; (No.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Were you damaged when the city fell?&rdquo; (Yes.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is there danger ahead?&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t know.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Have other creatures passed through this cave recently?&rdquo; (Yes. The golem is referring to the kobold vampire spawn that lair in the caves to the east.)</li>

<p>Terrible psychic trauma lingers in this cave, causing any creature that enters it to feel intensely hungry, even after leaving the cave. Eating a handful of food keeps the creature&rsquo;s hunger at bay for 1 hour. If its hunger isn&rsquo;t satisfied within 1 minute, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>. The saving throw must be repeated every hour until the creature succeeds or dies, or until the effect is ended on that creature by magic that can remove a curse. A creature that doesn&rsquo;t require food automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the effect ends on a creature, it becomes immune to the cave&rsquo;s psychic trauma.

<p>Crammed into this cave are twenty 3-foot-tall ice sculptures that the kobold vampire spawn have made to startle and frighten intruders.

<p>Each ice sculpture is a Small object that weighs roughly 40 pounds and has AC 13, 5 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. Smashing any of the sculptures alerts the kobold vampire spawn in <strong>area area H17</strong>.</p>

Drakareth&rsquo;s Doom</h4><p>This location consists of multiple areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>An empty cave to the northeast has a 20-foot-high domed ceiling, naturally formed stairs leading up to <strong>area area H11</strong>, and a narrow tunnel leading east toward areas <strong>area H16</strong> and <strong>area H22</strong>.</li>
<li>A cave to the southwest has an uneven ceiling that ranges in height from 15 to 30 feet. A wraith named Drakareth haunts this cave, northwest of which are three cysts blocked off by thick walls of ice. The northernmost cyst contains Drakareth&rsquo;s earthly remains and treasure (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</li>
</ul>
<p>When one or more characters enter the wraith&rsquo;s cave, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A deep sigh issues from the darkness. A voice steeped in malevolence and hatred whispers to you in a language reminiscent of Elvish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wraith speaks Loross (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Loross: The Netherese Tongue</strong>&rdquo; sidebar), which <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> can translate if necessary. Its words are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cursed be those who gaze upon the horror that Drakareth has become. Such promise wasted, lost in this cold sepulcher! Where were you centuries years ago when he was in the prime of life? Where were you when the frigid darkness consumed him? You are no good to Drakareth now! Nothing remains of him but frozen bones, ancient treasures, and me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drakareth was a Netherese mage who survived the fall of Ythryn, murdered his wounded rivals, and stole their spellbooks and magic items. He had hoped to escape with his newfound treasures but perished from <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> and cold, rising as a wraith. The wraith seeks the destruction of all who enter its chamber. If successfully turned or reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, the wraith retreats to the icy cyst that contains Drakareth&rsquo;s frozen remains, passing through the interposing walls of ice to reach it. There, it fights to the bitter end.</p>
<p>The walls of ice that separate the smaller cysts from the larger cave are thick enough to be opaque, but characters can break through them. Each 5-foot-square, 1-foot-thick section of wall has AC 13, 18 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.</p>

When you are 9 feet tall, your Strength becomes 19 unless it is already higher. For every 3 additional feet of height you gain, your Strength increases by 1, to a maximum of 23. Armor and clothing you are wearing and weapons you are carrying magically increase in size to match your growth. If you are the recipient of a <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic, this charm vanishes from you, and you immediately shrink back to normal size, along with any armor, clothing, and weapons in your possession.</p>

Thing in the Ice</h4><blockquote>
<p>A flat sheet of cloudy ice forms one wall of this forty-foot-high cavern. Something dark and humungous shifts behind the wall, its tentacles waving unimpeded. You become aware you are not alone inside your mind. Somehow, this horror from another world has wormed its way inside you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something beyond mortal comprehension exists partially inside the wall of ice and partially within some distant, horrific demiplane. As this otherworldly entity peers into the cavern, visitors risk losing their sanity to its influence.</p>
<p>Any creature that comes within 20 feet of the wall of ice is targeted by a <wc-fetch type=spell>dominate monster</wc-fetch> spell (save DC 15). The entity can concentrate on up to ten such spells at once. Any creature that successfully saves against the spell resists it and can&rsquo;t be targeted by this effect again. On a failed save, the creature stands perfectly still and does nothing while the alien entity probes its mind for 1 hour. If a creature remains under the spell&rsquo;s effect for the full duration, it must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw at the end of the hour, taking 44 (<wc-roll>8d10</wc-roll>) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Whether the save succeeds or fails, a creature subjected to the hour-long probe also gains a randomly determined form of long-term madness, determined by rolling on the long-term madness in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.</p>
<p>The ice wall has AC 13, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. If the wall takes 50 points of damage or more, large cracks form along its surface, and the alien entity withdraws into its distant demiplane, never to return. As it withdraws, its <wc-fetch type=spell>dominate monster</wc-fetch> spells end.</p>

<p>Every surface of this twenty-foot-high cave is polished to a mirror finish, such that you are faced with countless distorted reflections of yourself. Your head spins as you try to keep your bearings.</p>

<p>If Tekeli-li is here, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crouching in the middle of the cavern is a gaunt gnoll with ravenous eyes and the foul stench of the grave coming from it. The creature does not cast a reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ranged attack rolls made in this cave have disadvantage because of the disorienting reflections. If Tekeli-li is here, the gnoll vampire (see appendix C) uses its Frightful Cackle first, then targets enemies with its Sickening Gaze until one or more them closes to melee range. See the &ldquo;<strong>area Tekeli-li</strong>&rdquo; section earlier in this chapter for more of Tekeli-li&rsquo;s tactics.</p>

<p>This fifteen-foot-high, U-shaped cavern appears empty at first glance, but a sudden tapping draws your attention to the west wall, within which is trapped a black-robed figure with a golden visage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A mummy dressed in a tattered black robe and wearing a golden face mask is trapped in the western wall and has no way to free itself from the ice. The mummy was created by Netherese priests to serve as a lore-keeper in Ythryn.</p>
<p>The section of ice that traps the mummy has AC 13, 22 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. If the wall is reduced to 0 hit points, the mummy is released and makes its way to <strong>area area H39</strong> and from there to the library in Ythryn (<strong>area area Y9</strong> in chapter 7).

<blockquote>
<p>Large pieces of stone jut from the twenty-foot-high ceiling of this empty cavern.</p>

<p>The stone fragments are pieces of Ythryn that settled in the ice. Any character who examines the stone and makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check to discern its true nature. (A dwarf&rsquo;s Stonecunning trait can prove helpful here.) If the check succeeds, the character can confirm that the stone is neither naturally formed nor hewn, but rather shaped by magic.</p>

Frozen Grove</h4><p>If the characters make it this far and haven&rsquo;t yet faced Tekeli-li, the gnoll vampire (see appendix C) confronts them here in its Large hyena form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A grove of frost-covered trees fills this fifty-foot-high cavern, the floor of which is a mixture of earth and ice. By some magic or miracle, the trees are alive, their canopies thick with frosty leaves, their branches bearing purple pears that hang like ornaments. A low wall, broken in several places, threads its way through the grove, which is surrounded by six exits.</p>

</span></p>
<p>This grove of pear trees was enchanted by Netherese arcanists to endure high altitude and harsh weather. That magic has enabled the trees to thrive even in these icy caverns. Essential to the grove&rsquo;s survival is a dryad named Hathowyn, who resides in the southernmost tree. If the dryad dies, the trees die <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> days later. Centuries of isolation have made Hathowyn lonely, and the dryad hungers for conversation and companionship.</p>
<p>If Tekeli-li is present, Hathowyn remains hidden in her tree until the gnoll vampire leaves or is destroyed. Tekeli-li has never seen the dryad and is unaware of her presence. If given the chance, Hathowyn tries to engage the characters in conversation, speaking Elvish or Sylvan. She hopes to keep them in the grove for as long as possible. If the characters try to leave, Hathowyn tries to charm one of them into staying and keeping her company. The dryad knows the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Netherese magic binds the dryad to the grove and keeps the trees alive.</li>
<li>The pears hanging from the trees are magically delicious.</li>
<li>Three dark elves have passed through the dryad&rsquo;s grove on multiple occasions, coming and going through the southwest and southeast passages (leading to areas <strong>area H29</strong> and <strong>area H39</strong>). Hathowyn hasn&rsquo;t spoken to them out of fear that they might harm her.</li>
<li>Strange, one-eyed creatures lurk in the cave to the south (<strong>area area H37</strong>). They followed the dark elves up from below after their last foray down the southeast passage.</li>

Weird Insights</h4><blockquote>
<p>Huddled together at the west end of this ten-foot-high cave are four hunched creatures with spiny backs and sharp claws. Each one stares at you with a single unblinking eye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These four Nothic, evil denizens of Ythryn, followed Yilsebek and his fellow drow as far as the dryad&rsquo;s grove (area H36) before taking refuge in this cave. The nothics use their Weird Insight to glean secrets from the characters. They are reluctant to provoke a well-armed group of adventurers, preferring to pick off lone prey, but if attacked, they respond in kind.</p>
<p>Offering food and drink to the nothics loosens their tongues, but these ones speak and understand only Loross (see the <strong>area &ldquo;Loross: The Netherese Tongue</strong>"). They can also write in the Draconic script. <wc-fetch type=item>Professor Skant</wc-fetch> can serve as a translator if none of the characters can understand the nothics.</p>
<p>The nothics have no memory of their lost humanity, and any information they might provide is garbled with bits of nonsense. Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check can glean the following information from the nothics after a brief conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iriolarthas, a powerful Netherese archwizard, watches over Ythryn. He has lost not only his mind, but most of his body as well. All that remains of him is a floating human skull.</li>
<li>Giant floating hands made of magical force wander around in the city.</li>
<li>Ythryn&rsquo;s <em>mythallar</em> won&rsquo;t function properly as long as the Spindleâ€”a powerful artifact dating back 40,000 yearsâ€”remains in the city. The artifact is located within the city&rsquo;s central spire.</li>
<li>One must perform a ritual to enter Ythryn&rsquo;s central spire. (The nothics don&rsquo;t remember how the ritual works, but they do recall that clues can be found in the towers of wizardry scattered throughout the city.)</li>
<li>Somewhere in Ythryn is a scroll that can summon the tarrasque.</li>
