To the northeast, a river snakes down from the foothills of the Peaks of Flame and flushes into the city through a canyon (see <strong>area 17</strong>). The second access point is a staircase to the southwest (see <strong>area 1</strong>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The jungle parts to reveal a dead city enclosed by sheer cliffs. Ruined buildings and stone boulevards rise like ghosts from the floor of the misty basin. Colorful birds glide overhead.</p>
<p>A waterfall pours into the basin, creating a swollen river that floods much of the city before draining into a deep rift filled with molten lava. A ruined palace lies a few hundred feet from the edge of the steaming abyss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cliffs surrounding Omu are 100-150 feet high and composed of crumbling rock. Thick jungle hugs the clifftops, with ferns, orchids, and moss spilling over the edges. Every 100 feet or so, a gargoyle perches on the brink of the precipice. When a character gets a good look at one of these creatures, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vine-draped gargoyle perches on the clifftop, staring down at the ruined city. It has the face of a devil, with its mouth agape in a silent scream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gargoyles attack anyone who flies over the city or tries to climb up or down the cliffs, but they ignore intruders who enter by the river or the ravine to the southwest. They serve Acererak and take orders from his undead tomb custodian, Withers (see chapter 5).</p>

Built over rich mineral veins, the city garnered wealth in abundance. Omuan jewelry was coveted far and wide, and the city&rsquo;s merchants grew fat on commerce. To enter Omu, it was said, was to enter the gates of paradise itself. Such wealth brought greed. Omu&rsquo;s hunger for slaves made her rulers demand ever greater tribute from their neighbors. When their vassals couldn&rsquo;t pay in flesh, they paid in blood. Omu&rsquo;s feared legions marched across Chult.</p>
<p>The Omuans' greed and hubris angered the god Ubtao, causing him to turn his back on Omu two hundred years ago-long before he abandoned the rest of Chult. Omu&rsquo;s clerics lost their spells, and the city fell to sickness and disease. Slave uprisings wracked Omu, and its nobles fled in droves. Maps showing Omu&rsquo;s location were destroyed, and its coins were melted down and reminted. Fallen from grace, Omu became known as the Forbidden City.</p>

They disguised themselves as jungle creatures and promised great power in return for devotion. Desperate for redemption, the Omuans tore down their temple to Ubtao and raised shrines to these nine trickster gods.</p>
<p>The new deities were divisive and often cruel. Too weak to grant miracles to every follower, they concocted elaborate trials to winnow the clergy. On holy days, the mettle of aspirant priests was tested in their nine shrines, with deadly consequences for failure. The trials provided entertainment for the degenerate Omuans and fed their weakling gods with much-needed sacrifices.</p>
<p>For nine decades, the city folk lived by the mantras of their trickster gods. They built statues in their names and schemed against each other to assert their chosen god&rsquo;s dominance. Omu&rsquo;s glorious past was lost, but its people endured. Such mercy did not last long.</p>

Acererak, who is fond of deathtraps, marveled at the trials concocted by the Omuans. They inspired him to create his own dungeon below the city.</p>
<p>A little over a century ago, Acererak entered Omu and slew all nine trickster gods. He then enslaved the Omuans and forced them to carve out a tomb for their defeated gods. When the tomb was complete, Acererak murdered the Omuans and sealed them in the tomb with their false gods. The archlich resumed his odyssey across the planes, content that the dungeon would feed his phylactery with the souls of dead adventurers. The jungle reclaimed Omu, and it fell into ruin.</p>

They built an underground temple beneath the old palace and patiently waited for their god, Dendar the Night Serpent, to come forth and swallow the world. Earthquakes shook Omu and cracked it open like a fig, causing the river to burst its banks. Chance spared the yuan-ti temple from destruction, but scores of yuan-ti died, including their leader (a yuan-ti abomination).</p>
<p>The evil warlord Ras Nsi, who had raised an army of undead to wage war on the holy city of Mezro, only to suffer a terrible defeat, arrived in Omu shortly after the yuan-ti. Ras Nsi wormed his way into the yuan-ti&rsquo;s favor and underwent a ritual to transform into a malison. Before long, he became their ruler. Today, beneath the cracked and broken streets of Omu, Ras Nsi holds sway and plots to bring Dendar the Night Serpent into the world, sealing its doom.</p>

A character with the cloistered scholar or sage background can translate an inscription written in Old Omuan with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check, while a warlock with the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation can translate Old Omuan script without a check. If the characters recover the &ldquo;queen&rsquo;s decree&rdquo; from the chwinga cart at <strong>area 11</strong>, they can use it to decode inscriptions written in Old Omuan. Without the queen&rsquo;s decree or a character with the appropriate background, the characters can translate Old Omuan writing only by using a <wc-fetch type=spell>comprehend languages</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>

As characters explore the gods' shrines, the players piece together fragments of the following legend, which provides clues on how to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.</p>
<p>Long ago, the god Ubtao hardened his heart and vowed to weep for the people of Omu no longer. The rains stopped, the jungle withered and died, and death swept through Omu.</p>
<p>One morning, a wise zorbo emerged from her hollow tree and spoke to the dying Omuans. To convince Ubtao of their worth, she decided to cook him a stew made from all their good qualities. Catching such virtues wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, so she asked a wily almiraj to help her. The almiraj snuck recklessness in the pot, which she saw as a virtue, and Ubtao spat out the stew when he tasted it. From that day on, Obo&rsquo;laka the zorbo and I&rsquo;jin the almiraj became terrible enemies.</p>
<p>At noon, a brave kamadan hopped down from her rock. She saw the evil in the Omuans' hearts and decided to lance it like a troublesome boil. The kamadan fashioned a holy spear, but she left it by the riverbank and a crafty grung stole it. In her rage, Shagambi the kamadan forgot all about the Omuans and chased Nangnang the grung forever across the sky.</p>
<p>When evening came, a wily eblis stepped from his reed hut. He didn&rsquo;t like the Omuans, but without them he&rsquo;d have no one to play his tricks on. The eblis sent a marsh frog to reason with Ubtao, but the frog was angry and decided to wrestle the god instead. This amused Ubtao, so he gave the frog tentacles to make it stronger. When Kubazan the froghemoth returned to Papazotl the eblis, he chased Papazotl into the swamp with his new tentacles.</p>
<p>That night, a su-monster broke into Ubtao&rsquo;s palace and stole a pail of water for the Omuans. When the god came running to find it, the su-monster hid the pail in a jaculi&rsquo;s burrow. Ubtao asked the jungle animals where his water was hidden, and Moa the jaculi was too honest to lie. When Wongo the su-monster found out how Moa had betrayed him, he vowed to catch the jaculi and eat him up.</p>
<p>All the while, Unkh the flail snail lived deep under the earth. The noise of the other animals fighting made her slither up to the surface, and when day dawned over her shell, the light blinded Ubtao and made his eyes water. Life returned to Omu, and the people built shrines to honor the animals who&rsquo;d saved them.</p>

Explorers also come here in search of gold and glory. Presently, these include Red Wizards and three tabaxi hunters. Each of these groups can play as much of a role in the story as you desire.

If Salida escorts the characters into the city, she&rsquo;ll surreptitiously use her sending stone to contact Ras Nsi so that he can prepare an ambush. When night falls, Salida uses a lantern to signal the yuan-ti attack. The attacking force consists of one type 3 yuan-ti malison (type 1) and two yuan-ti pureblood per party member. Ras Nsi is keen to capture the characters so he can question them about their mission.</p>

Stardust rained over the ruins and formed patches of russet mold out of which vegepygmies arose. Their tribes prowl the flooded backstreets. Yuan-ti have learned to shun these areas and kill the &ldquo;moldies&rdquo; on sight.</p>
<p>Omu contains several small tribes of vegepygmies. They clash over territory and are unified only in their reverence of the Great Rift. Even if the vegepygmies could communicate with the characters, they have little desire to work with them. Their chiefs aren&rsquo;t clever, and the characters could trick the vegepygmies to unify against a common enemy.</p>

To maintain the shrines' traps, Acererak recruited a tribe of kobolds to act as shrine menders. These creatures dwell in cellars beneath a ruined marketplace (<strong>area 15</strong>). Acererak has promised to transform their sorcerer, Kakarol, into a dragon if the kobolds keep their end of their bargain. Too impatient to wait for his ascension, Kakarol has taken to sleeping on a small hoard of treasure and insists his underlings address him as Great Wyrm. If the characters cut a deal with the kobolds, the sorcerer&rsquo;s greed is easily manipulated.</p>
<p>Acererak hasn&rsquo;t told the kobolds about his alliance with Ras Nsi. For their part, the yuan-ti are barely aware of the kobolds' existence.</p>

They camped in the ruined compound at <strong>area 2</strong>, but Ras Nsi&rsquo;s forces nearly wiped them out in a night raid. Those who survived the attack continue to search the ruins for the Soulmonger.</p>
<p>The survivors include four Red Wizards (LE male and female Thayan human mage) named Dyrax (male), Thazma (female), Yamoch (male), and Zagmira (female). Their red robes, shaved heads, and sallow complexions betray their allegiance to Thay. Eight mercenaries (LE male and female human thug of various ethnicities) escort the wizards. The highest ranking mage, Zagmira, appears just eighteen years old, yet one half of her face is wizened and old. This effect is a holdover from a terrible ritual she performed to inhabit the body of her own granddaughter. All four mages carry spellbooks that contain all their prepared spells.</p>
<p>Zagmira has seen the entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods (<strong>area 14</strong>) and believes the Soulmonger is held within. The Red Wizards have separated to find the puzzle cubes needed to unlock the tomb (see <em>&ldquo;Puzzle Cubes&rdquo;</em>.)</p>
<p>A man named Orvex (see <strong>area 2</strong>) serves the Red Wizards as a scribe and translator, but his loyalty to them is tenuous. The adventurers can easily befriend him.</p>

A divine being known as the Cat Lord leads the bravest to Omu, where they spend their final days hunting dinosaurs and other jungle beasts.</p>
<p>Three elderly tabaxi hunter stalk the city when the characters arrive. Their names are Hooded Lantern (male), Bag of Nails (male), and Copper Bell (female). The hunters know the city well, but care little for its history and keep clear of its shrines. They hunt alone and avoid contact with explorers. Rare weapons and hunting gear are the only items the characters could offer to gain their help.</p>
<p>Hooded Lantern has graying black fur, and cataracts cloud his left eye. He is preparing himself for a glorious death fighting the great tyrannosaurus rex known as the King of Feathers (see <strong>area 13</strong>). Copper Bell has speckled ginger fur and wears a torn blue cloth over her bony shoulders-the blanket used to comfort her cubs when they were infants. She retains much of her inquisitiveness and wry humor. Bag of Nails has gone mad and is described in <strong>area 7</strong>.</p>

The Red Wizards are already searching for the cubes, and Ras Nsi does what he must to prevent the Red Wizards or the characters from obtaining all of them.</p>
<p>A puzzle cube is a stone cube 3 inches on a side and engraved with images of a specific trickster god. Each cube weighs half a pound. A detect magic spell or similar effect reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each cube.</p>

</p>
<p>The puzzle cubes can&rsquo;t be destroyed by any means. If they&rsquo;re discarded, buried, or taken more than a mile outside Omu, they teleport back to their resting places inside their respective shrines. If the characters return to a previously cleared shrine, there&rsquo;s a cumulative 20 percent chance per day that kobolds have reset its traps.</p>

The Red Wizards find at least two of the puzzle cubes, and Ras Nsi always steps in to claim the final cube. Things play out differently if the players find a way to foil their enemies' plans-by killing them, for example.</p>
<p>On the day the characters claim their first puzzle cube, the Red Wizards clear a separate shrine within the city. While the Red Wizards remain active, there&rsquo;s a cumulative 25 percent chance per day that they claim another puzzle cube from a random shrine. If the players arrive at a cleared shrine, they discover a scene of devastation: traps sprung, monsters slain, and the cube missing.</p>
<p>Once five puzzle cubes have been taken from their shrines, Ras Nsi begins to set ambushes. When the characters arrive at their next shrine, three type 1 yuan-ti malison (type 1) and six yuan-ti pureblood ambush them. Their orders are to capture characters and bring them to the Fane of the Night Serpent for interrogation.</p>
<p>Once eight puzzle cubes have been claimed, Ras Nsi steals the ninth cube for himself and leaves an obvious trail leading pursuers to the main entrance of his underground temple (see <strong>area 20A</strong>). The characters must infiltrate the temple and either take the puzzle cube by force or convince Ras Nsi to part with it. For more information on the temple and its inhabitants, see chapter 4.</p>

If an accord is reached, Zagmira reveals that she has a spy in the yuan-ti temple: a yuan-ti pureblood named Ishmakahl (pronounced ISH-mah-kawl). Zagmira doesn&rsquo;t reveal that this spy is a doppelganger.</p>
<p>Zagmira encourages human characters to infiltrate the yuan-ti temple disguised as purebloods, with nonhuman characters posing as their slaves. If no human characters are present, Zagmira is willing to spend a 5th-level spell slot to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>invisibility</wc-fetch> on up to four party members. If the characters recover the puzzle cube taken by Ras Nsi, the Red Wizards turn against the characters and try to claim all the puzzle cubes for themselves once the characters emerge from the yuan-ti temple. If Artus Cimber is with the party, the Red Wizards also try to take the <wc-fetch type=item>Ring of Winter</wc-fetch> from him.</p>
<p>If the Red Wizards obtain all nine puzzle cubes, they use them to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods and, one by one, fall prey to the tomb&rsquo;s insidious traps.</p>

Buildings in Omu are shaped from limestone. Thick, broad-leaved vines engulf most structures, while ferns and thorny bushes choke the streets. Statues representing the trickster gods leer from many junctions.</p>
<p>Cautious characters can move through the city at a rate of 200 feet every 5 minutes. Even if they throw caution to the wind, the density of the undergrowth makes it tricky to move faster than 200 feet per minute. If the characters stop to search for treasure, each building takes 30 minutes to clear. Whenever the party searches a ruined building, roll percentile dice and consult the Ruin Interior table to see what, if anything, the building contains.</p>

City Entrance</h3><blockquote>
<p>A guardhouse stands near the entrance to the city. Arrow slits are cut into its limestone walls, and a lopsided iron portcullis hangs over the gateway, beyond which you see an open plaza.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters enter the guardhouse, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the interior has collapsed into rubble. Creepers cling to the walls, and high grasses sprout between the flagstones amid evidence of long-dead campfires. One wall is covered with graffiti-some words painted, others etched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The graffiti (written in Common) provides hints about the challenges that await:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fear the fangs of Ras Nsi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erik, I&rsquo;ve gone in search of the nine shrines. V.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The puzzle cubes are the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware the frog monster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Unkh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hail the King of Feathers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snakes are not what they seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kubazan = bravery. Shagambi = wisdom. Moa = ?&rdquo;</p>

A narrow goat track zigzags up the cliff to their hideout.</p>
<p>The group consists of two type 1 malisons, two type 2 malisons, and one type 3 malison. They follow the characters into Omu and shadow them through the streets. Their goal is to ambush the characters and capture at least one of them. If they remain out of sight, the yuan-ti launch their attack when the characters try to take their first long or short rest in the city.</p>

Walled Compound</h3><blockquote>
<p>Smoke drifts lazily from a walled compound. The gate lies in splinters, and scorch marks deface the buildings. Near the center of the compound is a plaza littered with charred human corpses. One of the corpses is being torn apart by a pack of wild dogs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Red Wizards seized this compound as their base of operations in Omu, but yuan-ti attacked and nearly wiped them out. Thirty corpses are scattered across the compound-the remains of three Red Wizards, twenty human mercenaries, and seven bearers hired in Port Nyanzaru. The yuan-ti looted all the supplies they found and stole their enemies' weapons. Six wild dogs (use jackal statistics) feed on one of the Red Wizards. The dogs pose no threat if the characters keep their distance.</p>

Characters who explore the compound discover this effigy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A glaive has been thrust into remains of a burned-out pyre. Charred snake skulls and blackened inhuman vertebrae are lashed to the spear. On a wall nearby, a symbol has been daubed in ash: a snake curled in a spiral, gripping a circle in its jaws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check, a character recognizes the sigil on the wall as the symbol of Dendar the Night Serpent devouring the world.</p>
<h4 id=orvex-ocrammas>

Orvex is dying of thirst and <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>. As characters search the compound, they hear him calling out for help from under the rubble. If the characters free Orvex, he begs to join their band until he finds sanctuary.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/timbomckay/image/upload/f_auto/adventure/toa/orvex%20ocrammas.jpg alt="Orvex Ocrammas" class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span>
</p>
<p>Orvex serves as scribe and translator for the Red Wizards. He&rsquo;s a pragmatic, balding human in his early forties who serves the Red Wizards because, as he puts it, they pay well. Orvex has the statistics of a spy, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orvex is neutral.</li>
<li>He has 3 hit points remaining and 3 levels of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> (see appendix A of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook for <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> effects).</li>
<li>He speaks Common and Grung.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters befriend Orvex, he can help them forge a truce with any surviving Red Wizards. Orvex can translate Old Omuan, and his studies of Omu&rsquo;s carvings taught him the legend of the nine trickster gods (see <em>&ldquo;Legend of the Nine Gods,"</em>) which Orvex is happy to recount once he&rsquo;s fully healed and rested.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious risks, Orvex looks forward to exploring more of the city and unlocking its secrets. If he&rsquo;s still with the characters when they retrieve all nine puzzle cubes, he jumps at the chance to accompany them on their descent into the Tomb of the Nine Gods.</p>

<p>A rectangular pool of murky water stretches before this vine-draped shrine. Rope bridges that once spanned the water float on the surface, tangled with other debris. The shards of a toppled monolith form stepping stones to the middle of the pool, where a statue of a stone frog rises above the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shrine to the trickster god Kubazan (represented as a froghemoth) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.</p>

The froghemoth attacks anyone who disturbs the water or tries to reach the shrine, heaving itself from the pool to pursue prey.</p>
<p>The shattered monolith is slippery with moss, and the rotted rope bridges sink as soon as anyone steps on them. Any character who jumps across the stepping stones must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to keep from falling in the pool.</p>

Locked Gate</h3><p>Carved into the lintel above this locked gate is an inscription written in Old Omuan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Kubazan urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A character who heeds the words gains some insight into the trial that awaits in <strong>area 3C</strong>.</p>
<p>To pick the lock, a character with thieves' tools must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity check. Whether the check succeeds or fails, a <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch> spell targets the character with a fear spell (save DC 15). The glyph doesn&rsquo;t trigger if the door is unlocked using the stone key from the froghemoth pool (<strong>area 3A</strong>).</p>

Chamber of Bravery</h3><blockquote>
<p>Steps descend to a ledge overlooking a pit of sharpened stakes. An alcove on the far wall holds a pedestal with a stone cube resting on it. A relief carved into the back of the alcove shows a monstrous frog with tentacles fighting a crane. Wooden beams radiate from the walls at floor height, with four-foot gaps between them. Carved frog heads extrude from the walls above the beams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wall relief shows Kubazan (a froghemoth) fighting Papazotl (an eblis). An inscription written in Old Omuan tells how Kubazan earned his tentacles from the god Ubtao (see <em>&ldquo;Legend of the Nine Gods,"</em>).</p>

A creature that falls into the pit takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall and must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

To hop onto a beam without falling, a creature must succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, the DC of which is 5 + the distance (in feet) between the two beams. When weight is applied to and lifted from a beam, it retracts and becomes flush with the wall, preventing it from being used again. The beams reset to their original positions after all of them have retracted into the walls.</p>

Checks made to pick the gate lock from within the shrine have disadvantage. At the same time, the carved frog heads on the walls open their mouths, belch forth enough poisonous gas to fill the shrine, and then close their mouths. Placing an object of equal weight to the puzzle cube (half a pound) on the pedestal prevents the gate closure and the release of gas.</p>
<p>The gas fills the shrine for 1 minute, then dissipates. Any creature that starts its turn inside the shrine while the gas is present must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don&rsquo;t need to breathe.</p>

</p>
<p>The shrine to the trickster god Shagambi (represented as a kamadan) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.</p>
<p>Two mated kamadan use a cart at the back of the shrine as their lair. If they hear intruders approaching the shrine, the kamadans try to ambush them. The kamadans fight tooth and claw to protect their three young cubs. Kamadan cubs are noncombatants that look like baby leopards and grow to adult size within a year. The cubs' snakes won&rsquo;t sprout from their shoulders for another 6 months. Characters can capture the cubs and spend months trying to domesticate them, but the kamadans turn on their would-be masters once they reach adulthood in a year.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Reliefs on the monoliths show Shagambi overseeing Chultan warriors as they train with spears and swords.</p>
<p>The door to the shrine is not locked, but it hangs heavy on its hinges. It weighs 600 pounds, so one or more characters must have a combined Strength score of 20 or higher to push it open.</p>

Arena Gallery</h3><p>When one or more characters enter the shrine, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steps descend into a fifteen-foot-high, moss-covered room. Four statues of Omuan warriors stand in alcoves to either side, overlooking a barred gladiatorial pit in the floor. Each statue looks like it was meant to hold a spear, but its weapon is missing. On the far side of the chamber, a stone pedestal stands conspicuously bare. A relief on the wall behind it shows a monstrous jaguar with six snakes protruding from its shoulders, fighting off a squat, frog-like humanoid armed with a spear. To the left of the relief is a narrow tunnel with stairs leading down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statues can&rsquo;t be moved from their alcoves, and they are impervious to damage and spells. The tunnel in the north wall slopes down to the bottom of the gladiatorial pit (<strong>area 4D</strong>) and leads to a cellblock beyond (<strong>area 4C</strong>).</p>
<p>The wall relief depicts Shagambi (a kamadan) fighting Nangnang (a grung). Just below, an inscription written in Old Omuan tells the story of how Nangnang stole Shagambi&rsquo;s spear (see <em>&ldquo;Legend of the Nine Gods&rdquo;</em>). With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices tiny holes in the relief. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the poison gas from penetrating through when the pedestal is disturbed (see below).</p>
<h4 id=pedestal>

Close inspection reveals a stone hatch in the top of it. Any physical attempt to force open the hatch releases a cloud of gas through the holes in the wall relief. The gas fills a 15-foot cube directly in front of the mural. Creatures in the area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The gas affects a creature even if it holds its breath or doesn&rsquo;t need to breathe. The gas doesn&rsquo;t linger.</p>

Only by defeating the monsters in the gladiatorial pit can the spears be obtained. When all four spears are placed in the hands of the statues, read:</p>

Gladiator Cells</h3><p>This hallway contains four cramped cells behind iron portcullises. The portcullises are locked in place and can be raised only with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or by stepping on the pressure plate in <strong>area 4D</strong>. Each cell contains a Chultan gladiator made of painted clay. Each gladiator is a golem-like creature with a bronze spear in one hand and a wooden shield in the other. It has the statistics of a gladiator, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The clay gladiator is an unaligned construct with an Armor Class of 17 (natural, shield).</li>
<li>It has a climbing speed of 30 feet and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
<li>It is immune to poison damage as well as the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions. It doesn&rsquo;t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t speak.</li>
<li>It can&rsquo;t make ranged attacks, and it can&rsquo;t be disarmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A clay gladiator fights if attacked or when called to the gladiatorial pit (<strong>area 4D</strong>). If reduced to 0 hit points outside of the gladiatorial pit, the gladiator disappears along with its possessions, reappears in its cell at full health with spear and shield in hand, and returns to the gladiatorial pit if it can. If defeated in the gladiatorial pit, the gladiator leaves its spear behind before reforming in its cell. The spear can then be taken back to <strong>area 4B</strong>. If taken from the shrine, the spear disappears and reappears in the gladiator&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The gladiators can go anywhere in the shrine but can&rsquo;t leave it. When the shrine has no other creatures inside it, the gladiators return to their cells, and the portcullises drop behind them.</p>

<p>Six-foot-high archways stand opposite one another at the bottom of the pit, the floor of which is one large pressure plate. Applying 50 pounds or more to the floor causes the portcullises in <strong>area 4C</strong> to rise with a loud clatter, whereupon the clay gladiators emerge from their cells and quickly make their way to the pit.</p>

Unless the characters intervene, the vegepygmies roll their captive off the edge of the cliff. A couple of vegepygmies leap off after him, caught in the throes of devotion.</p>
<p>The tribe consists of one vegepygmy chief, eight vegepygmy, and the chief&rsquo;s thorny pet. Statistics for all these creatures appear in appendix D. Their grung captive is the beloved one hundred and eightieth son of the grung chieftain Yorb. If the characters free Imbok, he grovels at their feet. He doesn&rsquo;t speak Common but promises to bury his benefactors in gold if they escort him back to his father&rsquo;s shrine (<strong>area 18</strong>). Imbok&rsquo;s promise is empty, but he has nothing else to offer his saviors.</p>

<p>The walls of this rubble-strewn corridor are carved with serpents, and arrow slits are spaced along them every 5 feet. Cobwebs fill the arrow slits and hang like drapes from the corridor ceiling. Above the entrance, a stone plaque bears a cuneiform message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The message on the plaque is written in Old Omuan and reads,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Moa teaches us that secrets hide the truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explorers must heed this message to find the shrine&rsquo;s puzzle cube.</p>
<p>The arrow slits are 6 inches wide, 2 feet tall, and 1 foot deep. A character who peers through an arrow slit after clearing out the cobwebs can see into the room beyond (<strong>area 6D</strong>), provided the character has a light source or can see in the dark.</p>

Chamber of Deception</h3><blockquote>
<p>In the middle of this room, a stone cube rests on a plain stone pedestal. Statues of twelve tribal warriors jut from the surrounding walls, aiming bows at the pedestal. The floor in front of the pedestal bears a mosaic depicting a monstrous serpent constricting a furious monkey. Moss obscures much of the detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mosaic shows Moa (a jaculi) fighting Wongo (a su-monster). If a character peels the moss aside, they uncover the following message written in Old Omuan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Death rewards a thief deceived. Truth comes from the serpent&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another inscription encircles the floor and tells the story of how Moa upheld the truth to Ubtao and betrayed Wongo&rsquo;s trust (see &ldquo;Legend of the Nine Gods,&rdquo; page 92).</p>
<p>The puzzle cube on the pedestal is illusory, though it feels real to the touch. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of illusion magic around the cube. When taken from the shrine, it vanishes in a puff of green smoke. If a creature removes the puzzle cube from the pedestal or tries to damage one of the statues, the archers animate and open fire on all creatures in the room. The archers can detect the presence of creatures even if they are invisible. Before they open fire, arrows magically appear in their bows. The archers remain animated for 1 hour, after which they revert to their inanimate state.</p>
<p>The twelve archers act on initiative count 20. On its turn, a statue shoots one arrow (+6 to hit). A creature hit by an arrow takes 5 (1d8+1) piercing damage. Each statue is a Medium object with AC 17; 30 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>

<p>Bag of Nails yearns for a hunter&rsquo;s death. Senility has taken hold, and now he sees all creatures as his prey.</p>
<p>When the characters arrive, Bag of Nails is hiding in a ruined building on the east bank of the river, 150 feet from the fallen tree. To spot him, a character must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check. When a character crosses the bridge, Bag of Nails opens fire. After each shot, he leaps across the rooftops to a new firing position and tries to hide.</p>
<p>Bag of Nails is a tabaxi assassin, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bag of Nails is chaotic neutral.</li>
<li>He has a climbing speed of 20 feet and the Feline Agility trait (see below).</li>
<li>He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</li>
<li>He knows Common, Dwarvish, and thieves' cant.</li>
<li>As an action, he can make a melee weapon attack with his claws (+3 to hit), dealing 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.</li>

<p>If Bag of Nails drops to fewer than half his maximum hit points, he surrenders to his enemies, leads them to his lair (a ruined basement), and offers them stew in a show of friendship. While distributing bowls of stew, he explains that he came to Omu to find a fabled treasure called the Navel of the Moon (see chapter 5). He hoped to use its alleged powers to find his lost son, but he has long since given up hope of ever finding it. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the tabaxi has no intention of letting the characters leave his domain alive. He laces the stew with midnight tears (see &ldquo;Poisons&rdquo; in chapter 8 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>).</p>

Shrine Entrance</h3><p>Above the doors is written an inscription in Old Omuan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Unkh urges us to contrast all options before acting.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unkh&rsquo;s priests were contemplative but prone to indecision. Their message is a clue to solving the shrine&rsquo;s puzzle. The doors to the shrine are not locked and hang heavy on their hinges. Each door weighs 600 pounds, so one or more characters need a combined Strength score of 20 or higher to heave them open.</p>

Ruined Workshop</h3><blockquote>
<p>The roof of this workshop collapsed long ago, and now a thick mass of plants grows from the rubble. Through the moss, you see hundreds of iron keys hanging from hooks on the wall. Some are bent and broken, while others are rusted beyond repair. The rest look serviceable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the keys unlocks the pedestal in <strong>area 8C</strong>. If the characters know which key to look for, they find it after a few minutes of searching.</p>

Chamber of Contemplation</h3><blockquote>
<p>A statue of a giant snail looms before you. In place of antennae, it has five pseudopods ending in rocky clubs. Along the walls, six iron keys hang in small niches above stone plinths. Behind the statue, a carved pedestal in a wide alcove has a keyhole set into its base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statue is 9 feet tall and represents the trickster god Unkh as a flail snail. Three ghast (undead Chultan tribesfolk) hide behind it. Each ghast has Ras Nsi&rsquo;s symbolâa small blue triangle-tattooed on its forehead. The ghasts leap out from behind the statue and attack as soon as the characters enter the room.</p>
<p>None of the keys in this room unlock the pedestal. However, they are all similar in size. If a character takes all six keys and overlaps them, their overlapping teeth form a particular pattern. A search of the ruined workshop (<strong>area 8B</strong>) yields a single key that matches this pattern. This key unlocks the pedestal.</p>

If a character inserts the correct key in the keyhole and turns the key a quarter turn clockwise, the puzzle cube emerges from a concealed hatch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pedestal grinds around on the spot. As it turns, an ornate stone cube corkscrews up from a concealed hatch in its surface.</p>

<p>The puzzle cube can now be safely removed from its pedestal.</p>

<p>Using thieves' tools, a character can pick the lock on the pedestal with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check. A character who fails the check by 5 or more accidentally triggers the trap.</p>

When this happens, each creature in the shrine must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Any creature that fails the save is struck by a ray and takes 33 (6d10) radiant damage. The statue can&rsquo;t emit rays while wholly or partly contained with an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch>.</p>

<p>Amid the ruins is an abandoned campsite. Torn backpacks and rotted gear litter the ground around the three moldering tents. At the center of the camp, a scrap of dirty yellow cloth hangs from a crude wooden flagpole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This camp was made by the Company of the Yellow Banner, a party of explorers that arrived in Omu over six months ago. All the explorers are now dead. For further details, see chapter 5.</p>
<p>Characters who search the area discover a moldy parchment caught in the lining of one of the tents; give the players a copy of handout 13. The leader of the company, Lord Brixton, left this letter behind for a missing comrade. The rest of the camp has since been looted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sculptural reliefs decorate the doors of this shrine. The carvings show a horned rabbit charging a small, feral-looking bear with sharp claws. A cuneiform message is etched above the doors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The message is written in Old Omuan and reads,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;jin teaches us to take the path least expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;jin taught her followers to live unpredictable lives, always changing course and never sticking to a plan. Characters would do well to heed her message inside the shrine.</p>
<p>Smaller inscriptions hidden underneath the carvings tell the story of how I&rsquo;jin (an almiraj) earned the ire of Obo&rsquo;laka (a zorbo) by spoiling a stew prepared for the god Ubtao. For details, see <em>&ldquo;Legend of the Nine Gods,"</em>.</p>

<p>Thirty-two tiles cover a 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide stretch of the hallway. Each tile is 5 feet square, and the tiles are arranged in eight rows of four. The beasts depicted on the tiles are almiraj, dragonflies, eagles, giraffes, monkeys, tigers, warthogs, and zebras.</p>

If more than 20 pounds of pressure is exerted on the wrong picture tile, four poison darts shoot from holes in the walls. Each dart makes a ranged weapon attack (+5 to hit) against a random target within 10 feet of the triggering tile. A single creature can be attacked by multiple darts. A creature hit by a dart takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A character can spot the holes with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts from launching.</p>
<p>Characters can avoid the trap by flying or teleporting across the hallway, or by using <wc-fetch type=spell>spider climb</wc-fetch> spells to crawl along the walls or ceiling. The walls are too smooth to climb otherwise.</p>

Labyrinth</h3><p>Traps are riddled throughout this dusty maze. Hidden pressure plates in the floor are located in the positions marked X on the shrine map. If more than 20 pounds of pressure is exerted on a pressure plate, a sharpened axe blade swings from a hidden compartment in the ceiling.</p>
<p>The blade makes a melee attack (+6 to hit) against any creature standing on the pressure plate. On a hit, the target takes 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage. A character searching for traps spots a pressure plate and ceiling compartment with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. Wedging an iron spike or other object under a plate prevents the trap from triggering. Using thieves' tools, a character can dismantle an axe blade with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the trap triggers and makes an attack against the character with disadvantage.</p>

Chwinga Wagon</h3><blockquote>
<p>An overturned wagon lies on the street ahead. Rotting flower petals litter the ground around it, and bees nest in its broken wheels. A freshly cut garland of jungle flowers hangs from the wagon&rsquo;s tongue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wagon is home to a chwinga. The vegepygmies in the area are afraid of the chwinga and bring it gifts of flowers to appease its wrath. In truth, the chwinga is harmless.</p>
<p>The chwinga uses its magic to hide in a mossy stone disk underneath the cart (see &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Decree&rdquo; below). Characters who approach the cart notice that the area is unusually lush and full of life. If they leave an offering, the chwinga timidly presents itself to them. If not, the chwinga&rsquo;s natural curiosity forces it to shadow the characters and spy on them.</p>
<p>The scent of honey foreshadows the chwinga&rsquo;s appearance, and harmless bees follow it around. It has a fascination for humanoid hair and is likely to latch onto a bearded dwarf or a character with curly tresses. While the chwinga accompanies the party, any vegepygmies that encounter the group flee as soon as they discern the chwinga&rsquo;s presence. The chwinga&rsquo;s affinity for the natural world keeps it from following characters into shrines or dungeons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A moss-covered stone disk lies half-buried in the mud underneath the wagon. Concentric rings of inscriptions cover its surface-some written in Common and others etched in jagged cuneiform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tablet is a proclamation from an Omuan queen to her rivals in Mezro. The Mezroans couldn&rsquo;t read the Omuans' native script, so the tablet contains the same message written both in Common and Old Omuan. It reads,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Queen Napaka proclaims that the free people of Omu fear nothing. Brave new gods protect us, as Ubtao did before but does no longer. Omu will rise again, and Napaka shall reclaim all that is hers by right of conquest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the tablet, the characters can translate any message written in Old Omuan. The tablet is 3 feet in diameter and weighs 200 pounds, but characters with ink and parchment can copy it or take a rubbing. If the characters move the tablet from the cart, they end up taking the chwinga with it.</p>

Wongo&rsquo;s Shrine</h3><blockquote>
<p>Carvings of monkeys hanging by their tails decorate two cracked obelisks that stand before a shrine enclosed by broken walls. Past the obelisks is a courtyard filled with horsetails and arum lilies. Five archways open into darkness at the base of the ruin. Mounted above the central arch is a stone plaque bearing a cuneiform inscription.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shrine to the trickster god Wongo (represented by a su-monster) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods. The inscription above the central arch is written in Old Omuan and reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Better to be Wongo&rsquo;s friend than his enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A ten-foot-tall stone statue of an evil-looking monkey balances on its tail atop a stone dais in the middle of this twenty-foot-high chamber. The statue&rsquo;s limbs are splayed, with hands and feet cupped. On the wall behind, a sculpted relief shows a monkey-like creature tearing into a giant serpent. Cuneiform inscriptions are carved above and below the relief. Four masks of painted stone protrude from the walls; they depict the heads of a lion, a zebra, a boar, and a vulture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wall relief shows the trickster god Wongo (a su-monster) fighting his hated enemy, Moa (a jaculi). Inscriptions in Old Omuan explain how Moa betrayed Wongo to the god Ubtao (see <em>&ldquo;Legend of the Nine Gods&rdquo;</em>).</p>

A character who searches the statue&rsquo;s base uncovers the following inscription written in Old Omuan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Wongo&rsquo;s friend knows where to pour the water.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wongo&rsquo;s &ldquo;friend&rdquo; (the vulture) can be identified by figuring out the logic puzzle written above the masks in the viewing corridors (<strong>area 12C</strong>).</p>
<p>When a character pours a pint or more of water into the statue&rsquo;s right hand or one of its cupped feet, the liquid sizzles and transforms into 1d3 steam mephit that fight until destroyed. The statue can create up to six steam mephits in this fashion, after which no more mephits can be created until the next dawn. A steam mephit reduced to 0 hit points loses its form and disappears.</p>
<p>When a pint or more of water is poured into the statue&rsquo;s cupped left hand, Wongo&rsquo;s puzzle cube appears by magic on the statue&rsquo;s head. When the puzzle cube appears, the character who poured the water hears a snarling, disembodied voice say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Take the prize and curse your friends, or fight my children to claim it. What is your choice?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a character takes the puzzle cube, the masks on the walls deliver their curses (see <strong>area 12C</strong>). If no character takes the cube immediately, the portcullises slam shut over the entrance corridors in <strong>area 12A</strong> as four su-monster are teleported into the room, clinging to the statue like startled children to a protective parent. The su-monsters leap down and attack. Once the su-monsters appear, taking the puzzle cube doesn&rsquo;t trigger the masks' curses. The summoned su-monsters are real, and their bodies don&rsquo;t disappear when they die.</p>

<p>A ruined amphitheater looms over the surrounding buildings. Vines cling to its steps, and animal statues line its stands. The muddy ground outside is stripped clean of vegetation. An eerie silence hangs over the area. No birds cry, no insects chirp, nothing stirs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amphitheater is the lair of the King of Feathers, a powerful tyrannosaurus rex with magical abilities. As they approach the amphitheater, characters can&rsquo;t fail to notice giant clawed footprints in the mud. From toe to heel, each footprint spans over 5 feet. Closer to the ruin, they find long, slender feathers in scarlet, orange, and green hues, and heaps of dung large enough to bury a dwarf.</p>
<p>The amphitheater is an open-air, semicircular structure with tiered seats overlooking a ruined stage. The Omuans used it for public debates and plays both comic and tragic. Narrow passages and rubble-strewn chambers spread beneath the grandstands. This darkened maze is home to five Deinonychus. While the tyrannosaurus is out hunting, the deinonychuses leave their lair and prowl throughout the amphitheater, attacking other creatures on sight. Strewn about their lair are Omuan relics (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>

<p>The monstrous tyrannosaurus known as the King of Feathers is the undisputed lord of Omu. Most other dwellers of the Forbidden City live in fear of its thunderous approach and steer well clear of the amphitheater, its lair.</p>
<p>The King of Feathers can be encountered anywhere within Omu. At first, tease the characters with glimpses of it moving through distant fog or have them hear its roar echoing over the ruins. It might appear while the heroes are exploring the ruins or taking a rest. Alternatively, it might interrupt a fight that&rsquo;s going badly for the party (or is too easy).</p>

Ruined Bazaar</h3><blockquote>
<p>A derelict market hall stands on the street corner ahead. Frayed cloth awnings hang in tatters above a broad alley lined with stalls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kobolds live in hidden cellars underneath the ruined market hall and have set six traps throughout the bazaar. A character has a cumulative 20 percent chance of finding a trap for each minute spent searching the bazaar. When a trap is found, have the character make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the check succeeds, the character spots the trap (a hidden, springloaded catapult) and its triggering mechanism (a tripwire or pressure plate) without triggering it. Once spotted, the trap is easily disarmed or avoided (no check required). A failed check indicates that the character accidentally set off the trap, which duplicates the Weapon Invention attack of a kobold inventor.</p>
<p>After the characters find three traps, they spot a kobold disappearing down a well-hidden staircase on the outskirts of the bazaar. If they follow the creature, it leads them to the cellars under the marketplace.</p>

All but one of the staircases leading into their lair has been caved in or blocked with heaps of furniture. As the characters make their way through the cellars, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guttering torches cast dim light under the arches of a wine cellar roughly 20 feet square. The cracked ceiling is 8 feet high. In an alcove on the far side of the room, a pile of treasure twinkles in the torchlight. Kobolds gather around it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kakarol, a kobold scale sorcerer, rests on the pile of treasure. Two kobold inventor and ten kobold are also present. Statistics for the kobold scale sorcerer and kobold inventor appear in appendix D.</p>
<p>The kobolds rally to defend Kakarol. While they fight off intruders, Kakarol and his inventors make ranged attacks from the rear. If things look dire, Kakarol throws himself at the characters' mercy.</p>

Kakarol&rsquo;s kobolds spy on most other factions in the city. If gifted with enough treasure, he could become a useful early warning system for the adventurers.</p>

<p>The mosaic shows the trickster god Papazotl (an eblis) fighting his enemy, Kubazan (a froghemoth). Inscriptions in Old Omuan surround the mosaic.

<p>A character who examines the pedestal finds a riddle inscribed on its base. (Give players a copy of handout 15 in appendix E.) Unlike other inscriptions in the trial chambers, this riddle is etched in Common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Comes with sunshine</em></p>
<p><em>Leaves with night</em></p>

<p>The answer to the riddle (&ldquo;a shadow&rdquo;) is a clue to finding the secret chamber (<strong>area 16D</strong>).

No matter how hard the characters try, they cannot pry the hatch open. Papazotl&rsquo;s puzzle cube within only emerges when all six statues are blindfolded (see <strong>area 16D</strong>). When this occurs, read:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The characters can now safely take the puzzle cube.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A city of magnificent, whitewashed buildings stretches out before you. Sunlight sparkles off of glass domes and windows, yet all is not well. Black smoke coils from fires across the city, corpses litter the streets, and wraiths circle the rooftops like vultures. A sphere of utter darkness grows out from the heart of the city, blotting out the light as it expands toward you. You turn away, and when you look back, the darkness is gone. The city is a half-flooded, overgrown ruin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While in Omu, the character who saw the vision has the same dark dream whenever he or she takes a long rest. In the dream, the character is standing in the city during its fall and sees a skeletal figure walking alone through the dead streets. He wears tattered robes and holds a skull-tipped staff, and his sunken eyes contain points of dead light. With each dream, the figure (Acererak) gets a little closer.</p>

<p>Monoliths adorned with prancing, frog-like figures rise from the swamp. Beyond, a ruined edifice shaped like an arrowhead squats in the muddy water. Bushes and trees grow from its roof. At the pointed front of the building, steps ascend to a stone door caked in slime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shrine to the trickster god Nangnang (represented by a grung) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods. The water around the shrine is 2 feet deep.</p>

Shrine Entrance</h3><p>The shrine is home to a gold-skinned grung elite warrior named Chief Yorb. Four orange-skinned grung elite warrior wallow in the flooded courtyard with Yorb and his trained hadrosaurus mount. One red-skinned grung wildling and seven green-skinned grung lurk on the shrine&rsquo;s 20-foot-high rooftop. See appendix D for these creatures' statistics.</p>

</p>
<p>The grungs on the roof unleash arrows to ward off intruders. If the intruders fight back, more green-skinned grung close in from nearby buildings, with 1d4 appearing at the end of each round until twenty have arrived.</p>
<p>The grungs are jumpy and distrustful of strangers. At first, Yorb is more interested in scaring away intruders than he is talking with them. If the characters rescue his favored son in <strong>area 5</strong> and have the means to communicate with the chief, Yorb opens up to them. He currently has no idea his son is missing.</p>
<p>The grungs worship the dead trickster god Nangnang. If the characters enter into negotiations with Yorb, he can recount the full legend of Omu&rsquo;s nine trickster gods (see <em>&ldquo;Legend of the Nine Gods&rdquo;</em>).</p>

Chamber of Greed</h3><blockquote>
<p>Torches shed light over rooms filled of treasure: chests heaped with coins, polished amphorae, strings of pearls, and ornate pieces of armor. Set into the floor in front of another double door is a mosaic depicting a frog-like humanoid beating a leopard that has snakes emerging from its shoulders. Cuneiform inscriptions are woven above and below the combatants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inscriptions are written in Old Omuan. The one above the mosaic reads,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nangnang teaches us to serve only ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inscriptions below tell how Nangnang (a grung) stole a spear belonging to Shagambi (a kamadan). For details, see <em>&ldquo;Legend of the Nine Gods&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>While the treasures remain in the shrine, they look and feel real. If a character removes a treasure from the shrine, the illusion drops and the treasure reverts to its true form: gold coins become disks of tin, silver decanters revert back to clay jugs, and glittering armor becomes rusty scrap metal. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that the treasures radiate auras of illusion magic while in the shrine. None of these &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; are valuable.</p>

<p>To date, even Chief Yorb hasn&rsquo;t learned what lies on the other side of the doors. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the doors.

<p>Voj takes orders from Zagmira and knows the legend of Obo&rsquo;laka and I&rsquo;jin. If the characters defeat him, they find some valuables on his person (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below) that aren&rsquo;t obtainable while Voj is petrified.</p>

Even on a success, a creature holding the cube must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns until the puzzle cube is removed from the shrine. When the torches in this room are inserted into the empty brackets in <strong>area 19B</strong>, Obo&rsquo;laka&rsquo;s puzzle cube can be handled safely.</p>

The torches can be extinguished, but they reignite every time they reenter this chamber. Relighting a torch by any other method proves impossible. If all eight torches are inserted into the empty brackets in <strong>area 19B</strong>, the puzzle cube can be handled safely.</p>

Secret Passage</h3><blockquote>
<p>This dark passage is choked with dust and webs. It&rsquo;s clear that no one has been through here in years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traversing this corridor is the easiest way to transport the torches in <strong>area 19E</strong> to <strong>area 19B</strong> without dousing their flames in the pools. The secret door leading to <strong>area 19B</strong> has three wooden bars across it. Once the bars are removed, the door pulls open easily.</p>

Royal Palace</h3><blockquote>
<p>Thousands of bats swirl above a great ruin. Behind a 15-foot-high circular wall, you see crumbling arcades, vine-choked statues, empty plazas, and buildings overgrown with banyan roots. Streets that aren&rsquo;t flooded are choked with rubble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The palace looks abandoned and has been looted of all treasure. Snakes slithering through the rubble are mostly harmless (but see <strong>area 20A</strong> and 20B below). The bats flying above the ruin are also harmless.</p>
<p>The Fane of the Night Serpent (see chapter 4) lies under the palace. There are two entrances: a large entrance to the north (<strong>area 20A</strong>) and a hidden entrance to the south (<strong>area 20B</strong>). Watching over each entrance are three type 1 yuan-ti malison (type 1) in snake form. They slither out of hiding, revert to their true forms, and attack anyone who isn&rsquo;t accompanied by yuan-ti.</p>

Main Entrance to the Fane</h3><p>The north entrance to the Fane of the Night Serpent is easy to find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A worked tunnel descends into the earth here. Muddy cart-tracks wind back and forth from the entrance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tunnel slopes down to <strong>area 1</strong> of the yuan-ti temple (see chapter 4).</p>

Secret Entrance to the Fane</h3><p>The south entrance to the Fane of the Night Serpent is hidden behind palms and thorny bushes. Yuan-ti who pass through here always try to cover their tracks. To find the entrance, a character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check while searching the vicinity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lifting aside the palm fronds, you uncover a narrow, rough-hewn passage descending into the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage connects to <strong>area 23</strong> of the yuan-ti temple (see chapter 4).</p>
