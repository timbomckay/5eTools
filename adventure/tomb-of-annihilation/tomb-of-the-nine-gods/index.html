<p>Acererak built the Tomb of the Nine Gods not only to house the remains of Omu&rsquo;s trickster gods, but also to slay interlopers. However, few today even know the tomb exists, and thus it remains an enigma. Rare are the tavern tales that lure adventurers to its gates, and its horrors remain undocumented in the libraries of Candlekeep. The reason for this is simple: not one person who has entered the tomb has lived to tell the tale.</p>

The archlich devised brutal trials for each burial chamber, and sprinkled riddles and illusions throughout to deceive intruders. When the building work was done, he fed his slaves into the death trap to test its efficacy. The archlich turned some of his victims into undead and flesh golems, then locked them inside the tomb to serve as guardians. Acererak then resumed his wanderings.</p>
<p>In Acererak&rsquo;s absence, the tomb snared adventurers from faraway lands and harvested their souls to feed the archlich&rsquo;s phylactery, which remained hidden on another plane. Every few decades, Acererak returned to tinker with his dungeon&rsquo;s traps, add treasure to its vaults, and reap a bounty of hoarded souls. His planar wanderings have influenced the tomb&rsquo;s mishmash of architectural styles, and have populated it with strange and deadly monsters.</p>

He brought it to Toril, ensconced it in the cradle of his tomb, and began feeding it necromantic energy, hoping to transform it into a deity: one able to claim dominion over death. Unleashed on Toril, the newborn death god would glut itself on life until none but the dead walked the world.</p>
<p>To nurture the atropal, Acererak needed an untold number of souls. The archlich made a bargain with the Sewn Sisters, a coven of night hags feared throughout the Lower Planes. Seduced by the prospect of a near-endless supply of souls, the hags joined Acererak in his tomb. With their assistance, the archlich crafted the Soulmongerâ€”a necromantic device that could reap the souls of the dying from across Toril and feed them to the atropal. Leaving the Sewn Sisters behind as nursemaids, Acererak abandoned his tomb to watch the rise of the death god from afar.</p>

The handles that unlock them are hidden within the features of relief carvings along the walls, including inside the jaws of many graven skulls.</p>
<p>A secret door can be spotted by any character within 5 feet of it who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 20 or higher, or with a search and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>

Their trails crisscross back and forth, making other creatures in the tomb difficult to track. The freshest tracks belong to the skeleton keys (see &ldquo;Tomb Inhabitants&rdquo; below). Any character who tries to follow a skeleton key&rsquo;s trail can do so with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check, finding the way to the nearest unexplored location marked with a skull symbol on the dungeon map.</p>
<h3 id=tomb-inhabitants>

<h4 id=withers-and-the-tomb-dwarves>
<a href=#withers-and-the-tomb-dwarves class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Withers and the Tomb Dwarves</h4><p>Withers, Acererak&rsquo;s undead custodian, oversees the undead maintenance crew that keeps the tomb&rsquo;s traps in working order. To assemble that team, Acererak abducted dwarf miners and transformed them into wights to exploit their expertise at underground construction. Withers acts as supervisor for the dwarves and serves as Acererak&rsquo;s adjunct when the archlich visits the tomb. Using his scrying pool at <strong>area 25</strong>, Withers can command Omu&rsquo;s gargoyles and speak to agents on the surface world.</p>
<p>Withers and his crew use the staircase at <strong>area 26</strong> to roam unseen through the tomb&rsquo;s many levels. When their work is done, they retreat to their secret headquarters on level 2 of the tomb (areas 27 and 28). Withers avoids contact with the characters when possible, confident that Acererak&rsquo;s traps will defeat them.</p>
<h4 id=legendary-monsters>
<a href=#legendary-monsters class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Legendary Monsters</h4><p>Two legendary monsters dwell in Acererak&rsquo;s tomb: a beholder guarding a treasure vault (<strong>area 44</strong>) and an aboleth lurking in an underground lake (<strong>area 65</strong>). These creatures can&rsquo;t use lair actions within the tomb, and the regional effects of each creature&rsquo;s lair are localized to the levels where they dwell.</p>
<p>Despite being the dungeon&rsquo;s creator, Acererak doesn&rsquo;t count the Tomb of the Nine Gods as his lair. Consequently, no lair actions or regional effects are ascribed to the archlich in this adventure.</p>
<h4 id=skeleton-keys>
<a href=#skeleton-keys class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Skeleton Keys</h4><p>To unlock the final gate to the Soulmonger, the adventurers must acquire five skeleton keys-each the carved skull of an animated human skeleton that roams the tomb. The characters can capture and control these skeletons, or can simply snap a skull off its spine.</p>
<p>A skeleton key has the statistics of a skeleton, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The skeleton key is unaligned.</li>
<li>It has a climbing speed of 30 feet and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
<li>It wields a pair of daggers and can make two melee weapon attacks (+4 to hit) as an action. Each dagger attack deals 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage on a hit.</li>
<li>When reduced to 0 hit points, a skeleton key falls apart, though its skull and bones remain intact.</li>
<li>A skeleton key does not trigger any trap placed in a room or on a door of the tomb.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each skeleton key has a skull that extends into a carved key-like shape. These shapes match the keyholes of the skeleton gate in the lair of the Sewn Sisters (<strong>area 71</strong>). The Skeleton Keys table summarizes the location and shape of each key.</p>
<h5 id=finding-a-skeleton-key>
<a href=#finding-a-skeleton-key class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Finding a Skeleton Key</h5><p>Each of the first five levels of the tomb has its own skeleton key. A skeleton key can be encountered in any of the locations marked with a skull symbol on the level map. You choose a skeleton key&rsquo;s location. You can also change your mind and relocate the skeleton key to make it easier or harder to find.</p>
<p>Apart from unlocking the skeleton gate in <strong>area 71</strong>, the skeleton keys perform no function. When the characters enter an area containing a skeleton key, it might be standing in the middle of the room, standing in a corner, walking across the ceiling, or clinging to a wall. A skeleton key&rsquo;s primary goal is to avoid capture or destruction, so it flees if it can.</p>

Once complete, these shambling golems are released into the tomb to hunt intruders.</p>
<p>A tomb guardian is a flesh golem clad in plate armor, giving it AC 17. One or two tomb guardians should appear whenever you feel the need for combat. As the characters delve deeper into the tomb, they should come to know these monsters well.</p>

Legend speaks of how Sadamor saw the depths of humanity&rsquo;s evil reflected in the opal of his crown. Heartbroken, he created a doomsday device-a <wc-fetch type=item>sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch>-to swallow the world but was consumed by his own creation.</p>
<p>The yuan-ti nightmare speaker Fenthaza (see chapter 4) believes that the Black Opal Crown can awaken Dendar the Night Serpent. If the characters find the crown, Fenthaza tries to kill them before they escape Chult with it. The crown rests in the maze of death (<strong>area 49</strong>).</p>

The gem is a relic of the cult of Zaltec, and its dagger-like point was plunged into the hearts of countless sacrifices.</p>
<p>An adventuring band known as the Company of the Yellow Banner entered Omu to find the Eye of Zaltec and was never seen again. The Eye of Zaltec is guarded by a stone juggernaut (<strong>area 62</strong>).</p>

It is said that anyone who holds the stone can always find the way home to his or her loved ones.</p>
<p>The tabaxi hunter Bag of Nails (see chapter 3) came to Omu in search of the Navel of the Moon but failed to find it. The Navel of the Moon is set into the pendulum of a grandfather clock inside a secret room (<strong>area 56</strong>).</p>

The legendary Chultan hero Ch&rsquo;gakare (pronounced chuh-GAH-kah-ree) is said to have beheaded the king after escaping the Nine Hells on the back of a mastodon.</p>
<p>Princess MwaxanarÃ© (see <em>&ldquo;Kir Sabal,"</em> and appendix D) is keen to recover the Skull Chalice of Ch&rsquo;gakare as part of her bid to reclaim the throne of Omu. To obtain it, characters must first survive the perils of the hall of the golden mastodon (<strong>area 67</strong>).</p>

Acererak&rsquo;s magic and the magic of the <wc-fetch type=item>amulet of the black skull</wc-fetch> are unaffected.</p>
<p>Spells that would normally allow creatures to transport into and out of the tomb either fail or deposit their recipients in <strong>area 57</strong>. Spells that normally allow one to pass through stone fail, and divination spells cast within the tomb provide false readings. Spells designed to communicate over long distances are similarly foiled. These alterations are summarized in the Modified Spells table. Spells not included in the table might suffer similar alterations, at your discretion.</p>
<p>Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally, as does magic that involves the creation of an extradimensional space. Any spells cast within an extradimensional space (such as that created by <wc-fetch type=spell>rope trick</wc-fetch>) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast in the tomb.</p>

<ul>
<li>The replacement character broke into the tomb centuries ago but was imprisoned inside a magical carving. When one of the other characters accidentally leans against this carving, the replacement character is released from captivity.</li>
<li>The replacement character hails from another world (Athas, Krynn, Oerth, medieval Earth, or any other milieu of your choosing) and is trapped in stasis within the tomb as one of Acererak&rsquo;s trophies. If the character is touched, the archlich&rsquo;s binding magic ends.</li>
<li>The replacement character is a clone of the fallen adventurer. The hags in <strong>area 71</strong> created and tortured the clone to gain information about the adventurers' presence in the tomb. Having escaped, the new character suffers from amnesia and has scant memory of the hags. The clone has gear scavenged from dead adventurers.</li>
<li>The new character is the sole survivor of a doomed adventuring company that breached the tomb in order to find and destroy the Soulmonger.</li>

When a creature of the humanoid type touches such an item, the trickster god bound within attempts to inhabit that creature. With a successful DC 16 Charisma saving throw, the creature resists the god&rsquo;s power, and that god can&rsquo;t attempt to inhabit the same creature for the remainder of the adventure. On a failed save-or if the creature chooses to forgo the save-the god&rsquo;s spirit inhabits the creature&rsquo;s body. The trickster gods can tell whether or not a creature is humanoid, and they have no interest in possessing other types of creatures.</p>
<p>While inhabiting a host body, a trickster god acts like an overbearing passenger. The host creature remains in control of its actions but inherits a flaw from the god, as well as a special power. When a trickster god inhabits a player character, give the player that god&rsquo;s card. A character doesn&rsquo;t know what power and flaw are gained from a specific trickster god until that god inhabits the character for the first time. Both the flaw and the power end when the spirit leaves the host.</p>

A trickster god can also be forced out by another trickster god (see &ldquo;Fighting Over a Host&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>When the spirit of a trickster god is forced out of a host, it returns to the magic item to which it is bound and cannot inhabit that host again for the remainder of the adventure. If the item is destroyed or taken from the tomb, the trickster god&rsquo;s spirit finds another object within the tomb to inhabit.

Assign &ldquo;even&rdquo; to one god and &ldquo;odd&rdquo; to another, then roll any die. The result determines which god is victorious, with the losing god forced out of the host. The host has no influence over which god gets forced out.</p>

The character retains his or her alignment and can think independently. However, if the character has a flaw that runs counter to the trickster god&rsquo;s flaw, the character&rsquo;s flaw is suppressed until the trickster god&rsquo;s spirit leaves the character&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>You can roleplay the voices of the trickster gods in the characters' heads, but let the players roleplay their characters' inherited flaws. If a player neglects to roleplay a trickster god&rsquo;s flaw, have the inhabiting spirit attempt to goad the character into behaving more like it. You can award inspiration to a player who roleplays a trickster god&rsquo;s flaw particularly well.</p>
<p>All the trickster gods are eager to get their revenge on Acererak. They can offer only limited guidance regarding the tomb and its denizens, but they encourage the characters to seek out other trickster god spirits and offer supernatural assistance in the final battle against the archlich.</p>
<p>Each trickster god (except Unkh) has its own rival in the tomb that it would prefer to avoid. The Omuans dreamed up colorful stories to explain these antipathies, but in truth, the spirits simply represent conflicting points on the alignment axes. When rival spirits occupy different characters in the same group, they try to make their hosts bicker and defy each other whenever possible.</p>

Acererak&rsquo;s Warning</h3><blockquote>
<p>Near the base of the cliffs, a fifteen-foot-tall obelisk of cracked stone is draped with vines and black moss. Behind it, you see a dark passageway obscured by withered creepers. A second, smaller tunnel burrows into the base of a cliff to the east.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tunnel leading to the tomb&rsquo;s true entrance (<strong>area 4</strong>) is obscured by vegetation and cannot be detected unless the characters search for it. However, any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check around the areas of the false entrance (<strong>area 2</strong>) or the open gallery (<strong>area 3</strong>) notices something more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three stone gargoyles watch you from narrow ledges carved into the cliff side. Each has the face of a bearded devil, its mouth agape in a silent scream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three gargoyle are perched on the ledges overlooking the obelisk, at the points marked G on map 5.1. The ledges are 30 feet above the ground, 5 feet wide, 2 feet deep, and spaced 25 feet apart. The gargoyles swoop down and attack anyone who tries to topple or damage the obelisk, or who attacks them first.</p>

Clearing the vines and moss from the south face of the obelisk exposes a message carved into it in Common. (Give the players a copy of handout 17 in appendix E.) The message reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

</span></p>
<p>The warnings Acererak has placed on the obelisk and on the grand staircase (<strong>area 7</strong>) provide clues to overcoming some of the challenges of the tomb. The obelisk&rsquo;s clues pertain to features and locations on level 1, specifically the true entrance (<strong>area 4</strong>), the devil face (<strong>area 5B</strong>), Obo&rsquo;laka&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area 10</strong>), Moa&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area 14</strong>), and Wongo&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area 16</strong>).</p>
<p>Characters with a combined Strength of 60 or more can topple the obelisk, breaking it off at the base. Breaking or destroying the obelisk releases a cloud of black smoke that coalesces into a nalfeshnee demon. The demon appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the obelisk and attacks those responsible for the obelisk&rsquo;s desecration. After 1 minute, the demon disappears and returns to the Abyss.</p>
<p>The teleportation function of the ebon pool (<strong>area 81</strong>) returns characters to the obelisk even if it is toppled or destroyed.</p>

Gallery of Tricksters</h3><blockquote>
<p>Alcoves run the length of a narrow tunnel, each one featuring a bestial statue standing or squatting above a basin of oil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statues depict the nine trickster gods, with each facing pair of alcoves dedicated to two trickster gods who oppose each other. Moving down the hall from west to east, the opposing statues depict Moa (jaculi) and Wongo (su-monster), I&rsquo;jin (almiraj) and Obo&rsquo;laka (zorbo), Papazotl (eblis) and Kubazan (froghemoth), and Nangnang (grung) and Shagambi (kamadan).</p>
<p>Each statue is 3 feet tall and can&rsquo;t be moved from its pedestal. When any character carrying a puzzle cube (see chapter 3) enters the tunnel, the oil basin matching the cube&rsquo;s trickster god bursts into flame. A detect magic spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination magic around the statues. The oil basins give off an aura of conjuration.</p>
<p>Only eight trickster gods are initially visible; the statue of Unkh (flail snail) is hidden behind a secret door at the end of the tunnel, though it functions the same as the others. Bringing Unkh&rsquo;s puzzle cube into the tunnel lights Unkh&rsquo;s brazier, giving characters advantage on ability checks made to find the secret door.</p>
<h4 id=treasure>

False Entrance</h3><p>After 20 feet, a puzzle door sealing off a small chamber beyond blocks this false entrance into the tomb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A short tunnel ends at a slab of worked stone, whose edges are marked by relief carvings of grinning skulls. Four lines engraved at the center of the slab cross one another to form a star, with both ends of each line marking the location of a cube-shaped cavity cut into the door-eight cavities in all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each cavity is sized to hold one of the puzzle cubes recovered from the shrines of Omu (see chapter 3). However, there are nine puzzle cubes in total and only eight cavities.</p>
<p>If puzzle cubes representing every trickster god except Unkh are inserted into the cavities in such a way that the cubes of rival gods are opposite to one another, a stone block slowly descends over the tunnel entrance. Any character in the tunnel must decide whether to stay or to flee, which requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Characters who stay or who fail the check are trapped when the stone block seals off the tunnel. Once the tunnel is sealed, caustic gas billows out from the mouths of the relief-carved skulls. Any creature trapped in the tunnel must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) poison damage and 5 (1d10) acid damage. While any affected creature remains in the tunnel, it must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. After 10 rounds, the gas valves close and the stone block rises back into the ceiling. Any puzzle cubes still in their cavities are pushed out, and the trap resets.</p>
<p>Any character searching the tunnel for traps spots the raised stone block with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. The weight of the block makes it impossible to hinder its descent. Any character who examines the puzzle door and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check notices holes in the mouths of the skulls. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the gas from being released. Doing so while the trap is active is difficult, requiring six successful DC 10 Dexterity checks, each made as an action.</p>
<p>Beyond the false door is a gas-filled chamber. Any creature that starts its turn in this area takes 11 (2d10) poison damage and 11 (2d10) acid damage.</p>

True Entrance</h3><p>Thick foliage conceals the true entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. Any character searching the base of the cliff at this location finds the entrance with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pulling aside the heavy undergrowth, you uncover an archway in the cliff face. Stone skulls peer down from the lintel, and old bones litter the threshold. As light strikes the entrance, a swarm of bats screeches out from within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bats are harmless. Jungle predators use this tunnel as shelter, and the bones are a mix of grung and velociraptors. Any character who searches for tracks discovers boot prints leading into the tomb. The tracks are not recent and belong to the last group of treasure seekers to enter here.</p>

First Puzzle Door</h3><blockquote>
<p>A slab of worked stone blocks the overgrown tunnel some twenty feet from the entrance. Grinning skulls mark the edges of the slab, in the center of which are nine cube-shaped cavities arranged in three rows of three.</p>
</blockquote>

</span></p>
<p>Give the players copies of the god symbols in handout 11 of appendix E. The individual squares can be cut out to be arranged by the players as they wish, or they can simply make notes on paper.</p>
<p>To open the door, the characters must fill the cavities with all nine puzzle cubes retrieved from the shrines of Omu (see chapter 3), but in the proper configuration. The cubes representing the trickster gods must be placed so that each god is opposite its rival&rsquo;s cube on the grid, with Unkh (who is neutral and has no rivals) in the middle. For example, a puzzle cube inserted into a corner of the grid must have its rival in the diagonally opposite corner. Diagram 5.1 shows one possible configuration, though others will work as long as Unkh is situated between I&rsquo;jin (CN) and Obo&rsquo;laka (LN), between Kubazan (CG) and Papazotl (LE), between Moa (LG) and Wongo (CE), and between Nangnang (NE) and Shagambi (NG).</p>

</span></p>
<p>If a puzzle cube is placed incorrectly, any previously placed cubes pop out. Electricity then erupts from the incorrectly placed cube, dealing 18 (4d8) lightning damage to any creature within 20 feet of the door. A <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> spell can be used to place the cubes from farther away and avoid this damage.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of evocation magic around each of the cavities. If the characters place the cubes correctly, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nine cubes flare with light, then disappear. Growling like an angry beast, the slab begins to slide up into the ceiling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the door opens, the puzzle cubes teleport back to their respective shrines in Omu. Once the door has fully risen, it remains open for 1 hour before slowly sinking back into place. Characters who are outside when the door closes must revisit the city to recover the cubes.</p>

Second Puzzle Door</h3><p>When the characters move past the first door, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another slab blocks the hallway twenty feet beyond the first door. An iron lever is set into the door&rsquo;s surface, with a graven stone skull leering down from above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a character reaches the midpoint of the hall, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The skull&rsquo;s jaws creak open, and a skeletal hand holding a crystal hourglass-style timer emerges from within. With a click, the timer rotates and sand starts to trickle into its lower globe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Count down slowly from 10, and let the players tell you what, if anything, their characters do in that time. If the characters don&rsquo;t pull the lever by the time you&rsquo;ve finished your countdown, the lever and the sand timer retract as the door sinks into the floor, revealing <strong>area 5</strong> beyond. The sand timer can&rsquo;t be budged or damaged.</p>
<p>After remaining open for 1 hour, the door slowly rises to seal off the passage once more. Characters can prevent the door from rising by jamming iron spikes into the surrounding floor seams. The lever resets when the door returns to its closed position. The door can&rsquo;t be opened from the north side.</p>
<h4 id=pit-trap>

Each creature standing on the floor when the lever is pulled tumbles into a 20-foot-deep pit lined with poisoned spikes. With a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, the character who pulled the lever can avoid falling by hanging onto it. The pit remains open until the lever is reset to its original position.</p>
<p>Each creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and is impaled on 1d4 spikes, each of which deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage and 5 (1d10) poison damage. Any creature that takes poison damage from one or more spikes is poisoned for 24 hours, or until the condition is removed with a lesser restoration spell or similar magic.</p>
<p>Spotting the seam along the floor requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Characters can hammer spikes into the floor to prevent it from dropping, but at least ten spikes are needed because of the floor&rsquo;s size and weight.</p>

Poison Darts</h4><p>Each X on the map marks a 5-foot-square pressure plate triggered by 20 pounds or more. When a plate is triggered, four poisoned darts shoot out from spring-loaded tubes in the walls. Each dart makes a ranged attack (+8 to hit) against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate. Any creature hit by a dart takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>Moss obscures the tiny holes in the walls through which the darts are fired, but they can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. With a careful inspection of the floor and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notes irregularities in the floor&rsquo;s tile patterns that reveal the pressure plates. Wedging an iron spike or similar object under a plate prevents that plate from being triggered. Stuffing the wall holes adjacent to a pressure plate with cloth or wax prevents the darts from being fired.</p>

Devil Face</h4><p>Magical darkness and a permanent <wc-fetch type=spell>silence</wc-fetch> spell fills the mouth of the devil face and a large cavity behind it. The face is sculpted from stone and melds seamlessly with the surrounding wall, and its mouth is wide enough for a Medium or smaller creature to crawl through. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of illusion magic over the face.</p>
<p>The cavity behind the devil&rsquo;s mouth is home to a shadow demon that can see normally in the magical darkness. If any creature reaches into the mouth, the demon makes an attack against it with advantage, then continues attacking if any creature enters its abode.</p>
<p>A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 16) cast on the demon&rsquo;s lair dispels the magical darkness and the silence. If the darkness is dispelled, the shadow demon emerges and attacks until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, at which point it flees to a darker area of the tomb.</p>

<p>If the characters take action at once, they can catch the tomb dwarf. The tomb dwarf uses the statistics of a wight, except that it wields a battleaxe and a light crossbow. If it is not caught, the creature moves silently through the secret door to <strong>area 25</strong>.

Magical Attraction</h3><blockquote>
<p>A rusting statue of a knight stands at the west end of this hall, gripping a large iron shield. Shards and flakes of rusted metal cover the floor around the statue&rsquo;s feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A magical field around the statue attracts metal objects of any kind (not just ferrous metal). Any metal object that comes into direct contact with the shield disintegrates, showering the floor with powdered rust. Artifacts are immune to this corrosion. Any metal object not being worn or carried that enters the room is instantly drawn to the shield if it weighs 150 pounds or less. Any creature wearing or carrying metal items that enters the room or starts its turn there can feel the pull of the statue and must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to resist it. On a failed check, the creature loses its footing, flies across the chamber, and slams into the statue, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved. If the character is wearing metal armor, the check is made with disadvantage. The shield disintegrates only metal objects that come into direct contact with it, so a metal object stored in a backpack would be protected from destruction by the pack&rsquo;s leather.</p>
<p>A detect <em>magic spell</em> or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic over the shield. The statue and shield are treated as a single Large object with AC 17; 40 hit points; immunity to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the statue and shield are destroyed, the trap is disabled. A successful dispel magic (DC 17) cast on the statue shuts down the attractive field for 1 hour.</p>

Obo&rsquo;laka&rsquo;s Tomb</h3><blockquote>
<p>This vaulted tomb is overgrown with moss and creepers. A stone sarcophagus rests on a stepped dais in the middle of the floor. On the wall behind the sarcophagus, two large statues of bears grip a five-foot-diameter bronze disk embossed with a dozen glaring eyes.</p>
<p>Six desiccated corpses slump on thrones in niches along the walls. Each corpse wears a black mask made of papier-mÃ¢chÃ© and feathers.</p>
<p>An arched crystal window to the east offers a view of the tunnel beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <strong>area 6</strong> for a description of the crystal window.</p>
<p>The corpses slumped on the thrones are six dormant wight. If the eyes on the bronze disk spot intruders in the tomb (see &ldquo;Disk of Eyes&rdquo;), the wights rise and attack. The wights also attack if one or more of them takes any damage. They won&rsquo;t leave the chamber to pursue intruders. Once all intruders are dead or gone, the wights return to their thrones and fall dormant once more.</p>
<h4 id=disk-of-eyes>

These eyes have darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If the eyes spot any humanoids inside the tomb, the wights awaken and attack. The disk of eyes can&rsquo;t perceive any humanoid that dons one of the papier-mÃ¢chÃ© masks worn by the wights, nor can it see in magical darkness or while covered with a blanket or similar object.</p>
<p>The bronze disk weighs 250 pounds. The bear statues grip the disk tightly in their stone paws, so that it can&rsquo;t be pried free without smashing the statues. Each statue is a Large object with AC 17; 45 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination magic around the disk.</p>

Trapped Chest</h3><blockquote>
<p>Water pours from cracks and seams in the rough walls of this cavern, whose floor is a muddy pool that flushes out into the tunnel beyond. Just above the pool&rsquo;s surface, a large treasure chest dangles from rusty chains embedded in the ceiling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chest is 6 feet long, 3 feet wide, 3 feet high, and suspended 1 foot above the surface of the 5-foot-deep pool. A keyhole shaped like a cackling demon skull decorates the front of the lid. Encircling the keyhole, a tiny inscription in Common reads,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I devour all but the greatest thieves.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chest is locked and doesn&rsquo;t appear to be trapped. However, a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of evocation magic around it. Picking the lock requires a successful DC 22 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools. This also disarms the lock&rsquo;s magical trap, allowing the chest to be opened safely.</p>
<p>If the check fails, the demon skull bites down on the thieves' tools and destroys them. If the check fails by 5 or more, the magical trap teleports the character making the check inside the locked chest, whereupon the character is restrained. The chains holding the chest then release it into the water, where it sinks to the bottom of the pool. Even if the chest is removed from the water, a character trapped within runs out of air after 5 rounds (see &ldquo;Suffocating&rdquo; in chapter 8 of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>).</p>
<p>The chest is a Medium object with AC 13, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Any character who attempts to pick the lock or hit the chest with a melee or ranged attack while it&rsquo;s underwater does so with disadvantage.</p>

Stone Skull</h3><blockquote>
<p>A giant stone skull crusted with moss juts out from the end of the passageway. A flame flickers within each of its eye sockets, and a view into a chamber beyond can be seen through its open jaws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who peers through the skull can see into <strong>area 14</strong> (see the description below). The skull&rsquo;s jaws are opened wide enough to allow a Medium or smaller creature to climb though.</p>
<p>Each time a creature climbs through the skull&rsquo;s jaws, one of the flames in its eye sockets snuffs out. The third time a creature climbs through, the jaws clamp shut, making a melee weapon attack with a +10 bonus. On a hit, the target creature takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and is grappled (escape DC 19). While it remains grappled, the creature takes 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. When that creature exits the jaws, the flames in the skull&rsquo;s eye sockets reignite, the jaws open, and the trap resets.</p>
<p>The flames within the eye sockets give off no heat or smoke, and they can&rsquo;t be extinguished except in the manner described above. Any character searching the skull and succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notes that the lower jaw is hinged. A stout object jammed into the skull&rsquo;s jaw holds it open for as long as the object can withstand the damage.

Moa&rsquo;s Tomb</h3><blockquote>
<p>Skulls crusted with dried mud glower from niches cut into the walls of this tomb. A stone sarcophagus stands at the center of the chamber, its lid adorned with a coiled serpent carved in relief. Behind the sarcophagus, resting atop a marble pedestal, is an ornate crystal box with a small humanoid skull floating inside it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters enter this tomb from the secret passage along the river, they see the concave inner surface of the stone skull at <strong>area 13</strong>.</p>
<p>A maze of tiny passages is cut into the walls beyond the niches, and any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear the faint yet grotesque scuttling of insects from within. Hundreds of tarantula-sized undead spiders crawl through these warrens.</p>

The magic of the crystal box preserves her consciousness, but centuries of solitude and horror have caused her mind to blank out the details of her plight. The first character to enter the tomb hears Nepartak call out telepathically:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Nepartak magically senses the presence of intruders, using telepathy to question all the characters. Roleplay her as a terrified child lost in the dark. In her panic, she might ask any of the following questions:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you friends of my father? Is he looking for me?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To safely explore this area, the characters must calm Nepartak without revealing her true predicament. Lying to her requires a successful DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check. If the characters reveal that she&rsquo;s nothing more than a disembodied skull, if they fail three Charisma checks to deceive her, of if they simply ignore her, Nepartak grows increasingly anxious, then flies into a murderous rage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The voice shrieks in horror as the skull&rsquo;s eye sockets flare with green flame. With a shattering crash, the crystal box explodes and the skull levitates into the air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nepartak has the statistics of a flameskull but doesn&rsquo;t speak, instead communicating using telepathy out to a range of 30 feet. When she attacks, swarms of mummified spiders pour out from the niches at the start of the following round.</p>

They are treated as swarm of spiders, except that they are susceptible to effects that can target undead.</p>
<p>The warrens are too narrow for Medium and larger creatures to enter, and Small creatures must squeeze to traverse them (see &ldquo;Movement and Position&rdquo; in chapter 9 of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>). Tiny creatures can move through the warrens freely. The swarms attack any creatures that enter the warrens or any creatures in Moa&rsquo;s tomb if Nepartak becomes enraged.</p>

Wind Tunnel</h3><blockquote>
<p>Carved birds soar across the walls of this corridor. Blocking the passage near its northern end is a large adamantine propeller with five sharp blades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character discerns that the entire floor of the corridor is a single pressure plate. The adamantine propeller has AC 20, 30 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage. It thunders into motion whenever more than 20 pounds of pressure is placed on the corridor floor. Once activated, the propeller spins up to full speed in 6 seconds. If the weight is removed from the floor, the blades take a full minute to slow to a stop.</p>
<p>While the propeller is spinning up or slowing down, a creature can leap through a gap between two blades with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed check, the character takes 33 (6d10) slashing damage as it passes through the blades.</p>
<p>At full speed, the propeller deals 66 (12d10) slashing damage to any creature that passes through it, and the blades are turning too fast for a creature to leap between them. The rapidly spinning propeller also creates a wind tunnel effect, such that any creature that comes within 10 feet of the propeller or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw. A creature that fails the save is hurled northward into the pit in <strong>area 16</strong>. If this forced movement causes the creature to pass through the propeller, the creature takes damage from the spinning blades.</p>
<p>One can jam the propeller by fixing an <wc-fetch type=item>immovable rod</wc-fetch> in place between two of the blades. Other magic items wedged between the blades are knocked aside as the propeller turns. The propeller destroys all nonmagical objects lodged between its spinning blades.</p>
<p>While the propeller is motionless, a creature that isn&rsquo;t incapacitated can jam the mechanism with its body. When the propeller begins to turn, the creature must make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the propeller is jammed until the start of the creature&rsquo;s next turn, when it can use its action to repeat the check. A creature that fails the check or chooses to extricate itself takes 11 (2d10) slashing damage and is ejected north of the propeller.</p>
<p>If the propeller is jammed for 3 consecutive rounds, it breaks down and becomes nonfunctional. At dawn the next day, Withers sends tomb dwarves to repair the damage and return the trap to its operational state.</p>

<p>A deep pit opens up at the entrance to this tomb, with a stone sarcophagus resting at the bottom. A snarling monkey-like creature decorates the sarcophagus lid. Beyond the pit, three treasure chests sit on stone daises. The chest on the left is carved of black onyx, the middle chest is made of rusty iron, and the chest on the right is cast of silver and glistening with frost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pit is 20 feet deep. To unlock Wongo&rsquo;s sarcophagus, the characters must turn three keys hidden inside the treasure chests.</p>

All three are unlocked and (for the most part) empty. The chests cannot be moved, and they are impervious to damage and spells.</p>
<p>Opening any chest reveals a 3-inch-long gold key protruding from an adamantine keyhole set into the underside of the chest&rsquo;s lid. The key cannot be removed, and adamantine clamps prevent it from being turned while the chest is open. When the chest lid closes, a muffled click sounds from within the lid as the clamps around the key release. Any character who climbs inside a chest and closes its lid can turn its golden key with ease.</p>
<p>If a chest&rsquo;s key is turned while the chest is shut, the chest locks and the clamps snap shut on the key once more. Any character inside the chest when this happens is trapped. At the same time, a button magically appears on the lid of Wongo&rsquo;s sarcophagus.</p>

Consequently, the lid cannot be removed. The stone sarcophagus is impervious to damage and spells.</p>
<p>Whenever one of the three chests is locked, a carved button magically appears on the sarcophagus lid above the monstrous image of Wongo. The material of each button matches its corresponding chest: onyx, rusty iron, or silver. Pressing the button simultaneously unlocks the associated chest and triggers a trap within it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pushing the onyx button forces any creature inside the onyx chest to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 75 (10d6+40) force damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage turns to a pile of dust, leaving behind whatever gear it was holding or wearing.</li>
<li>Pushing the rusty iron button causes any nonmagical metal objects inside the rusty iron chest (including objects carried or worn by a creature in the chest) to corrode into worthless piles of rust. Objects partly made of metal are ruined as their metal components decay.</li>
<li>Pushing the silver button causes any creature inside the silver chest to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all three buttons on the sarcophagus lid have been pressed, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stone sarcophagus turns to transparent crystal, revealing a mummified monkey-like creature within. Clutched in its desiccated claws is a fearsome mace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the sarcophagus turns crystalline, it becomes brittle, having AC 5, 10 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It shatters if reduced to 0 hit points, whereupon the su-monster mummy within animates and attacks. In its first round of combat, the mummy activates its <wc-fetch type=item>mace of terror</wc-fetch> to unleash a wave of terror against the characters. Thereafter, it makes melee attacks using the mace or its rotting fists.</p>

<p>Red smoke seethes from the head of the mace, forming the outline of a monkey with a long tail. With a roar, the smoky apparition leaps at you, screaming, &ldquo;Let me in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Wongo&rsquo;s card. If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the mace and waits for another character to come into contact with it.

Devil Pit</h3><blockquote>
<p>The walls and floor of this fifteen-foot-square room are cracked and carved with images of terrified humanoids falling. Set into the middle of the floor is a stone bas-relief of a bearded devil face, painted green. Forlorn cries echo from the black void of its gaping maw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The devil face forms the mouth of a 5-foot-wide cylindrical shaft that descends 10 feet before opening up in the ceiling of <strong>area 35</strong>. Magical darkness fills the mouth and the shaft. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals auras of evocation and illusion magic within the shaft.</p>
<p>A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 16) cast on the darkness dispels it. If the darkness is dispelled, its fading essence magically coalesces into a swarm of bats that flies up out of the shaft and attacks any creatures in the room.</p>

Gravity Ring</h3><blockquote>
<p>At a four-way intersection, the corridors to north and south curve upward and out of sight, but with no rails or steps to allow them to be climbed. The corpse of a half-human, half-goat creature in robes sprawls ten feet to the north. It grips a staff tipped with a bronze goat&rsquo;s head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The curving corridor forms a perfect circle, imbued with magical gravity that keeps creatures bound to the floor as they walk along it. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation within the corridor.</p>
<p>The corpse belongs to Devlin Bashir, a Calishite wizard and member of the Company of the Yellow Banner. Devlin&rsquo;s goat-like features are the result of a curse, and he was killed by tomb dwarves after he became separated from his companions. Any inspection of his remains reveals that he was killed by wounds from axes and crossbow bolts. Devlin&rsquo;s ink-stained robes contain a journal that hints at the tomb&rsquo;s mysteries (see &ldquo;Devlin&rsquo;s Journal&rdquo; below). A search of the corpse also yields more valuable belongings (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>

Any creature passing through this gate emerges into a parallel reality. Characters who walk the length of the circular corridor notice that Devlin&rsquo;s body is no longer present-nor are any companions who waited behind for them. If they step back through the gate, they return to their own world.</p>
<p>To test his traps, Acererak crafted a &ldquo;mirror tomb&rdquo; and hid it inside a demiplane. This mirror tomb is identical to the real tomb as it stood exactly one year ago. All objects and creatures encountered in the mirror tomb appear real, but they fade away if taken to the real world. The mirror tomb has the same magical defenses as the true tomb, and any character who dies in the demiplane is trapped by the Soulmonger.</p>
<p>Each dawn, Acererak&rsquo;s magic replaces the mirror tomb with a fresh fabrication. Slain monsters reappear in their original locations, and moved objects teleport back to where they were found. When this occurs, characters inside the mirror tomb witness a strange distortion ripple through the air.</p>

Earlier entries chronicle the exploits of the Company of the Yellow Banner in Chult. The company made landfall at Kitcher&rsquo;s Inlet and followed the River Olung to Lake Luo before cutting southwest into the jungle toward Omu. The journal describes harrowing encounters, the adventurers' search for puzzle cubes in Omu, their brushes with the yuan-ti, and the discovery of the true tomb entrance. Only the final entry mentions their experiences in the tomb, but no mention is made of Devlin&rsquo;s staff (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>

<p>Devlin&rsquo;s staff is a <wc-fetch type=item>staff of striking</wc-fetch>, but any character who attunes to it transforms into a goat-humanoid hybrid over the course of 3 days. Tieflings are immune to this curse. Throughout the first day, shaggy fur begins to grow all over the cursed character&rsquo;s body. After 24 hours, the character&rsquo;s eyes become goat-like, and stumpy horns sprout from the brow. On the last day, the character&rsquo;s fingers and toes meld into double digits, and the horns grow to full length. This transformation doesn&rsquo;t prevent the character from wielding weapons or casting spells. <wc-fetch type=spell>Remove curse</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch>, or any other effect that ends a curse restores the character&rsquo;s original appearance, but only a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell can rid the staff of its power to transform those who attune to it.</p>

False Tomb</h3><p>Nested in the ceiling of the western tunnel is a stone block. A character who searches the tunnel spots the block with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The block is part of the room&rsquo;s trap (see &ldquo;Trap&rdquo; below).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room smells of wine. On a checkerboard marble floor, a gilded coffin sparkles in sunlight streaming down from the chamber&rsquo;s vaulted ceiling, which arches twelve feet overhead. Four huge stone gargoyle heads, their mouths agape, protrude from the walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Illusion magic generates the sunlight that shines on the coffin. This light is treated as real sunlight, and creatures averse to sunlight are affected by it. The gargoyle heads are 5 feet tall and 5 feet wide, with mouths that are 2 feet in diameter. Behind each head, an airtight stone valve blocks a crawlway. The valves remain closed until the room&rsquo;s trap activates, though a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check can force open a valve. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the illusory sunlight dispels it and prevents the trap from triggering.</p>

<ul>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the coffin. A wooden plaque inside the coffin reads, in Common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Drown your sorrows&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the illusory sunlight falling from the ceiling strikes the plaque when the coffin is opened, the stone block in the corridor outside the room slowly descends, sealing the entrance in 6 seconds. A creature that wishes to enter or leave the tomb during this time can do so, moving up to its speed. If the creature ends its movement under the block, it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature manages to get out from under the block on the side it was moving toward. If the save fails, the creature takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. If this damage reduces the creature&rsquo;s hit points to 0, it is crushed to a pulp; otherwise, the creature is shoved into the room. The block is impervious to damage and spells. When fully lowered, the block is airtight and refuses to be budged.</p>
<p>Four enormous cisterns filled with red wine are hidden in the walls behind the gargoyle heads. When the stone block seals off the entrance, the valves behind the heads open, causing the wine to pour from the gargoyles' mouths and nostrils. The wine floods the tomb at a rate of 1 foot per round. Trying to crawl into a gargoyle&rsquo;s mouth while wine is gushing out of it requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>As the wine begins pouring into the room, all creatures present must roll initiative. Track the passage of rounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of round 3, three wine weirds (use water weird statistics) flow into the tomb from the northwest, northeast, and southeast cisterns. The weirds attack anyone in the tomb and are invisible while fully immersed in wine.</li>
<li>After 12 rounds, the wine fills the tomb. Use the underwater combat rules in chapter 9 of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em> to handle fighting in these conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visibility within the wine is limited to 5 feet. The ability to breathe water does not help a character drowning in wine. When 10 minutes have passed, the stone block sealing the tomb rises back up to its niche in the ceiling. The wine cascades down the west tunnel, pouring down the grand staircase (<strong>area 7</strong>). At dawn the next day, Withers sends tomb dwarves to clean up the room and tunnel, after which the wine cisterns magically refill and the trap resets.</p>

<p>Three oval holes are carved into a nine-foot-wide, ninefoot-high stone door at human head height. As you approach, three humanoid heads stick out of the holes, each covered in putrid flesh and gnashing on an iron bit bolted to a chain bridle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gnashing heads belong to three zombie that are chained to a pulley bolted to the ceiling on the south side of the door. The pulley is set up in such a way that when all three zombies move away from the door, they heave it open. The zombies won&rsquo;t move while fresh meat tempts them from the balcony, but if they are successfully turned, they raise the door as they flee toward the south.</p>
<p>The door weighs 1,000 pounds. Characters with a combined Strength score of 33 or more can lift the door. The zombies attack any creatures they can reach. Withers and his tomb dwarves replace destroyed zombies within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Six glass cauldrons brimming with humanoid bones line the walls of this tomb, at the center of which stands an ancient chariot bearing a bronze sarcophagus with treasure strewn atop it. Paintings on the chariot&rsquo;s body show a tall bird with a long, sharp beak. On the south wall, a bronze shield bears the embossed image of a Chultan warrior carrying a spear, below an inscription that reads,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bow before no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four bronze statues stand on pedestals to either side of the shield. They depict Chultan warriors: one holding a sword, two with spears, and one missing its face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Papazotl&rsquo;s bones are contained within the sarcophagus, but they are well protected (see &ldquo;Glass Cauldrons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bronze Shield&rdquo; below).</p>

<ul>
<li>Greedy Nangnang encourages her host to grab some of the treasure from the chariot.</li>
<li>Nervous Obo&rsquo;laka warns its host that the cauldrons contain the bones of Papazotl&rsquo;s most zealous devotees who, even in death, might seek to protect him.</li>

All the skeletons act on the same initiative count. A cauldron disgorges one additional skeleton at the start of the skeletons' turn each round until the cauldron is destroyed or the tomb is cleared of interlopers. When no enemies remain, any remaining skeletons return to the cauldrons.</p>
<p>Destroying the cauldrons stops the flow of skeletons, as does bowing before the faceless statue (&ldquo;Bow before no one&rdquo;). Each cauldron is a Large object with AC 15, 22 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of conjuration around the cauldrons. An empty cauldron weighs 500 pounds.</p>

It radiates conjuration magic to a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect.</p>
<p>If the chariot, the sarcophagus, or the treasure is disturbed, or if the shield is removed from the wall, the hunter embossed on it animates. Each round on initiative count 20, it flings a magical spear of force at the nearest character it can see, ignoring any creature that has bowed before the faceless bronze statue. The hunter can&rsquo;t see any creature behind the front-facing side of the shield. When it hurls a spear at a creature, the hunter makes a ranged spell attack (+10 to hit) and deals 18 (4d8) force damage on a hit. A target reduced to 0 hit points by this attack is disintegrated and turns to dust.</p>
<p>To stop the shield&rsquo;s hunter from attacking, a character must blind it by draping something opaque over the shield (such as a sack or cloak) or turning the shield to face a wall. The shield can also be destroyed; it has AC 15, 10 hit points, and is immune to all damage except force damage. If taken from the room, the shield vanishes and reappears on the wall between the statues.</p>

Bottled Genie</h3><blockquote>
<p>Ancient cobwebs fill this narrow corridor, whose midpoint features an arched alcove. Within the alcove, a dusty bottle stands on a table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bottle is stoppered and contains a dao named Keshma al-Wazir, who was trapped centuries ago by Acererak. Anyone examining the bottle spots the genie waving from within and hears her muffled voice calling out. Keshma speaks Terran only. At first, she orders the characters to release her. If they refuse, she tries to bargain with them (see &ldquo;Roleplaying the Dao&rdquo; below). While trapped inside the bottle, Keshma can&rsquo;t attack or cast spells. Once she&rsquo;s released, she can cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>tongues</wc-fetch> spell to better communicate with her liberators.</p>
<p>If the bottle is broken or unplugged, the dao emerges in a whirlwind of sand. She fulfills whatever promise she made to the characters in exchange for her freedom, then casts <wc-fetch type=spell>plane shift</wc-fetch> in an effort to return to the Elemental Plane of Earth. (The attempt fails, naturally, and she winds up trapped in <strong>area 57</strong>.)</p>

As befits a dao, she regards the characters as lesser creatures and bargains with them only if they refuse her commands.</p>
<p>At first, Keshma promises the characters riches in exchange for freedom-the sapphires coiled through her braided hair and the platinum armbands (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). Such baubles mean little to the dao in the greater scheme of things, but she feigns anguish in surrendering them. If the characters press for more, Keshma promises to take them anywhere in the multiverse. Finally, she offers to travel with them through the tomb and aid them three times with her spells.</p>
<p>Once freed, Keshma remains true to her word. However, she won&rsquo;t tolerate any slight to her honor. If she feels insulted, she attacks the characters and attempts to enslave them.</p>
<p>The dao could become a thorn in the characters' side or a difficult ally. Her ignorance of the tomb&rsquo;s defenses confines her to <strong>area 57</strong> if she casts <wc-fetch type=spell>plane shift</wc-fetch>. If she escapes from <strong>area 57</strong>, she expects the characters to help her find a safe way out of the tomb. When she learns of the trickster gods, Keshma encourages the characters to seek them out and use them to defeat Acererak.</p>

When Nangnang&rsquo;s spirit manifests, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you touch the egg, a tendril of slime rises from its surface and transforms into a frog-like head that bobs toward you. A croaking voice sounds out in your mind: &ldquo;Nangnang will help you now.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Nangnang&rsquo;s card. If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the egg and waits for another character to touch it.</p>

Scrying Pool</h3><blockquote>
<p>Behind the secret door, water fills a carved stone font.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Withers uses this font to speak to creatures outside the tomb and contact his tomb guardians. A detect magic spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination over the water. When any character gazes into the font, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the water begins to swirl, eerie light emanates from within the basin. Slowly, an image resolves on the water&rsquo;s surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those gazing into the font can see through the eyes of a random tomb guardian as it patrols the dungeon. Pick a random level (or roll a d6) and describe the guardian&rsquo;s path through it. The guardian relies on darkvision to see, so images in the pool are in black and white. The images fade and the scrying effect ends if no character gazes into the water.</p>
<p>Unless one of the characters gazing into the pool is wearing an <wc-fetch type=item>amulet of the black skull</wc-fetch> (see <strong>area 28</strong>), the tomb guardian becomes aware of the party&rsquo;s scrying after 1 minute. When that happens, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The surface of the pool explodes, and a hulking figure wearing plate armor and a bucket helm heaves itself up from the font.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tomb guardian is a flesh golem clad in plate armor (AC 17). As it emerges from the font, it attacks everyone in the chamber, fighting until destroyed. When the guardian appears, the pool loses its scrying power until the next dawn.</p>

Spiral Staircase</h3><blockquote>
<p>Three archways overlook a circular chamber where a spiral staircase descends into darkness. The staircase walls are lined with unlit torches in iron sconces and set with niches containing moldering humanoid skulls and bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This staircase descends from level 2 to levels 3, 4, and 5, with each level 25 feet below the level above. The bones and skulls in the niches belong to dead Omuans whom Acererak sacrificed to build the tomb. Withers and his tomb dwarves use these stairs to move between levels.</p>
<p>The torches can be removed from their brackets and taken elsewhere.</p>

Forge of the Tomb Dwarves</h3><blockquote>
<p>Old wooden benches and shelves along the walls of this chamber are covered with gears, chains, trap components, and cages filled with rats. Lit iron braziers hang by chains from the ceiling. Along the north wall, a stepped dais is set with a bulky contraption: an iron maiden of sorts, attached to a network of steaming pistons, tubes, and bubbling vats of blood. Five masked dwarves operate the contraption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters arrive, five tomb dwarves are working inside the chamber. Each one has the statistics of a wight, except that it wields a battleaxe and a light crossbow. If the adventurers leave this area, there&rsquo;s a 50 percent chance that 1d4 of the other tomb dwarves prowling the dungeon are present when they return.</p>
<p>Any character who searches the forge uncovers enough gear to assemble two sets of thieves' tools, a set of artisan&rsquo;s tools, a set of <wc-fetch type=item>alchemist&rsquo;s supplies</wc-fetch>, a set of mason&rsquo;s tools, and a set of smith&rsquo;s tools. The caged rats are used to test traps.</p>

As the characters arrive, the tomb dwarves are in the process of unleashing their newest creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iron contraption shudders as it opens, releasing a hissing cloud of steam. Through the roiling vapor, an armored figure wearing a bucket helm stomps into view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creature that emerges from the contraption is a tomb guardian-a flesh golem encased in plate armor (AC 17). This guardian was fashioned using the salvaged remains of Seward, an adventurer with the Company of the Yellow Banner, and a number of other unfortunate trespassers. Now a mindless undead, it attacks the characters on sight.</p>

It lies on a bench next to some tools.</p>
<p>The spirit of a female moon elf warlock known as the Starfallen resides within the <wc-fetch type=item>ghost lantern</wc-fetch>. If any character touches the lantern, the spirit can be seen within it. The spirit is insubstantial and can&rsquo;t be harmed, nor can it cause harm. It speaks and understands Common, Elvish, and Sylvan. If the lantern is destroyed, the spirit becomes trapped in the Soulmonger.</p>
<p>The Starfallen was slain almost a thousand years ago by a fomorian. After her death, her soul inhabited the lantern. The Company of the Yellow Banner found the lantern and began questing for a way to return the Starfallen to life. The fabled Eye of Zaltec was said to possess the power to raise the ancient dead. The company tracked the jewel to the tomb and perished without ever finding it.</p>
<p>The spirit of the Starfallen has weakened over time and grown forgetful. She remembers little of her past or her travels with the Company of the Yellow Banner, but certain things might jog her memory. If the players get stuck, you can use the Starfallen as a means to provide hints to keep the adventure on track.</p>

<p>Candles dimly illuminate a cluttered office. A skeletal songbird rasps at you from a filthy cage in one corner. Other furnishing include a wooden writing desk and a tall-backed chair. Anatomical drawings sketched in charcoal hang on the wall behind the desk. Seated in the chair is the shriveled corpse of a humanoid wearing moldy robes and a bronze mask sculpted to look like a frowning visage. Around the figure&rsquo;s neck hangs a black skullshaped amulet, and a number of severed hands crawl on the desk and floor around him.</p>

<p>Before he was turned into an undead creature, Withers was an Omuan engineer named Gorra. Like all of Omu&rsquo;s citizens, Gorra was enslaved and put to work constructing the tomb. When Acererak sacrificed his workers to their own dungeon, Gorra&rsquo;s traps performed the best.</p>
<p>This pleased the archlich enough that he transformed Gorra into a wight, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Withers has an Intelligence of 16 (+3).</li>
<li>He wears an <wc-fetch type=item>amulet of the black skull</wc-fetch> and doesn&rsquo;t carry a longbow.</li>

<p>5th level (1 slot): <wc-fetch type=spell>telekinesis</wc-fetch></p>
<p>When the characters arrive, Withers is working at his desk. Seven crawling claw follow him around and obey his commands.</p>
<p>Withers is fiercely loyal to Acererak. His passion for learning followed him into undeath, granting him a rare chance to study for eternity. The walls of his office are covered in papers on natural history and anatomy, and he uses the scrying pool in <strong>area 25</strong> to study the natural world through the eyes of Omu&rsquo;s gargoyles.</p>
<p>When he encounters the characters, Withers is keen to learn everything he can before killing them. He&rsquo;s particularly interested in current affairs in Chult and in the history of foreign lands. If the characters humor him, he behaves cordially while they answer his questions. Then with some regret, he finally announces that it&rsquo;s time for them to die. Withers would rather escape than be destroyed or captured, so he uses his spells to retreat if the battle goes against him, saving <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of fire</wc-fetch> to cut off pursuers when he flees.</p>

Any character who spends 10 minutes flipping through the journals finds an entry that stands out. Give that character&rsquo;s player a copy of handout 22 in appendix E. To flesh out the journals further, refer to the &ldquo;History of Omu&rdquo; section in chapter 3 and &ldquo;History of the Tomb&rdquo; earlier in this chapter.</p>

The mold smells like rotting corpses and occasionally releases clouds of harmless spores. As characters move through areas with alien growth, tiny eyeballs emerge from the mold to scrutinize them. Belchorzh can see through these eyes and uses them to track the party&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>Any effect that deals fire, necrotic, or radiant damage destroys a patch of alien growth on contact. However, the beholder doesn&rsquo;t take kindly to the mold&rsquo;s destruction. When a patch of growth is destroyed, the next nearest patch sprouts a stubby eyestalk that shoots a randomly determined eye ray at the nearest character. (Roll a d10 and consult the beholder stat block to determine which ray it produces.) After making this attack, the eyestalk quickly disappears back into the mold.</p>

<p>Four torches illuminate stone sphinxes crouched in the corners of this fifteen-foot-high room. The torches cast flickering light across hieroglyphs carved into the tiled floor. At the center of the room, a gold-inlaid funeral barge stands atop a three-foot-tall stone dais. Resting on the deck of the barge is a small golden sarcophagus decorated with horned rabbits. A dark shaft opens in the ceiling directly above the barge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view is a magical window into the past. Whoever looks through the jackal&rsquo;s jaws sees a vision of I&rsquo;jin&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area 35</strong>) as it was just before the last person entered it. After a few moments, the vision reveals a person entering the chamber.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A slab of wall suddenly grinds upward to the east, and a dwarf wearing a turban and chain mail creeps into the tomb. He brandishes a shield in front of him as he treads cautiously across the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The magic here records the last moments of Bravus Boulderborn, hero of the Company of the Yellow Banner. The dwarf ignores any attempts by the characters to communicate with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A loud click sounds out as the dwarf steps onto one of the floor tiles. Then a deafening buzzing rises as locusts pour out from the mouths of the sphinx statues, quickly engulfing him. He tries to fight them off, to no avail. When the cloud of insects vanishes, nothing of the dwarf remains except its bones and gear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all the characters turn away, the vision resets. When any character next looks through the mask, the dwarf is seen entering I&rsquo;jin&rsquo;s tomb once more.</p>
<p>The jackal mask radiates an aura of divination to a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect. If any character uses teleportation or other magic to bypass the teeth and enter the tomb, the dwarf&rsquo;s moldering skeleton is discovered in <strong>area 35</strong>.</p>

Iron Barrier</h3><blockquote>
<p>Ahead of you, the face of a snarling minotaur is etched into a sheet of iron that bisects the crawlway. Its eyes have been cut out, letting you see through the sheet, beyond which the tunnel continues onward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minotaur face is etched into both sides of a 1-inch-thick, sharp-edged iron sheet that blocks the crawlway. The holes that form the eyes are 2 inches wide. The characters can use spells such as <wc-fetch type=spell>gaseous form</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>misty step</wc-fetch> to move past the iron sheet.</p>
<p>Any character who examines the barrier discovers that it slides up into the ceiling. Coiled springs provide resistance, and a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to lift the sheet. If the check succeeds, a hidden latch locks the sheet in place, allowing creatures to crawl underneath it. Unless it is wedged in place with an iron spike, a stout weapon, or a similar object, the barrier snaps down after 1 minute, sealing the crawlway once more. Any creature underneath the sheet when it snaps shut must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 44 (8d10) slashing damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is chopped in two.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still puddles of water cover the floor of this fifteen-foot-wide hallway. The walls are slick with moisture and set with murals showing animal-headed humanoids in armor, most of which appear to brandish real weapons hanging on the walls. A three-foot-high crawlway in the east wall is flush with the floor. At the far end of the hall, a rippling, transparent curtain of water fills a stone archway. Beyond the curtain, you see another hallway that looks similar to the one in which you stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tarnished weapons hanging on the walls are in poor condition and are held in place with hooks to make it appear as though the painted warriors are holding them.</p>
<p>Twelve painted figures line each hall, six on the west wall and six on the east wall, directly across from one another. Figures on facing walls are perfect reflections of each other.</p>

A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 17) cast on the curtain causes it to vanish, leaving the archway open. The curtain magically reappears after 1 hour.</p>
<p>If any creature passes through the curtain of water carrying a trident, nothing happens. Any trident will do, not just the ones in the hallways.</p>
<p>If any creature passes through the curtain without a trident, the water erupts as a fierce wave flowing north and south. Any creature in either hall is slammed by the water and must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and is swept to the end of the hall with such great force that it falls prone. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and falls prone, but is not swept away. The weapons hooked on the walls remain where they are.</p>
<p>Water expelled by the curtain disappears before it can flow beyond the confines of the hallways. The water also does not enter either of the hidden alcoves (<strong>area 31A</strong>), so creatures there are safe from the waves' effect.</p>
<p>The water conjured by the curtain leaks out of the hall through tiny cracks in the floor, leaving puddles behind.</p>

Rotating Crawlways</h3><p>Any character searching for traps or secret doors in this tunnel notices a narrow seam in the stonework with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. This seam marks one end of a 25-foot-long section of crawlway (marked &ldquo;Tunnel A&rdquo; on map 5.3) that rotates. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character can deduce that the seam represents a point where two sections of tunnel can detach from one another.</p>
<p>When 50 pounds or more of weight is applied to the floor at the midpoint of tunnel A, a mechanism causes the tunnel to quickly rotate 90 degrees clockwise and sink 5 feet as it turns. Both ends of the tunnel are immediately cut off, trapping creatures inside. At the same time, a second crawlway perpendicular to the first (marked &ldquo;Tunnel B&rdquo; on map 5.3) rotates 90 degrees clockwise and sinks into place, positioned where tunnel A used to be. Characters who are flying, in gaseous form, or otherwise effectively weightless do not trigger the trap and can move through the tunnel safely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With a loud grinding noise, this section of crawlway begins to rotate, instantly cutting off the exits ahead and behind. You can feel the passage sink about five feet as it turns. After a few seconds, it comes to a stop and the grinding abates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When tunnel B connects to the rest of the crawlway, a new passage running north to south is formed. Tunnel B is trapped similarly to tunnel A, except that both tunnels ascend 5 feet as they rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise when the trap triggers. The only way to return tunnel A to its original position is to trigger the trap from tunnel B, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Characters trapped in a section of tunnel not connected to the rest of the crawlway have no clear means of escape. The tunnel is airtight. A single creature consumes the available air supply in 24 hours, with multiple creatures dividing that time up between them. For example, four creatures trapped in the tunnel could survive 6 hours before they begin to suffocate.</p>

Chamber of Opposition</h3><blockquote>
<p>This chamber contains a stone font filled with a steaming green liquid. Beyond it, a shadowy figure stands at an open door on the far side of the room. The figure&rsquo;s back is toward you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stone font is attached to the floor and can&rsquo;t be tipped over. It is also impervious to damage and spells. It appears to hold 40 pints (5 gallons) of hot soup, but the liquid is illusory. Tactile exploration reveals that the liquid has no substance and the font is dry.</p>
<p>The dark figure is a magical, illusory duplicate of whichever character opened the door to the room. It copies the character&rsquo;s movements, allowing a shrewd player to use the duplicate to dispense with the liquid in the font. The shadow duplicate has the statistics of a commoner and is immune to poison damage. It perfectly matches the motions of the character who created it, always keeping its back to its creator as though it was a projected image 15 feet ahead.</p>
<p>If the character who created the shadow duplicate moves backward, the duplicate moves toward the font. If the character then mimes drinking from the font, the duplicate slurps up the &ldquo;soup&rdquo; at a rate of 5 pints per round, draining the font in 8 rounds. Once the font is drained of illusory soup, a treasure appears in the font that wasn&rsquo;t there before (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). Casting dispel magic on the font causes the illusory soup to vanish, but the treasure does not appear. The illusory soup reappears 1 minute later.</p>
<p>The shadow duplicate can&rsquo;t exert pressure on objects and glides through any obstacles it encounters. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the figure causes it to vanish. It doesn&rsquo;t react to taking damage but disappears if it drops to 0 hit points or is made to leave the chamber. Closing the door to the room and reopening it creates a new duplicate of whoever opened the door. There can be only one shadow duplicate at a time.</p>
<p>The shadow duplicate has a terrible and deadly aspect. Any creature that looks upon its face sees a horrific visage locked in a silent scream and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. A creature that cannot be frightened automatically succeeds on the saving throw.</p>

Stone Block</h3><p>A 5-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick, 12-foot-tall block of solid stone fills the doorway leading to I&rsquo;jin&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area 35B</strong>). The block is featureless on the side that faces the tomb, and it is impervious to damage and spells. If the characters approach the block from the east, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The corridor ends at a block of stone on which is painted a seven-foot-tall jackal-headed humanoid with a circular gold medallion around its neck. All around the figure are carvings of locusts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close inspection reveals that one of the carved locusts is a button that can be pushed. When this happens, the stone block sinks into the floor, creating an open passage to the tomb (<strong>area 35B</strong>).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;medallion&rdquo; worn by the jackal-headed painting is actually a 6-inch-diameter gold disk engraved with the face of a horned devil, its mouth agape. Lodged behind this disk is a clay dial etched with eight hieroglyphs. One hieroglyph (a vulture) is visible through a hole that forms the devil&rsquo;s gaping mouth, but the dial is locked in place and its remaining seven hieroglyphs are hidden from view behind the medallion.</p>
<p>If any character steps on a vulture floor tile in <strong>area 35B</strong>, the dial turns, revealing a new hieroglyph: a serpent. One hieroglyph at a time, the dial reveals the correct sequence of floor tiles to stand on: vulture, serpent, door, reed, scarab, scepter, foot, and urn. Stepping on a floor tile that matches the hieroglyph on the dial causes the dial to turn, revealing the next symbol in the sequence.</p>
<p>The gold medallion is attached to the stone block with <wc-fetch type=item>sovereign glue</wc-fetch>, and removing it requires <wc-fetch type=item>universal solvent</wc-fetch>. However, one can simply destroy the medallion to get at the dial underneath. Removing or destroying the medallion exposes the dial and its eight hieroglyphs.</p>
<p>Once the medallion is out of the way, the dial can be easily removed from its spoke inside the stone block. However, removing the dial releases a corrosive gas trapped within the block. The gas escapes through tiny holes hidden behind the dial and fills the 5-foot space directly east of the block. Any creature in this area when the gas is released must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A character who searches for traps can detect the holes hidden behind the dial with a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check; once found, these holes can be plugged with wax before the dial is removed, preventing the gas from escaping.</p>

<p>Four torches illuminate stone sphinxes crouched in the corners of this fifteen-foot-high room. The torches cast flickering light across hieroglyphs carved into the tiled floor. At the center of the room, a gold-inlaid funeral barge stands atop a three-foot-tall stone dais. Resting on the deck of the barge is a small golden sarcophagus decorated with horned rabbits. A dark shaft opens in the ceiling directly above the barge, while to the south, a corridor is visible through a set of fangs carved into the wall.</p>

</span></p>
<p>To unlock I&rsquo;jin&rsquo;s sarcophagus, eight floor tiles must be stepped on in the correct sequence (see <em>&ldquo;Hieroglyphic Floor&rdquo;</em> below and handout 23 in appendix E). Stepping on the tiles in the wrong order triggers a trap (see <em>&ldquo;Sphinx Statues&rdquo;</em> below).</p>
<p>The skeletal remains were once Bravus Boulderborn, a gold dwarf cleric of Moradin and former member of the Company of the Yellow Banner. Bravus died as a result of stepping on floor tiles in the wrong order, and his body lies atop a floor tile bearing the &ldquo;foot&rdquo; hieroglyph. A search of the body yields some valuables (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>Four torches light the room. As long as they remain in their brackets, they never burn out. If a torch is removed from its bracket, it burns down normally.</p>

Give the players handout 23 in appendix E.</p>
<p>Characters can avoid triggering the floor tiles by flying or by climbing along the walls and ceiling. Climbing the walls requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Those who set foot on the tiles must traverse them in the proper sequence or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>If any character steps onto a tile and the passage to the east is open, the stone block at <strong>area 35A</strong> rises to seal the tunnel. Any creature atop the block when it meets the ceiling must succeed on a DC 7 Dexterity saving throw to leap clear in one direction or the other. On a failed save, the creature takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is crushed to a pulp. Otherwise, the creature falls prone inside the tomb.</p>
<p>The correct sequence of floor tiles matches the order in which the hieroglyphs appear on the clay dial in <strong>area 35A</strong>: vulture, serpent, door, reed, scarab, scepter, foot, urn. Each time a character steps on a correct floor tile, a new hieroglyph clicks into view on the clay dial, with that view accessible by any character using the peephole in <strong>area 34</strong>. The dial rotates through all the hieroglyphs in the correct order. If any character steps on a hieroglyph out of order, the statues react as described in &ldquo;Sphinx Statues.&rdquo; Stepping on the wrong tile does not reset the sequence.</p>
<p>When the final tile in the sequence is stepped on, the following things all happen at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;jin&rsquo;s sarcophagus opens.</li>
<li>The stone block at <strong>area 35A</strong> sinks into the floor, creating an open passage to the east.</li>
<li>Any locusts conjured by the sphinx statues are dispelled.</li>
<li>The hieroglyphic floor is disabled. After 24 hours, Withers sends 1d4 tomb dwarves to reset the trap.</li>

The statues are impervious to damage and spells.</p>
<p>When any creature steps on an incorrect floor tile, all four statues yawn and masses of magically summoned locusts fly out of their mouths. The locusts form a single cloud that fills a 15-foot cube centered above the offending floor tile. Each creature in the cloud when it forms, as well as any creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, takes 44 (8d10) piercing damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this trap is killed and eaten to the bone by the devouring locusts. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until another cloud of locusts is created.</p>

The sarcophagus is worth 7,500 gp intact but weighs 75 pounds. Removing it from the funeral barge causes four floor-to-ceiling walls of force (like those created by a <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of force</wc-fetch> spell) to surround the dais on all four sides. The walls last until destroyed or until the sarcophagus is returned to the barge.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus contains the fragile bones of an almiraj (I&rsquo;jin&rsquo;s animal form; see appendix D), as well as its spiral horn, which functions as a <wc-fetch type=item>wand of wonder</wc-fetch>. The horn turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see <em>&ldquo;Lost Treasures&rdquo;</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Streamers of light emanate from the tip of the horn. As they swirl around you, they form into a spectral rabbit with a single horn on its brow. A female voice whispers,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, quick, let me in! We must stop Acererak!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player I&rsquo;jin&rsquo;s card. If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the horn and waits for another character to touch it.</p>

Another crawlway extends off the east balcony. At the back of the west balcony, a staircase descends 10 feet to a landing and a secret door.</p>

They float at the same level as the balconies, 15 feet below the ceiling and 60 feet above the pit floor. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals auras of abjuration and transmutation around each platform. Each disk is wide enough that characters can move 10 feet before jumping (see &ldquo;Movement&rdquo; in chapter 8 of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>). The platforms bob slightly when anything lands on them, as though they were floating on water. Any creature that falls from a platform to the pit floor takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on a platform causes it to fall.</p>

Simultaneously, howling winds rise up and fill the room. Returning the lever to its original up position causes the winds to abate and the statue&rsquo;s fists to close.</p>
<p>Have all party members roll initiative whenever the winds begin to howl. While the winds are howling, any creature not standing on a floating platform that starts its turn in the room must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or gain a random form of short-term madness, determined by rolling on the Short-Term Madness table in chapter 8 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>. Constructs and undead are immune to this madness. In addition, the winds cause creatures in the room to suffer disadvantage on all Strength-based skill checks, including checks made to jump to and from the floating platforms and checks made to climb the walls.</p>

<p>This room is dark and dusty. A hulking figure wearing a bucket helm stands to the west, with one hand on an iron lever set into the wall. The south wall is sloped and has a large rectangular window five feet wide by seven feet high. The window looks into a hallway, through a rectangular hole in the hallway floor, and farther down into a well-lit room shaped like a cylinder tipped on its side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The helmed figure is a tomb guardian: a flesh golem clad in plate armor (AC 17). Its task is to pull the lever when it sees adventurers enter <strong>area 38C</strong>. The tomb guardian fights only in self-defense and has orders from Withers to not leave the control room. If it goes berserk, it ignores these orders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The walls of this narrow tunnel slope inward as they approach the ten-foot-high ceiling. Patches of mold cling to the walls and floor in the eastern half of the hall. Cut into the floor at the west end of the corridor is a three-foot-wide, four-foot-long rectangular hole with bright light spilling out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character standing next to the hole can peer down into a cylindrical room (<strong>area 38C</strong>), the curved floor of which is 15 feet below the hole.</p>
<p>The wall north of the hole acts as a one-way window, but it appears no different from the rest of the tunnel from this side. Creatures in <strong>area 38A</strong> can see into this tunnel, but creatures in the tunnel can&rsquo;t see into <strong>area 38A</strong>.

Revolving Drum</h3><p>The characters can enter this room through the rectangular hole in the ceiling (<strong>area 38B</strong>) or through a stone door in the south wall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room is shaped like a drum or cylinder lying on its side, with its south end tapering toward a small stone door. Carvings of demons decorate the stonework, with flickering flames in all their eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flickering flames were created by <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells, which fill the room with bright light.</p>
<p>When the lever in <strong>area 38A</strong> is pulled, three hidden locks seal the south door, a <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of stone</wc-fetch> spell blocks the rectangular hole in the ceiling (cutting off escape to <strong>area 38B</strong>), and the room begins revolving. When that happens, all creatures present should roll initiative.</p>
<p>Any creature that is not firmly attached to a wall, flying, or under the effect of a <wc-fetch type=spell>gaseous form</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic is knocked about the revolving room. The creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw at the start of each of its turns, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>While the room is revolving, an additional effect is triggered at the end of initiative count 10. Roll a d20 and consult the Revolving Room Effects table.</p>

<p>A fifteen-foot-wide, fifteen-foot-deep pit dominates this chamber. At the bottom of the pit, an eight-foot-tall clay figure stands motionless beside a stone treasure chest. A silver key hangs from a cord around the figure&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Two nine-foot-tall stone statues stand atop plinths on either side of the pit. A third plinth against the south wall stands empty. One of the statues depicts a hooded and bearded male figure with his left hand held high, index finger pointed up. The other portrays an armored male knight with his gauntleted right hand extended, its palm facing inward toward the knight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An invisible wall of force (as created by the <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of force</wc-fetch> spell) covers the top of the pit, shielding the clay golem and the chest below. By manipulating the statues, characters can teleport the golem up to their level, or send one of their own into the pit.</p>

Either can be identified with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) check. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each statue.</p>
<p>Any examination of the plinths reveals that each statue is set on a rotating, spring-loaded gear. If the statue of Azuth is rotated to the right, one creature inside the pit teleports onto the third plinth, forcing aside any other creature standing there. If multiple creatures are in the pit, randomly determine which creature is teleported. Rotating the statue of Torm to the right teleports anything on or above the third plinth into the pit. Even if nothing is there, a popping is heard as air rushes in to fill the empty space. When a statue that has been turned is released, it grinds back to its starting position.</p>
<p>The clay golem has orders to attack any creature that it sees and can reach. If the golem is destroyed, Withers uses his <em>manual of golems</em> in <strong>area 28</strong> to create a new one after 30 days.</p>

The chest weighs 250 pounds and is fitted with a silver locking mechanism. Opening the lock requires the silver key that the golem wears around its neck. A <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic can lift the key from around the golem&rsquo;s neck without causing the golem to attack. A character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. However, opening the chest by any means other than the silver key releases a cloud of gas that fills a 15-foot cube centered above the chest (filling the entire pit). The gas instantly corrodes and destroys all nonmagical metal that comes into contact with it, including armor and weapons. Metal objects sealed in containers are protected.</p>
<p>The chest is a Small object with AC 12, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>

Curse of the Golden Skull</h3><blockquote>
<p>A golden skull rests on a pedestal in the middle of this small, dusty room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cursed human skull plated in gold is the remains of a fool named Yaka-an entertainer who once amused the royal family of Omu. If any character touches it, the skull levitates into the air and begins to follow that character everywhere. The skull never strays more than a few feet away, teleporting back to the character&rsquo;s side if it loses sight of him or her. As it hovers, Yaka&rsquo;s skull supplies a stream of deadpan banter in a mocking, hollow voice. Unless the skull is magically silenced, its inopportune comments cause the character to make all ability checks with disadvantage.</p>
<p>Roleplay the skull as cruel and cynical, with a dark sense of humor. It knows nothing of the tomb but pretends to know all. Acererak has warded the skull with powerful magic, rendering it impervious to damage and spells. Its curse is too powerful to be broken with any spell other than <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch>, which can be used either to destroy the skull or end the curse. If the curse ends but the skull survives, it teleports back to its pedestal and waits for another character to touch it.</p>
<p>The curse can also be ended by feeding gemstones to the skull, which it craves. The skull chews up and destroys any nonmagical gem fed to it, leaving no trace of the gem behind. Once it destroys 10,000 gp worth of gemstones, the skull teleports back to its pedestal and the curse ends for the affected character.</p>

<p>Two hulking figures stand in alcoves along this long hall, facing each other. Armor is bolted to their flesh, and they wear bucket helms and spiked gauntlets. Iron collars around their necks are connected by a spiked chain that stretches across the corridor.</p>

<p>The tomb guardians in the alcoves attack any creature that attacks them or tries to move past them. They are flesh golem, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The golems are clad in plate armor (AC 17).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The bracers glow as watery light ripples across the walls. A monstrous, tentacled shadow rises from the sarcophagus, and the air fills with the stench of a swamp. A rumbling voice echoes through the tomb:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are brave to summon me. Together, we will crush the undying one!&rdquo;</p>

Veils of Fear</h3><p>This room lies beyond a double door, the outside of which is carved with leering and laughing skulls. The doors are neither locked nor trapped, and they swing inward on rusty hinges to reveal the room beyond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten feet from the doors, a thick tapestry curtain hangs from wall to wall. Its embroidery shows a scene of merriment: nobles feasting around a banquet table, a roast boar on a platter, and servants pouring wine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two more curtains hang beyond the first, each showing the same image descending into horror. When the second curtain is revealed, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another curtain hangs behind the first, showing the same scene but descended into depravity. The nobles fight with each other, partake in carnal encounters on the table, or sprawl on the floor in puddles of vomit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behind the second curtain is a third:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A scene of horror confronts you: nobles feasting on servants, eating each other alive, and setting fire to the hall. The roast boar is alive and laughing on its platter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of enchantment magic radiating from the third curtain. Any creature that looks at this curtain must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of it. A frightened creature tries to leave the room as quickly as possible and cannot reenter. Once outside the room, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that saves against this effect is unaffected by the curtain thereafter and can reenter the room.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rotting head of a giant boar is mounted to the wall behind the final curtain. Fresh blood and gore spatters its tusks, dribbling down the wall beneath it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any humanoid that can see the severed boar&rsquo;s head must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by it. On its turn, a charmed creature does nothing except approach the severed head and put its own head in the boar&rsquo;s mouth. Only one head can fit in the mouth at a time. If the boar&rsquo;s mouth is already full, a charmed creature waits patiently until the mouth is clear. Any creature that ends its turn with its head in the boar&rsquo;s mouth takes 22 (4d10) slashing damage as the boar&rsquo;s jaws clamp down. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it cannot be affected by the boar&rsquo;s head for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Destroying the Lord of the Feast ends its charm effect on all creatures. The boar&rsquo;s head is a Medium object with AC 5 and 22 hit points.</p>

<p>The door is sealed tight and can&rsquo;t be opened with ability checks or magic. To open the door, ten crystal eyes found elsewhere in the dungeon (see areas 31A, 32, 33, 35B, 37, and 39) must be inserted into the indentations. Each eye lights up as it clicks into place. With each eye that is inserted, the reflections of the characters in the mirror become progressively unhealthier-losing weight, hair, and teeth as they come to resemble undead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vault door grinds upward, revealing a domed, candlelit room fifty feet high. The polished marble floor is so perfectly reflective that it creates the illusion of standing at the entrance to a sphere. Nine alcoves filled with glittering treasure open up along the walls. In the middle of the chamber, a large spherical object hovers under a black silk drape twenty feet above the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beholder, Belchorzh (pronounced BEL-korj), floats at the top of the room. Acererak cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell to render Belchorzh invisible. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 19) cast on the beholder or contact with an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> ends its invisibility. Belchorzh reacts to intruders as described in the &ldquo;Beholder Tactics&rdquo; section below.</p>
<p>The hall contains one hundred lit candles. While the candles remain inside this vault, they burn indefinitely. If a candle is taken from the room, it burns down normally.</p>
<p>The floor beneath the dome is magically slick. Any creature that steps onto or starts its turn on the floor must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. When an untethered creature is shoved or otherwise moved across the floor, it travels in one direction and does not stop until it comes into contact with a wall or other barrier.</p>
<p>The alcoves contain treasure (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below)</p>

<ul>
<li>Impulsive Kubazan urges his host to attack whatever is hiding under the black drape, with no warning or negotiation.</li>
<li>Cautious Obo&rsquo;laka thinks a beholder is hidden under the black drape and urges her host to flee at once.</li>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>Nystul&rsquo;s magic aura</wc-fetch> spell placed on the sphere makes it seem like an evil aberration to features or magic that can sense such information.</p>
<p>The iron sphere is hollow and immobile, and it remains inert while the drape covers it. Belchorzh can use its telekinetic eye ray to remove the drape at any time, revealing the sphere and causing it to emit a magical magnetic field. Each creature in the room wearing metal armor is pulled to the sphere and becomes stuck to it, as does any metal weapon or object that isn&rsquo;t secured or being held. Any creature stuck to the sphere is restrained until the magnetic field deactivates.</p>
<p>Any ranged attack made in the chamber that uses ammunition made wholly or partly from metal has disadvantage on the attack roll; if the attack misses, the ammunition becomes stuck to the sphere.</p>
<p>Throwing the black drape over the sphere renders it temporarily inert, with creatures and objects stuck to it falling to the floor. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 16) cast on the sphere dispels the <wc-fetch type=spell>Nystul&rsquo;s magic aura</wc-fetch> spell, permanently deactivates the magnetic field, and causes the sphere to crash to the floor. This sends a web of cracks through the marble, negating the floor&rsquo;s frictionless effect and allowing creatures to move across it normally. The sphere also deactivates and falls if it comes into contact with an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> or is destroyed.</p>
<p>The sphere is a Large object with AC 20; 100 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It weighs 1,000 pounds. While the magnetic field is active, any attack made against the sphere with a metal weapon automatically hits, though the weapon becomes stuck to the sphere after impact.</p>

<p>The invisible beholder puts as much distance between itself and the adventurers as possible, while making sure to not catch the iron sphere in its Antimagic Cone.</p>
<p>Belchorzh doesn&rsquo;t pursue intruders who flee its vault. However, if the adventurers steal even one copper piece from its trove, the beholder uses the alien growth throughout this level of the dungeon against them. Whenever the characters come near a patch of the growth, it sprouts an eyestalk and attacks (see <em>&ldquo;Alien Growth&rdquo;</em>).</p>
<p>The beholder knows Deep Speech and Undercommon, and it refers to itself in the third person. Haughty and defiant, it delights in the destruction of tomb robbers while refusing to yield. Any character who understands its words can translate a few of Belchorzh&rsquo;s choice sayings:</p>

Gargoyle Guardians</h3><blockquote>
<p>At the bottom of the grand staircase, a resonant mechanical rumbling emanates from a dark shaft opening up in the middle of this chamber&rsquo;s floor. Four cylindrical stone pedestals surround the shaft, each ten feet tall, five feet wide, and featuring a tiny slot in its side. Squatting atop each pedestal is a large four-armed gargoyle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character looking down on the room from one of the balconies above or another high vantage point notices something else:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each gargoyle is contained within a square made of metallic tiles embedded in the top of its pedestal. Starting with the northernmost pedestal and going clockwise, the tiles are copper, silver, gold, and platinum.</p>

<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/ToA/FourArmedGargoyle.png alt=undefined class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>Four giant four-armed gargoyle are perched atop the pedestals, each one crouched within its square of tiled precious metal. The gargoyles remain motionless until they are provoked.</p>
<p>The slots in each pedestal are 4 feet above the floor and roughly the size of a standard coin. All humanoids must pay a tithe before leaving this room to avoid provoking the gargoyles' wrath. Specifically, each humanoid must insert a coin of the appropriate type into each pedestal (1 cp in the north pedestal, 1 sp in the east pedestal, 1 gp in the south pedestal, and 1 pp in the west pedestal). A gargoyle will always accept a more precious coin than the one required, so a character inserting a platinum coin into every pedestal could exit the room safely. A gargoyle will also accept a tithe of multiple coins of equal or greater value (10 cp instead of 1 sp in the east pedestal, for example). The pedestals have hollow cavities within them to store the coins (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The gargoyles always know when they&rsquo;re being cheated. If any humanoid leaves the room without offering sufficient coin, any cheated gargoyles spring to life and attack the cheapskate. A gargoyle also springs to life and attacks if it or its pedestal is damaged in any way. The metallic tiles atop the pedestals can be pried loose, but they turn to dust if removed from this chamber.</p>

Lizard Den</h3><p>A six-foot-tall green devil face is carved into the far end of this hallway, its mouth agape. Painted murals on the walls show faceless humanoid figures doubled over in pain, clutching at their heads and ears.</p>
<p>Despite the ominous murals and the devil face carving, this hall is devoid of traps. Any character who searches the devil face finds a lizard hiding in the carving&rsquo;s shallow mouth cavity. The recipient of an <wc-fetch type=spell>awaken</wc-fetch> spell cast by a Chultan druid, the lizard has an Intelligence score of 10 and speaks Druidic. The Company of the Yellow Banner captured it in Omu and brought it to the tomb thinking it might be useful for setting off traps. The lizard escaped and wound up here. It doesn&rsquo;t know what became of its captors and helps the characters any way it can if they promise to return it to Omu.</p>

Elemental Cells</h3><p>To reach Shagambi&rsquo;s tomb (<strong>area 48</strong>), the adventurers must pass through four cells thematically linked to fire, water, air, and earth. Unless the characters destroyed him, Withers (see <strong>area 28</strong>) senses when the secret door to <strong>area 47A</strong> is opened and uses the scrying pool in <strong>area 25</strong> to observe the adventurers as they contend with the cells.</p>
<p>An <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> fills each cell, rendering magic items useless, suppressing ongoing magical effects, and preventing all spellcasting. See the spell&rsquo;s description in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em> for full information.</p>

<p>Waves of heat blast out of this cramped cell. The walls are scribed with relief carvings showing volcanoes setting cities ablaze. Rows of tiny holes are bored into the floor and the ten-foot-high ceiling. A human skeleton embedded in the opposite wall holds an iron sconce with a burning red candle in it.</p>

No keyhole or visible opening mechanism can be found on the secret door. The secret door remains sealed until the characters escape from the cells or die trying.

The lava rains down and magically drains away through the holes in the floor. Each creature in the cell when the lava begins to fall must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that enters the cell for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must repeat the saving throw. Because of the cell&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch>, magic items and spells that provide resistance to fire offer no protection here.</p>

<p>You appear in a cell that smells moldy. Its damp walls are covered with living snails and oysters, and feature sculptural reliefs of tidal waves destroying coastal cities and ships. A merfolk skeleton embedded in one wall clutches an iron sconce fitted with a burning red candle. Suddenly, lukewarm water begins to pour into the cell through rows of tiny holes in the ten-foot-high ceiling.</p>

If the candle is left in its sconce, the rising water extinguishes it on the fourth round. Trying to stuff or block the holes doesn&rsquo;t stop the water from pouring in. Because of the cell&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch>, spells and magic items that enable characters to breathe underwater don&rsquo;t function here.

The first time an oyster or snail is removed from a wall, the cell&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> is dispelled. Eating an oyster teleports a character (along with his or her possessions) to the air cell (<strong>area 47C</strong>), while eating a snail teleports a character (along with his or her possessions) to the earth cell (<strong>area 47D</strong>).</p>

<p>The cell&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> douses magical lights, and nonmagical flames are snuffed out because of the lack of oxygen in the room. Creatures that can see in the dark can see the following:</p>

<p>Any creature that requires air to breathe immediately begins to suffocate unless it took the precaution of holding its breath before teleporting here (see &ldquo;The Environment&rdquo; in chapter 8 of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>).</p>
<p>Any character who cannot see can use an action to blindly search the cell by touch, then make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the check succeeds, the character discerns one key feature of the room: either the wall carvings, the aarakocra skeleton, or the candle.</p>

<p>Any character who searches the cell and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a seam running down the middle of the floor from north to south. The seam suggests the existence of a pit trap.</p>
<h4 id=trap-1>
<a href=#trap-1 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Trap</h4><p>The falling sand fills the room at a rate of 6 inches per round, turning the floor into difficult terrain after 1 round. Any character who can reach the ceiling can use an action to stuff a number of holes with cloth or wax, slowing the sand by 1 inch per round. If the sand reaches a depth of 12 inches, the floor splits open along its seam. When the pit opens, half of the floor swings down to the west and the other half drops to the east, and the sand stops falling. A 6-inch-wide ledge surrounds the pit on all sides. Any creature standing on the floor when it opens must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw; those standing along the walls have advantage on the save. On a successful save, a creature finds purchase on the ledge. A creature that fails the save falls.</p>
<p>The 10-foot-deep pit contains two giant stone rollers with interlocking stone teeth. Anything larger than a grain of sand gets chewed up between these rollers, taking 132 (24d10) force damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is ground to a pulp. A creature that passes through the rollers with at least 1 hit point remaining lands on an iron grate 5 feet below the grinders. A stone button is set into one of the walls above the grate and is visible only to creatures under the rollers. When pressed, the button causes the rollers to stop turning and retract into the walls, allowing creatures that survived the horrid trap to climb out with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>The pit is within the cell&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch>, so spells and magical effects that might otherwise allow a character to survive the rollers or ascend the pit won&rsquo;t work.</p>

A successful check also reveals that the medusa&rsquo;s obsidian pendant is a button. The button won&rsquo;t depress unless the pit is open. A character can try to unlock the button using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check. Pressing the unlocked pendant causes the secret door&rsquo;s lock to release with a dull clunk, after which the door can be swung open to reveal <strong>area 48</strong> beyond. The secret door has springs that cause it to close automatically unless it is held or wedged open. The door locks when it closes and can be opened only from within the cell.</p>

<p>This tomb is filled with terracotta warriors, kneeling in neat ranks around a polished wooden coffin. Between the warriors, four aisles scattered with broken pottery lead up to the coffin, whose painted lid shows a leopard with serpents sprouting from its shoulders.</p>

<p>If intruders are heard within the tomb, the terracotta warriors rise to defend it (see &ldquo;Terracotta Warriors&rdquo; below). To steal Shagambi&rsquo;s treasures, characters must move quietly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nervous Unkh suggests that her host leave the tomb at once using one of the teleportation runes, though she can&rsquo;t decide which rune is best.</li>
<li>Impulsive Wongo thinks it&rsquo;s a good idea to shatter as many terracotta warriors as possible, as quickly as possible.</li>

A detect magic spell or similar effect reveals that each rune has a different aura-strong, steady conjuration magic from the eastern rune; flickering conjuration magic from the northern rune; and a combination of conjuration and transmutation magic from the southern rune.</p>
<p>Whenever a creature teleports into the tomb, roll a d6 to determine which rune it arrives on: 1-2, north rune; 3-4, east rune; 5-6, south rune. If more than one creature is teleported to the same rune, the previous creature is pushed harmlessly off the rune when the new creature appears. Additionally, the north rune is malfunctioning, and any creature arriving there takes 18 (4d8) force damage.</p>
<p>Any creature that moves from outside a rune into its space is instantly teleported to <strong>area 50</strong>. A creature that uses the south rune to teleport is also polymorphed into a random beast, as though it had failed its saving throw against the polymorph spell. Roll a d4 to determine the new form: 1, baboon; 2, bat; 3, flying snake; 4, quipper.</p>

Use animated armor statistics, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each terracotta warrior wields a shortsword. As an action, it can attack twice with the weapon (+4 to hit), dealing 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage on a hit.</li>
<li>If a critical hit is scored against a terracotta warrior, it shatters and is destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The terracotta warriors remain perfectly still and pose no threat as long as the tomb remains relatively quiet. If any character talks loudly, steps on a piece of broken pottery, or makes any other equivalent noise while in the tomb, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the terracotta warriors turn their heads to face you. As one, they pull their swords a few inches from their scabbards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this single warning, the terracotta warriors attack if they hear any other noise. Without the use of magic, any creature walking through the tomb must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check to remain quiet. Moving through pottery shards imposes disadvantage on the check. Once roused into action, the terracotta warriors attack all the creatures in the tomb.</p>

When its lid is opened, a music box inside the coffin is activated, rousing the terracotta warriors if they can hear its haunting melody (even if the adventurers have been silent up to that point). Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check while gently lifting the coffin lid spots the trap&rsquo;s trigger wire, which can then be cut with thieves' tools and a successful DC 12 Dexterity check. The music box is activated on a failed check.</p>
<p>The bones of a kamadan (Shagambi&rsquo;s animal form; see appendix D) are bound in cloth inside the sarcophagus, along with valuables (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>

When Shagambi&rsquo;s spirit manifests, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Six shadowy serpents slither out of the mandolin and coil around your body. You hear a purring voice in your mind say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not your enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Shagambi&rsquo;s card. If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the mandolin and waits for another character to touch it.</p>

Stone Slabs</h3><p>When the characters reach either entrance, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stone slab blocks the end of this corridor. Painted on the slab is the image of a gaunt male humanoid wearing a hooded cloak, its face a mask of stars. The figure&rsquo;s withered left hand is raised with palm extended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stone slabs are impervious to damage and spells, and they are fitted so snugly that even creatures in <wc-fetch type=spell>gaseous form</wc-fetch> can&rsquo;t slip past them. If any character stands in front of a slab and raises his or her left hand with palm extended, both slabs open at the same time, regardless of any efforts taken to prevent them from doing so. When this happens, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The slab sinks into the floor, revealing a dusty passageway beyond. Relief carvings on the walls depict crowds of humanoids fleeing a black star in the sky, with rays of light extending from it to turn those they strike to dust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the stone slabs are raised up to seal off the exits once more (see <strong>area 49C</strong>), characters within the maze see a second image on the inner surface of each slab:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Painted on the inside of the slab is a male humanoid wearing a hooded cloak, once again with stars where his face should be. The figure holds up his right arm, which is severed neatly at the elbow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This image is visible only while the slabs are in their raised positions. From inside the maze, a character can make both slabs sink back down into the floor by standing in front of either slab while holding up his or her right arm-as long as that arm has been severed at the elbow. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how the arm is cut off, but sticking it in the <wc-fetch type=item>sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch> in <strong>area 49B</strong> is one way to do it.</p>

Green Devil Face</h3><blockquote>
<p>A green stone face of devilish countenance protrudes from the wall. The devil&rsquo;s mouth is agape and filled with darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The devil face is 6 feet tall, with a mouth 2 feet in diameter. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic on the face.</p>
<p>The darkness within the mouth is a <wc-fetch type=item>sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch>, which can&rsquo;t be controlled or moved. Any character who stands within 5 feet of the sphere can hear a faint whisper emanating from it. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a character to make out words in Abyssal that translate as follows:</p>

<li>Two bodak magically emerge from the <wc-fetch type=item>sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch> in <strong>area 49B</strong>, seemingly unaffected by it, and begin scouring the maze for prey.

Mirror of Life Trapping</h3><p>Any creature teleported here from <strong>area 48</strong> appears in a random spot near the center of the room and facing west, much to its peril.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This dusty room is fifteen feet square and empty except for an ornate, rectangular mirror mounted on the wall opposite the room&rsquo;s only exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Attached to the west wall with <wc-fetch type=item>sovereign glue</wc-fetch> is a <wc-fetch type=item>mirror of life trapping</wc-fetch>. Any creature within 30 feet of the mirror that sees its reflection must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be imprisoned within one of the mirror&rsquo;s twelve extradimensional cells, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. Constructs automatically succeed on the saving throw.</p>
<p>The mirror currently has three vacant cells. If the mirror traps a creature when its twelve cells are already occupied, it releases one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. The Prisoners of the Mirror table lists the mirror&rsquo;s current prisoners and summarizes how they react if set free or spoken to. Otherwise, roleplay them as you see fit.</p>
<p>The mirror has two command words. Speaking the word &ldquo;Khomara&rdquo; while standing within 5 feet of the mirror deactivates or reactivates it. (The mirror can&rsquo;t trap creatures while deactivated.) Speaking the word &ldquo;Blackfire&rdquo; along with a cell number frees the creature trapped in that cell.</p>
<p>Casting an <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell on the mirror reveals its command words and magical properties. The command words are also written in the spellbook found in <strong>area 28</strong>.</p>

(See chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em> for the mirror&rsquo;s statistics.) Rather than running combat with so many creatures, assume that only the invisible stalker and the troll attack the party initially. The other creatures react to their liberation by turning on one another or running away, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lukanu and Zaal attack the gargoyle, destroying it in 4 rounds, and then help the characters deal with the invisible stalker and the troll.</li>
<li>The stirge attacks A&rsquo;tan, killing him in 1 round. After draining A&rsquo;tan&rsquo;s blood, the stirge flies away to digest its meal.</li>
<li>The doppelganger tries to flee but doesn&rsquo;t go far, hoping that the characters survive and returning to thank them if they prevail.</li>
<li>Tlad Xolbrys uses his magic to help the characters unless it looks like they&rsquo;re near defeat, whereupon the drow turns against them.</li>

Ghastly Door</h3><blockquote>
<p>What appears to be a large stone door looms at the end of the hallway, but it bears no handles or hinges. Jutting from the wall on either side of the door are two matching bronze sculptures-each the head and neck of a serpent with fangs bared. On the lintel above the door is inscribed the following message in Common:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warm like flame, cold for the cruel, still for the dead, gruel for the ghoul.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stench of rotting flesh wafts from the bronze serpents. Close examination reveals dried blood in each statue&rsquo;s mouth and tiny tubes at the back of its neck. The tubes extend into secret rooms on either side of the door, where six ghast are confined (three per room).</p>
<p>The stone door opens when a pint or more of fresh blood is poured into the mouth of each bronze serpent. The blood drips into the chambers holding the ghasts, driving them into a slurping frenzy that can be heard through the serpents' open mouths. Once sated with blood, the ghasts yank chains to hoist the door open.</p>
<p>The door weighs 1,000 pounds and can be lifted by characters with a combined Strength of 33 or more. If the characters do so, secret doors on either side of the hallway behind the door unlock and slide open. This releases the hungry ghasts, which fight until turned or destroyed. Each locked secret door can be opened with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or forced open by a character who succeeds on a DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>

Throne Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>This vaulted chamber features a ten-foot-deep sunken floor surrounded by ledges without railings. Alcoves along the ledges hold painted wooden statues of hornet-headed humanoid warriors, each wearing a grass skirt and clutching a spear.</p>
<p>A gruesome throne lashed together of bone and strips of skin stands atop the west ledge. A fearsome horned skull surmounts the throne, and small skulls are piled around it. The seat of the throne appears to be made of stretched skin and has a metal scepter resting on it.</p>
<p>Shuffling about the sunken portion of the room are three gaunt humanoid figures in dusty robes draped in cobwebs, their eyes and mouths stitched shut. Armed with brushes and clay pots of pigment, they paint the walls and pillars with grim, poorly rendered illustrations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four pillars support the ceiling, which is 15 feet above the ledges and 25 feet above the sunken floor. The wooden statues are harmless (their spears are merely decorative) and weigh 150 pounds each.</p>

Despite their blindness, each has the magical ability to perceive and paint scenes of pain, carnage, and death that have occurred in the Tomb of the Nine Gods.</p>
<p>One of the artists is presently painting over scenes depicting the fall of the Company of the Yellow Banner. All that remains is an image of a human male (the late Lord Brixton, whose remains can be found in <strong>area 63</strong>) choking on poisonous gas. The other two artists are in the process of painting images that capture the player characters' harrowing exploits in the tomb thus far. (Choose memorable moments in which one or more party members were badly wounded or killed.)</p>

<p>The undead artists have the statistics of zombie, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of darkvision, each artist has blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. The artists are blind beyond this radius and immune to the <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch> condition.</li>
<li>They have no effective attacks and are worth 0 XP.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters turn or destroy any of the artists, a tyrannosaurus zombie bursts up from a cavity beneath the floor and attacks, leaving a 20-foot diameter hole and shattered floor tiles behind. While it&rsquo;s too big to squeeze down any 5-foot-wide corridors, it can easily traverse the wider passageway to the east.</p>

The skull atop the throne once belonged to a minotaur guardian of Omu named Karagos. Any creature that touches the skull or sits in the throne must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become cursed with the Rage of Karagos. When cursed, the creature gains 50 temporary hit points and goes berserk. Until the curse is lifted, the victim is forced to attack the nearest creature it can see with melee attacks. It can&rsquo;t make ranged attacks or cast spells, and if it can&rsquo;t see any creatures to attack, it does nothing. The curse ends if the berserk creature drops to 0 hit points, or if a <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> spell is cast on it.

<p>The walls of this room are adorned with tile mosaics of a jungle city intermingled with frescoes of flowering plants, birds, insects, and humans wearing gold skirts and carrying spears and ornate jugs. The ceiling is painted to look like a clear blue sky. A small bejeweled cockroach rests atop a sarcophagus of black basalt in the middle of the room. A two-foot-diameter orb hanging from a chain above the sarcophagus is made of hammered gold to resemble a smiling sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Acererak slew the trickster gods of Omu and enslaved the city, Napaka, the city&rsquo;s elderly queen, chose not to flee, and instead offered herself as a sacrifice in exchange for the release of her people. Acererak was impressed by the queen&rsquo;s courage-not enough to spare her life or honor her request, but enough to place her in a special crypt.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals auras of evocation magic around the golden sun and the bejeweled cockroach (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The lid of the black sarcophagus bears a name etched in Common: NAPAKA. The lid is sealed with strips of melted lead that can be easily pried away. Once the lead is removed, the lid can be pushed aside with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The interior of the sarcophagus is lined with lead and contains several treasures (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>

Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. This effect ends if all creatures leave the affected area.</p>
<p>The first time the queen&rsquo;s remains or any of her treasures are removed from the sarcophagus, the sun&rsquo;s expression turns angry as it emits rays of searing light. Each creature within 30 feet of the sun that doesn&rsquo;t have total cover against it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a ray, which deals 42 (12d6) fire damage.</p>

It weighs 5 pounds and contains two items: a small jade key shaped like a crocodile (designed to fit in the keyhole in <strong>area 62B</strong>) and a <wc-fetch type=item>necklace of fireballs</wc-fetch> with eight beads remaining. Acererak placed a curse on the necklace, which can be revealed by an <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>When any creature dons the cursed necklace, all its beads detonate at once. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the exploding necklace must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wearer of the necklace fails the saving throw automatically. A <wc-fetch type=spell>remove curse</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic removes the curse from the necklace.</p>

She wears the tattered remnants of a black gown and a hornet mask made of painted gold (250 gp).</p>
<p>In her left hand, Napaka holds an iron scepter with an adamantine head, which is lighter than it appears (5 pounds). A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the scepter, which can be used to destroy the stone juggernaut in <strong>area 62</strong>. Casting an <wc-fetch type=spell>identify</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>legend lore</wc-fetch>, or similar spell on the scepter reveals that its singular purpose is to destroy a construct named after Napaka.</p>
<p>If the scepter is removed and not immediately replaced with its nonmagical twin from <strong>area 52</strong>, or if Napaka&rsquo;s remains are removed from their resting place, the queen&rsquo;s corpse opens its mouth in a wide yawn and exhales a baleful black gas that fills a 15-foot cube centered on it.

If a <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> spell is cast on her corpse, the characters can ask it questions about Omu and receive honest answers. Napaka came to believe that the gods of Omu were not truly divine beings but rather trickster spirits that had fooled the Omuan people into worshiping them. The queen remembers Acererak killing the trickster gods and enslaving the Omuans, but she knows nothing about the Tomb of the Nine Gods, which was built after her death. She knows that a few members of the royal family fled Omu, but she is unaware that the aarakocra are sheltering her great-grandchildren at Kir Sabal. Napaka knows that her grandmother, ZalkorÃ©, languishes in the ruins of Nangalore.</p>
<p>Even in death, Napaka pines for Omu to be reborn and repopulated. However, what she desires above all is the destruction of Acererak.</p>

Rolling Doom</h3><blockquote>
<p>After ten feet, this dusty corridor becomes a staircase that descends fifteen feet to a lower tunnel. Resting on the floor at the bottom of the staircase is an old treasure chest with a rusty built-in lock. Just beyond the chest, the tunnel opens up to a huge, dark chamber.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chest (<strong>area 54A</strong>) is the trigger for a trap. When the chest or its lid is lifted, a heavy stone ball (<strong>area 54B</strong>) tumbles down the stairs. Adventurers fleeing the stone ball stumble into a hidden pit (<strong>area 54C</strong>).</p>

Treasure Chest</h3><p>The lock on the chest can be picked with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools. Within the chest is an invisible key, 3 inches long and made of brass. Any character who manually searches inside the chest feels the key, which unlocks the clock in <strong>area 56</strong>.</p>
<p>If the chest is smashed by the granite ball (see below), the invisible key is lost in the wreckage but can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect also reveals the presence of the key, either in the chest or among the wreckage. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 14) cast on the key renders it visible.</p>

Granite Ball</h3><p>A 5-foot-diameter sphere of solid granite balances within a secret compartment at the top of the stairs. Finding the compartment requires that a character search the tunnel ceiling and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The hatch can be jammed with an iron spike or with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools.</p>
<p>When released, the stone ball thunders down the stairs and tumbles into the pit at 54C. Any character on the stairs or in the tunnel below can stay ahead of the ball by running toward the pit. A character can also leap over the ball with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Any character who fails the check or can&rsquo;t move out of the ball&rsquo;s way is struck for 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and knocked prone.

Acid Pit</h3><p>The walls of this 10-foot-deep pit are lined with thick glass, and the pit is filled with green acid to a depth of 5 feet. The pit&rsquo;s lid is crafted of interlocking stone tiles that fall apart beneath 100 pounds or more of weight. Any character who searches the floor notices the unusual stonework and smells the acid below with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p>A creature in the area of the pit when the floor collapses can avoid a fall and grab the edge of the pit with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the character was unaware of the pit. Any creature that enters the acid for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 66 (12d10) acid damage. The walls of the pit are too smooth to climb without the aid of magic or climbing gear.</p>
<p>The pit&rsquo;s acid can be safely contained in glass vials if the characters have any at hand, and can then be used as the acid in chapter 5, &ldquo;Equipment,&rdquo; of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p>

<p>Four marble columns support the ceiling of this grand tomb. Twin staircases ascend to an upper gallery, where a carving in the form of a giant maze adorns the wall. On the floor of the tomb stands an opaque crystal sarcophagus that is constantly changing color. Minotaur murals adorn the walls on the lower level of the tomb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The walls of the tomb are lined with secret doors that slide open to reveal chambers strewn with minotaur bones-ten chambers in all. One of these chambers has a hallway at the back of it leading to <strong>area 56</strong>.</p>

<li>Fickle I&rsquo;jin suggests waiting for the sarcophagus to turn gold before trying to open it. (Gold is I&rsquo;jin&rsquo;s favorite color.)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The intricate carving shifts before your eyes, its configuration ever-changing. The maze has no exits, and its corridors are lit by tiny torches and clouded by fog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any non-undead creature that touches the wall carving vanishes and reappears in a demiplanar maze, the configuration of which matches that of the carving. The first time this happens, all the secret doors slide open as the minotaur bones knit together, forming ten minotaur skeleton that emerge from their chambers and attack anyone in the tomb. All creatures present should roll initiative, including anyone trapped in the maze. The keys to open Unkh&rsquo;s sarcophagus are hidden in the maze.</p>
<p>When a character arrives in the maze, describe it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You stand within a fifteen-foot-high passageway walled by smooth, featureless stone, which is lit by torches and shrouded by fog. There&rsquo;s no ceiling, and when you look up, you see a distorted view of the room you left behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters standing near the wall carving can see characters trapped in the maze but can&rsquo;t hear them. Similarly, characters in the maze can see giant, distorted versions of any creatures standing within 10 feet of the wall carving, but they can&rsquo;t hear anything outside the maze.</p>
<p>The configuration of the maze constantly changes to ensure that characters within it remain separated and unable to find each other. Visibility within the maze is limited to 20 feet because of the churning fog. Spells that are altered within the tomb are similarly altered in the maze (see <em>&ldquo;Spell Restrictions&rdquo;</em>).</p>
<p>The walls of the maze can be climbed with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Any character who climbs to the top of the walls or flies beyond them is expelled from the maze, taking 22 (5d8) force damage and reappearing with a loud pop in an unoccupied space near the wall carving.</p>

The keyhole does not penetrate to the interior of the sarcophagus, and there are no mechanisms within it to pick or disarm. The sarcophagus is impervious to damage and spells.</p>
<p>The crystal sarcophagus changes color every 6 seconds, shifting through the following repeating cycle: blue, gold, purple, green, red, black. If a crystal key claimed from the maze is inserted into the keyhole when the sarcophagus and the key are the same color, the sarcophagus lid disappears, and the contents of the sarcophagus are revealed (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). At the same time, the character who retrieved the key from the maze receives a supernatural gift from a mysterious benefactor (see &ldquo;Acererak&rsquo;s Gift&rdquo; below).</p>

Any creature within 30 feet of the clock when it strikes the top of the hour must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or age by ten years.

<blockquote>
<p>You arrive in a room half-filled with rotting corpses. Protruding from one wall is a large green devil&rsquo;s face, its flared nostrils set just above the putrescent mass. A sconce above the face holds a flickering torch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The torch burns with a <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spell, illuminating the humanoid corpses that fill the room to a depth of 6 feet and make the area difficult terrain. As needed, Acererak&rsquo;s magic draws new corpses here from graveyards across the world, all in various states of decay.</p>
<p>An otyugh feeds on the corpses and is presently buried under the heap in the southwest corner. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the creature&rsquo;s eyestalk poking up above the reeking mass. The otyugh eagerly attacks a lone character but avoids confrontations with multiple enemies. Once killed, the otyugh is not replaced.</p>

Any close inspection reveals that its nostrils contain hollow cavities, each one containing a stone lever. A pulled lever locks into place and can&rsquo;t be moved until it resets.</p>
<p>Pulling the lever in the left nostril causes the mouth of the devil face to open wide, revealing a gullet filled with impenetrable darkness that pulls in everything in the room. Initiative should be rolled for all creatures in the area. Any creature that starts its turn in the room and isn&rsquo;t secured in some fashion must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled into the gullet and destroyed. If a character fails the saving throw, another character within reach, or any character bound to the first character by a rope, can use his or her reaction to grab on and grant the first character a reroll. After 1 minute, the lever resets with an audible clunk. The gullet remains open until the lever resets. Magic has no effect on the gullet or the darkness within.</p>
<p>Pulling the lever in the right nostril causes the devil&rsquo;s eyes to glow red as all living creatures in the room (including the otyugh, if it&rsquo;s still alive) are teleported in front of the devil face at <strong>area 5B</strong>, along with whatever they are wearing or carrying. The lever then resets.</p>
<p>If the characters return to this room at a later time, the effects of the levers are reversed.</p>

Cog of Rot</h3><blockquote>
<p>A pungent stench fills this pentagonal room, the walls of which are covered with riveted sheets of iron. A wild garden full of sickly plants and rotting compost takes up most of the interior, and a narrow path hugs the walls between two exits. Jutting from the middle of the garden is a six-foot-tall rusty sprinkler. In the ceiling above the sprinkler, a ten-foot-wide shaft leads straight up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever this room is rotated by the controls in <strong>area 61</strong>, the sprinkler draws water from the underground lake (<strong>area 65</strong>) to spray the plants in the room. Magic keeps the plants alive despite the lack of sunlight.</p>
<p>If the cogs are turned so that one of the doorways lines up with <strong>area 63</strong> to the north, gas from that area billows into the garden and transforms random piles of compost into three shambling mound, which rise up and attack any other creatures in the room. After 1 hour, the shambling mounds revert to dead compost.</p>
<p>The shaft in the ceiling ascends 15 feet to <strong>area 45</strong>. To scale the smooth walls of the shaft, a character needs a climbing gear or magic.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Gouts of acid are meant to rain down from the mouths of the dragon friezes whenever this room is rotated by the controls in <strong>area 61</strong>, but the acid compartments in the ceiling are currently empty.

Cog of Blood</h3><blockquote>
<p>Five teak wardrobes stand against the ironclad walls of this chamber, each with a door bearing a carved image or scene. Puddles of gray slime cover parts of the floor. The room has two exits, including an adamantine portcullis blocking a passage to the north. Set into a metal plate above the portcullis is a row of five red crystals shaped like drops of blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adamantine portcullis is impervious to damage and spells, and its bars are spaced 4 inches apart. A Tiny or gaseous creature can slip between the bars easily.</p>
<p>To raise the portcullis, monsters from all five wardrobes must be summoned and slain in this room. Only one wardrobe can be opened at a time, and until that wardrobe&rsquo;s monsters are defeated, all other wardrobes in the room are sealed and unopenable. When all of a wardrobe&rsquo;s monsters die, the wardrobe disappears and one of the red crystals above the portcullis lights up. When all five crystals are lit, the portcullis rises and remains up for 24 hours. Once this duration ends, the portcullis lowers back into place, the crystals go dark, and the wardrobes reappear with their doors closed.</p>
<p>Each wardrobe contains a one-way gate to another plane, which deactivates if the wardrobe is removed from this chamber or destroyed. Any creature attempting to pass through a wardrobe&rsquo;s gate from this side is forced back and cannot enter.</p>
<p>Each wardrobe weighs 250 pounds, stands 6Â½ feet tall, and radiates an aura of conjuration magic to a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect. A wardrobe is a Medium object with AC 11, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>

If pulled to the down position, the lever locks in place and aboleth slime (see <em>&ldquo;Aboleth Slime,"</em>) begins to pour into the room through the iron pipes above the wall engraving. If the pipes are plugged with cloth before the lever is pulled, the slime is prevented from flowing into the room, but the pipes can&rsquo;t be stuffed while slime is pouring out of them.</p>
<p>The slime covers the floor to a depth of 1 inch per round. If the crawlway to <strong>area 70</strong> is exposed (see &ldquo;Concealed Crawlway&rdquo; above), the slime does not accumulate in the room and instead pours into the crawlspace.</p>
<p>The lever&rsquo;s locking mechanism can be released with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools. If released, the lever automatically shifts to the up position, shutting the valves in the pipes and stopping the flow of slime. The lever can be torn from the console with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, which has the same effect.</p>
<p>The gold lever has another function, which is revealed in <strong>area 67</strong>.</p>
<h5 id=red-button>

Any creature in the doorway when the wall drops must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to one side of the barrier or the other (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is pinned under the wall, falls prone, and takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage. A pinned creature is restrained, can&rsquo;t stand up, and takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns until it crawls out from under the door or another creature pulls it free, either of which requires an action and a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. The iron wall remains locked in place for 1 hour, after which it rises back into the ceiling on its own. It can&rsquo;t be lifted or pried open, though a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell causes it to retract into the ceiling. While the iron wall is down, pushing the red button has no effect.</p>

Turning the dial to the left establishes a two-way telepathic link between the creatures in this room and the aboleth in <strong>area 65</strong>. Turning the dial to the right ends the link. The telepathic link to the aboleth also ends for any creature that leaves the control room. Because the communication is telepathic, all participants can understand one another even if they don&rsquo;t speak the same language. Roleplay the aboleth using the information in <strong>area 65</strong>.</p>
<p>The aboleth is accustomed to speaking only with Withers and refers to the wight by his original name of Gorra. If the characters activate the telepathic link, the first thought the aboleth sends is an exasperated, &ldquo;What now, Gorra?&rdquo; Once the aboleth realizes it&rsquo;s telepathically linked to strangers, it wants to know all about them for no reason other than to satisfy its curiosity.</p>

Broken Statue</h3><p>The hallway comes to a dead end 15 feet beyond the purple drape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A six-foot-tall statue of a leering four-armed gargoyle stands against the back wall. One of its arms has broken off and lies on the floor in front of it, its hand curled into a tight fist. The other three arms have their clawed hands open in such a way as to suggest they&rsquo;re meant to hold something. Carved into the wall above the statue is a riddle:</p>
<p>Three I need</p>
<p>Then three more</p>
<p>Three more still</p>
<p>Opens the door</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gargoyle statue is impervious to damage and spells, but its broken-off arm is not. If three gemstones are placed in the three open hands of the statue, the hands magically close into fists that crush the gemstones to powder. The statue&rsquo;s hands then open again. If this exercise is performed twice more, so that nine gemstones in total are crushed, the hand of the broken-off arm opens and a fist-sized ruby appears in it. The ruby is the Eye of Zaltec, which is teleported from <strong>area 62D</strong> by the sacrifice of the gems. If the ruby is plucked from the gargoyle&rsquo;s hand, the statue magically opens its mouth and exhales a cloud of soporific gas that fills the eastern 15 feet of the hall. At the same time, the secret door at the west end of the hallway slides open, and the stone juggernaut in <strong>area 62D</strong> rolls down the corridor.</p>
<p>Each creature in the gas cloud that is not immune to the poisoned condition must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 hour. The effect ends on a creature that takes damage.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of this room is taken up by Acererak&rsquo;s stone juggernaut. The archlich named the juggernaut after Napaka, a dead Omuan queen (see <strong>area 53</strong>).

<blockquote>
<p>The wall at the west end of the hall slides back to reveal a stone juggernaut on rollers. The construct fills the height and width of the hall and barrels toward you at alarming speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All creatures present must roll initiative. On its turn, the juggernaut rolls down the hallway, making a Slam attack against any creature standing in its way and using its Devastating Roll feature to crush small or prone enemies. When no enemies are left alive, it returns to the secret room. The juggernaut can&rsquo;t fit into any space less than 10 feet wide, and it doesn&rsquo;t have room in the hallway to turn. It attacks by rolling forward and backward.</p>
<p>Hidden in the tomb of the real Napaka (<strong>area 53</strong>) is a magic scepter, the adamantine head of which reduces the juggernaut to 0 hit points and turns it to dust on contact. While the juggernaut is inert, no attack roll is needed to strike it with the scepter. If the juggernaut has been awakened, a character can use the scepter to make a melee weapon attack against the juggernaut, reducing it to 0 hit points and turning it to dust on a hit.</p>

<p>Thick green gas billows out of skull-shaped nozzles set into the walls of this cramped room. A rotting corpse clad in studded leather armor lies on the floor, mouth open and hands grasping its throat. Wrapped around one of its arms is a yellow band.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The green gas that fills this room fills <strong>area 58</strong> when the two rooms are open to each other, but the gas is too heavy to rise up the shaft in <strong>area 58</strong>. The gas has two effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>It transforms the dead vegetation in <strong>area 58</strong> into three shambling mounds (see that area for details).</li>
<li>It is poisonous to non-plants. Any creature susceptible to the gas that starts its turn in a gas-filled area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature is affected even if it holds its breath or doesn&rsquo;t need to breathe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuffing the nozzles with cloth prevents more gas from spilling into the room. If the characters block the flow of gas, the lingering gas disperses after 1 minute.</p>

Underground Lake</h3><blockquote>
<p>A dark underground lake opens up before you, its ceiling festooned with chains and gears-some of which appear to have dwarves dangling from them. A gigantic motionless stone cog rises from the water, with two matching cogs connected to it. Rusty metal conduits stretch from the cavern walls to the cogs. The water of the lake is slimy, with pinpricks of phosphorescent light twinkling in the murk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cavern ceiling is 20 feet above the foul surface of the lake, which is 20 feet deep. Any creature that drinks the water is poisoned until it regurgitates the liquid, which happens automatically in 1d4 minutes. The lights at the bottom of the lake are phosphorescent crab that feed on the muck. Each crab sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius but stops glowing 10 minutes after being removed from the water.</p>
<p>The three stone cogs of areas 58 to 60 are half-submerged in the water and rise 10 feet above its surface. Their uneven upper surfaces are difficult terrain, and their smooth outer walls can&rsquo;t be scaled without climbing gear or magic.</p>
<p>The Mechanus chain (<strong>area 69</strong>) drives the machinery in this cavern, feeding power to the Soulmonger and to the many traps and other mechanisms within the dungeon. At any given time, 1d4+1 tomb dwarves in leather harnesses dangle from the ceiling while performing routine maintenance on the gears and giant cogs. Each tomb dwarf has the statistics of a wight, except that it wields a battleaxe and a light crossbow. The tomb dwarves ignore intruders unless they are attacked, in which case they defend themselves with their crossbows.</p>

When Acererak enslaved it, the aboleth lost its mind and developed a split personality. Its dominant aspect awaits the coming of the death god, which it believes heralds the fall of divinity. Until that day, the aboleth humbly obeys Withers (whom the creature refers to by his original name of Gorra) and attacks anyone seeking to prevent the atropal&rsquo;s ascension. The aboleth&rsquo;s other personality is that of a humanoid child-harmless, gleeful, and insanely curious. In this state of mind, the aboleth poses no threat to anyone and flees if attacked. Roll any die to determine which personality is dominant at any given time. On an even result, the aboleth&rsquo;s childlike personality is dominant.</p>
<p>If the characters explore the lake using the rowboats in <strong>area 66</strong>, the aboleth ignores them regardless of its current demeanor, unless they draw undue attention to themselves. In the event of combat, the aboleth is not the master of the lake and has no lair actions as a result.</p>
<p>Ancient beyond reckoning, G&rsquo;lyh&rsquo;rul has accumulated tens of thousands of years of knowledge. If the characters establish telepathic communication with the aboleth and it is inclined to speak to them, it can provide information as if the characters had cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>commune</wc-fetch> spell. (Since they&rsquo;re not actually casting the spell, this effect is not subject to the restrictions on spellcasting within the Tomb of the Nine Gods.) After sharing this information, the aboleth grows bored and withdraws to a dark corner of the lake to dream of evil things.</p>

Door of Devouring</h3><p>If the characters approach this area by way of the spiral staircase (<strong>area 26</strong>), read the following when they reach the bottom of the stairs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the bottom of the staircase, a dark corridor leads south, while a stone door with iron hinges and a brass knob stands to the east.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters approach this area from the lake, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A worked stone column stretches from the bottom of the lake to the cavern roof and is attached to the nearby wall by a stone conduit. On one side of the column, steps of moss-covered stone climb from a stone dock to a landing whose stone door shows no handles or hinges. Ropes lash a pair of rowboats to a dock post, and a rusty iron cage wallows in the slime, held afloat by chain and winch. Phosphorescent crabs gather at the bottom of the lake below the cage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stone door separating the mooring area from the spiral staircase (<strong>area 26</strong>) radiates auras of abjuration, conjuration, and illusion to a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect. The door can be opened easily from the west side simply by pulling on the brass knob. The door is much harder to open from the east side.</p>

If any character touches or inspects the door, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A monstrous mouth forms on the door&rsquo;s surface, calling out with a deep drawl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry I could eat you alive, but I&rsquo;ll settle for somethin' else. Somethin' livin'. Somethin' light!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mouth is similar to that created by a <wc-fetch type=spell>magic mouth</wc-fetch> spell, but more powerful. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 19) cast on the door suppresses its magic for 10 minutes, preventing the mouth from forming. However, the door cannot be opened without the mouth except from the west side, not even with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>The mouth isn&rsquo;t programmed to say anything else, but its words (and the crab shells underfoot) provide the characters with a clue regarding how to open the door. If the mouth is offered a live phosphorescent crab, it opens wide, chomps down to consume the crab, then spits out its crushed shell. Once the mouth has been fed, it disappears and the door into <strong>area 26</strong> swings open. The door locks and the spell resets if the door is closed again.</p>
<p>If a character tosses anything into the mouth that isn&rsquo;t a phosphorescent crab, the mouth spits it out. If the character is within 10 feet of the door when this happens, the door wraps its tongue around the character and swallows the character whole. No attack roll or saving throw is required. A character &ldquo;devoured&rdquo; in this manner is teleported to <strong>area 57</strong>.</p>

The cage radiates transmutation magic to a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect, and bestows the effect of a <wc-fetch type=spell>water breathing</wc-fetch> spell on any creatures within it. The stout bars grant half cover against attacks originating from outside the cage.</p>
<p>Using the winch, a character on the steps can lower the cage 20 feet to the lakebed, allowing characters in the cage to easily harvest 2d6 phosphorescent crab from the muck.</p>
<p>The creaking descent of the cage draws the attention of the aboleth in <strong>area 65</strong>. If the aboleth&rsquo;s crueler personality is dominant, it attempts to enslave any characters in the cage. If it succeeds, it sends them back to the surface with orders to entice others down into the depths. If the aboleth&rsquo;s childlike personality is dominant, it swims over and uses its telepathy to strike up a friendly conversation with the divers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A life-size golden statue of a mastodon stands atop a one-foot-high stone cog at the center of this room. Jeweled tusks sweep from its jowls, and its trunk is raised in a roar. Inscriptions coil around the statue&rsquo;s body, and murals on the walls show a Chultan warrior riding a living mastodon through a series of hellish landscapes. In each scene, a different breed of devil assails them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The murals on the walls tell the story of Ch&rsquo;gakare (pronounced chuh-GAH-kah-ree), a Chultan warrior who stole his king&rsquo;s prized steed: a mastodon named Ghom. As punishment, the king&rsquo;s sorcerers banished Ch&rsquo;gakare and Ghom to the Nine Hells, but the two fought their way back home. On his return, Ch&rsquo;gakare chopped off the king&rsquo;s head and turned his skull into a jeweled chalice. Any character who studies the murals and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the legend and can recount it. The murals show Ch&rsquo;gakare and Ghom fighting spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, horned devils, and erinyes.</p>

The statue&rsquo;s lifelike qualities owe to the fact that this is Ghom, whose body was preserved in magical iron and covered with a thin layer of hammered gold, and whose tusks have been set with gems (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The inscriptions on the statue are written in Old Omuan. They read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let your bones watch over my treasure, brave Ghom. As you carried me from the inferno, so shall I rise from death to defend my riches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scratches on the floor beneath the stone cog indicate that it can rotate, yet no amount of pressure budges it. Any search of the top of the statue reveals a star-shaped indentation on the back of its head. Those who have seen the gold lever in <strong>area 61</strong> recognize the lever&rsquo;s star-shaped handle as a perfect match. If the lever is claimed and set head-first into the indentation, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thunderous trumpeting sound erupts from the mastodon&rsquo;s trunk, causing a block of stone to seal off the room. The cog under the mastodon&rsquo;s feet then begins to revolve, letting the statue face each of the murals in turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The block of stone fills the space in the hallway indicated on map 5.5. Any creature under the block when it falls must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature moves out of the block&rsquo;s way in whichever direction it prefers. On a failed save, the creature takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. If this damage reduces the creature&rsquo;s hit points to 0, the creature is crushed to a pulp; otherwise, it is shoved into the room. When the mastodon statue begins to revolve, all creatures present should roll initiative. The statue turns counterclockwise and completes one 360-degree revolution on initiative count 0 of each round.</p>
<p>When the statue completes its first revolution, magical fire engulfs the floor and the cog, flaring up 6 feet high. Any creature that enters the fire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. Any character perched on the golden mastodon is shielded from the flames. Up to six Medium creatures can perch on the mastodon at once-four on its back and one on each of its curved tusks.</p>
<p>Each time the statue turns to face north, one or more devils emerge from the murals and attack all other creatures in the room. Roll initiative for each group of new arrivals. Each magically summoned devil vanishes in a puff of smoke when it drops to 0 hit points or when there are no creatures left to attack. The devils appear in the following order, emerging from the walls wherever you see fit:</p>
<p>Round 2: Four spined devil</p>
<p>Round 3: Three bearded devil</p>
<p>Round 4: Two barbed devil</p>
<p>Round 5: One horned devil</p>
<p>Round 6: One erinyes</p>

A character who offers his or her soul to the erinyes is destroyed by fire. The character&rsquo;s soul becomes trapped in the Soulmonger, the character&rsquo;s belongings are left behind, and all remaining devils in the room disappear in clouds of smoke.</p>

When this happens, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fires go out, though smoke still hangs in the air. A warm wind blows through the hall, carrying the scent of jasmine, frankincense, and grave dust. The smoke coalesces into a decayed warrior wrapped in bandages. He holds up a gruesome chalice made from a human skull.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The undead warrior is Ch&rsquo;gakare, barely recognizable as the man riding the mastodon in the wall murals. He has the statistics of a revenant, but he can&rsquo;t be destroyed. If reduced to 0 hit points, Ch&rsquo;gakare turns to smoke, vanishes, and reforms in his tomb somewhere in the distant jungle.</p>
<p>Ch&rsquo;gakare does not speak but holds up the chalice in a manner that suggests he&rsquo;s offering it as a gift. If the chalice is taken from his hand, Ch&rsquo;gakare turns to smoke and is gone. The stone block that seals off the room retracts into the ceiling when Ch&rsquo;gakare disappears.</p>

Multiple characters working together can shorten the time proportionately. Fifty gemstones (100 gp each) can also be pried loose from the mastodon&rsquo;s tusks.</p>
<p>Ch&rsquo;gakare&rsquo;s gift is the fabled Skull Chalice of Ch&rsquo;gakare. This item is worth 2,500 gp but can fetch up to four times that value if sold at auction in any major city.

<p>Graven images of rotting corpses decorate this hall, and the floor is littered with tarnished coins, pieces of armor, broken shields, axe heads, and other bits of scrap metal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All nonmagical objects made of cloth, leather, wood, or metal that enter this corridor instantly decay or corrode to the point of being useless and worthless. Clothing and armor falls apart, shields and weapons become brittle and ineffective, and so forth. A <wc-fetch type=spell>mending</wc-fetch> spell cannot repair an object damaged in this fashion.</p>
<p>An archway stands at the west end of the hall, through which characters can see into <strong>area 69</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This yawning archway has a keystone adorned with an iron bull&rsquo;s skull, which bites down on an ivory ring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of necromancy magic emanating from the ivory ring. If the ring is yanked from the skull&rsquo;s jaws, it disintegrates and the destructive effect in the hallway ends.</p>

Mechanus Chain</h3><blockquote>
<p>Hot wind tinged with the smell of burning oil blows down a forty-foot-diameter vertical shaft. Stone balconies protrude from the walls on opposite sides of this expanse, with the west balcony fifteen feet higher than the east one. Two thick chains rattle in the gulf between the balconies-one ascending two hundred feet before disappearing into a cloudy vortex lit by arcs of purple lightning; the other wrapping around an enormous metal gear floating one hundred feet below. Another hundred feet below the gear, a second vortex rages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To drive his infernal machinery, Acererak contaminated a workforce of modrons from the plane of Mechanus. Under the stewardship of a corrupt pentadrone, the modrons rerouted one of their great chains into the tomb. The sections of the shaft above and below the balconies exist outside of normal space, preventing the shaft from intersecting with the tomb&rsquo;s other levels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A rip forms in the vortex high above, and nine cubeshaped creatures with wings and shortbows fly through. They are quickly followed by a large crystal decahedron that holds a weird starfish-shaped creature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pentadrone leads a squad of nine quadrone through the upper planar vortex, which allows safe passage into the shaft but not out of it. Knowing that they cannot return to Mechanus, the modrons fight until destroyed. Once these modrons are dealt with, the shaft becomes undefended. No other modrons are sent through the vortex.</p>
<p>The pentadrone can&rsquo;t fly on its own, but it gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover while encased in the crystal decahedron, which grants its occupant total cover against attacks that originate outside the vehicle. The pentadrone can&rsquo;t make melee attacks through the decahedron, but it can use a bonus action to open a small hole in any of the decahedron&rsquo;s facets in order to spray creatures with its paralysis gas.</p>
<p>The decahedron has AC 16, 50 hit points, immunity to poison damage, resistance to piercing and slashing damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, the crystal decahedron shatters and the pentadrone falls.</p>
<p>The crystal decahedron has enough room to accommodate one Small or Medium creature in addition to the pentadrone if a character thinks to enter the vehicle using <wc-fetch type=spell>misty step</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>dimension door</wc-fetch>, or similar magic. Inside the vehicle, the pentadrone can attack as normal. When the pentadrone dies, the decahedron shatters.</p>

With a successful check, a character learns the appropriate lore and all lore with a lower DC:</p>
<p><strong>DC 10:</strong> Planar vortices are incredibly destructive. No one can expect to enter a vortex and survive.</p>
<p><strong>DC 15:</strong> The chain is called a Mechanus chain. Such chains are crafted by modrons and used in conjunction with other machinery to keep the plane of Mechanus in working order.</p>
<p><strong>DC 20:</strong> This Mechanus chain has been repurposed for the tomb. One chain would be enough to keep the tomb&rsquo;s traps and other mechanisms in working order.</p>
<p><strong>DC 25:</strong> Destroying a Mechanus chain requires the casting of three wish spells.</p>

Any creature in the shaft that enters a planar vortex is torn apart, its body and possessions scattered across the multiverse.</p>
<p>The Mechanus chain forms a loop in constant motion. One part of the chain descends at a rate of 50 feet per round, wrapping around the giant gear that floats 100 feet below the east balcony, while the other part of the chain climbs to enter the upper vortex at the same rate.</p>
<p>The two balconies are separated by a 15-foot-wide gulf, through which jangling chain links rise and fall. Magic that allows characters to fly or to walk on walls makes it easy to cross from one balcony to the other. Any character who moves at least 10 feet beforehand can jump from the west balcony to the east balcony. Because the west balcony is 15 feet higher than its eastern counterpart, a character must either pole vault across the gap (using a 10-foot pole or similar item) or use magic. A character can also cross the expanse by leaping from one balcony to the nearest chain, from that chain to the other, and finally to the opposite balcony. Each of these jumps requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Any character who fails a check made to jump to a balcony or chain falls down the shaft and into the lower planar vortex unless somehow halted. A falling character can land on the floating gear 100 feet below with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw but takes falling damage as normal.</p>

Carvings of tall, headless humanoids decorate the walls of the room.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When a creature sits on the armillary chair, the globe closes again. Any attempt to prevent that closing overloads the mechanism; until the blockage is removed, any creature within 5 feet of the armillary sphere that isn&rsquo;t seated on the chair takes 18 (4d8) lightning damage.</p>
<p>When the creature seated on the chair stands up, the globe&rsquo;s hatch opens, closing again only when another creature sits on the chair or when there are no creatures within 5 feet of the armillary sphere.</p>
<p>While the globe is sealed, the character sitting in the chair can see through the globe as if it were made of transparent glass. Pulling the levers at the end of each armrest causes the armillary sphere&rsquo;s rings to spin the representations of the sun, the moon, and other planetary bodies in one direction or the other.</p>

The first time a creature inside the armillary sphere reorients its rings and outer orbs, the nycaloth bursts out of the moon, shattering it. The nycaloth then tries to kill all other creatures in the room, pursuing fleeing enemies. It ignores creatures inside the globe but attacks any creature that exits it.</p>
<p>When this nycaloth rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll made with its greataxe, it cuts off the target&rsquo;s head (or one of the target&rsquo;s heads, if it has more than one). If the target can&rsquo;t survive without the lost head, it dies. A target that is immune to slashing damage is immune to this effect.

Lair of the Sewn Sisters</h3><blockquote>
<p>Green smoke billows out from a bronze cauldron in the middle of this twenty-foot-high vaulted hall. Barely visible through the haze are three rocking chairs, several work benches heaped with haberdashery, a spinning wheel, and a rusty iron cage containing a prisoner. Galleries stand ten feet above the floor to either side of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The green smoke makes this chamber lightly obscured and blocks the characters' view of a great green door to the south (see &ldquo;Skeleton Gate&rdquo; below). The iron cage and its prisoner are described in the &ldquo;Cage&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>When the characters are in a position to get a better view of the upper galleries, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five wooden doors are set into the walls of the galleries, each carved with a geometric symbol: a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a hexagon, and an octagon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chamber belongs to the Sewn Sisters, a coven of three night hag loyal to Acererak. Together, the hags mother the atropal and guard the Soulmonger. They eagerly await the atropal&rsquo;s apotheosis, when the downfall of civilization promises an abundance of souls to harvest. The Sewn Sisters spy on intruders from the Border Ethereal. Any character who can perceive creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane sees the hags as spectral figures huddled in the middle of the room. See &ldquo;The Sewn Sisters&rdquo; sidebar for more information.</p>

When the adventurers arrive, these dolls scurry into view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three tiny figures waddle toward you through the smoky haze: a straw doll with rusty pins sticking into its body, a faceless child molded from clay, and a stuffed monkey with the lower body of a unicycle. The straw doll says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to run away! The Sewn Sisters will be back any moment now!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each doll is a Tiny construct with AC 10, 1 hit point, a walking speed of 10 feet, immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and no attacks. Destroying a doll causes the child&rsquo;s soul within it to become trapped in the Soulmonger.</p>
<p>The straw doll, Strawbundle, usually speaks for the group. Clay No-Face can speak only if it molds a mouth onto its blank face, and Joho the monkey coughs on its stuffing when it tries to talk. Given a chance, the dolls share the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sewn Sisters are three night hags. The dolls refuse to mention the hags by name, lest the hags hear their names being uttered.</li>
<li>The dolls were made from the souls of children and want to be free of the captors.</li>
<li>The hags are nursing some kind of creature that lurks on the other side of the skeleton gate (the great green door), but the dolls don&rsquo;t know what the creature is.</li>
<li>To learn more about the adventurers, the hags have been torturing the &ldquo;lookie-like&rdquo; in the cage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters take an interest in the skeleton gate, the dolls reveal what they know about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Five skeleton keys are needed to unlock the skeleton gate. Each key looks like an animated skeleton with a skull that extends into a carved key-like shape.</li>
<li>The skeleton keys wander the upper levels of the tomb.</li>
<li>Before the skeleton keys can be used, the skeleton gate&rsquo;s five keyholes must first be opened. The five adjoining rooms (areas 72 to 76) contain trials that can be overcome to open the five keyholes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dolls don&rsquo;t know the nature of the trials in areas 72 through 76, and they can&rsquo;t leave this chamber unless they are picked up and carried out.</p>
<p>If any character makes an effort to befriend one of the dolls, the soul of the child trapped inside the doll bestows a magical charm on that character. Each doll can bestow its charm once. These charms are similar to the ones described in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em> and follow the same rules.</p>

<p>A heavy padlock secures the gate of the rusted cage, inside which a naked figure cowers under a bloodstained blanket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mister Threadneedle (see <strong>area 74</strong>) carries the key to the padlock, which can otherwise be unlocked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools. The lock can also be broken off easily enough.</p>
<p>The cage&rsquo;s prisoner is a degenerate clone of one of the player characters and is instantly recognizable as such. It was created from blood or strands of hair obtained by one of the hags while the character slept. Characters had a slight chance of meeting the hag as a random wilderness encounter; however, when and where the theft occurred is up to you.</p>
<p>The clone is not a perfect copy. It is shorter and scrawnier than the character after whom it&rsquo;s modeled, and it has deformities. Use the commoner statistics to represent this creature, applying racial traits as appropriate.</p>
<p>The clone has no name and no memory of having been created. However, the hags have forged a magical link between the clone and the character from which it was made. The clone knows everything the character knows, up to and including all present knowledge. The hags have been interrogating the clone to learn everything about the adventurers.

<blockquote>
<p>This twelve-foot-high, ten-foot-wide door is made of green stone, its surface carved with grinning goblin skeletons. A belt of smooth stone spans the door at a height of four feet, set with five gold symbols in a row: a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a hexagon, and an octagon. Each symbol is engraved on a recessed circular seal.</p>

<p>The geometric symbols are 6 inches across, 1 foot apart, and set into stone disks 8 inches in diameter. Hidden behind the seals are five keyholes that conform in size and shape to the heads of the skeleton keys found on the other tomb levels (see <em>&ldquo;Skeleton Keys&rdquo;</em>).</p>
<p>Each time the characters complete a trial in areas 72 through 76, one stone seal rolls aside, exposing the keyhole behind it. When a skeleton key is inserted into its corresponding keyhole and turned clockwise, a tumbler inside the door unlocks. When all five tumblers unlock, the skeleton gate can be pulled open like a normal (albeit heavy) door, revealing a wide staircase that descends 20 feet to <strong>area 77</strong>. The door and its seals are impervious to damage and spells, and cannot be opened in a manner other than that which is prescribed above.</p>

The hags' goal is to seize one or more of the skeleton keys, thus preventing the characters from reaching the Soulmonger. If a hag obtains a skeleton key, it cackles as it returns to the Border Ethereal with it.</p>
<p>If two hags die, the third tries to bargain with the characters, offering useful information in exchange for her life. The hag makes the characters swear on their mortal souls not to harm her once her information is divulged. Any character who reneges on the agreement contracts slimy doom, as though he or she had failed a saving throw against the <wc-fetch type=spell>contagion</wc-fetch> spell. The hag reveals the following information (and nothing more) once an agreement is reached:</p>

Trial of the Triangle</h3><p>The door to this area has a triangle carved into it. When the characters open the door, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A five-foot-wide, floor-to-ceiling glass cylinder near the back wall of this room is filled with light, the source of which is not apparent. A tiny triangular hole is cut through the glass, five feet above the floor. Inside the cylinder, an iron lever is set into a metal plate on the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To reach the lever, the characters must figure out a way to enter or bypass the cylinder. If the lever is pulled, the triangle seal on the skeleton gate in <strong>area 71</strong> rolls aside, revealing a triangular keyhole behind it.</p>
<p>The cylinder is 5 feet in diameter, shaped of glass 2 inches thick. The triangular hole in the glass is 1 inch wide. The cylinder is normally impervious to damage and spells, and it can&rsquo;t be moved. A character in gaseous form can enter the cylinder through the hole, while an ethereal character can pass through the glass. A character can also use <wc-fetch type=spell>misty step</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>dimension door</wc-fetch>, or similar magic to enter the cylinder. A magically summoned creature can appear inside the cylinder, as can an <wc-fetch type=spell>unseen servant</wc-fetch>, either of which can be commanded to pull the lever. The lever is too heavy to be moved with a <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch> spell but responds to a <wc-fetch type=spell>telekinesis</wc-fetch> spell.</p>
<p>If three creatures stand around the glass cylinder, forming the points of a triangle around it, the cylinder turns brittle and can be shattered with any solid hit. Once the cylinder is destroyed, anyone can walk up to the lever and pull it.</p>

<p>This room is filled with flying sheets of parchment, with writing on the pages visible as they flutter by. A metal plate bolted onto the far wall is set with a ghostly lever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flying pages are from a spellbook and are destroyed if they take any amount of fire damage. A character can use an action to grab a page as it flutters past with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Written on the page is a random spell; roll a d6 to determine the spell&rsquo;s level, then randomly choose a spell of that level from the wizard spell list.</p>
<p>If more than three pages are taken, all the remaining pages in the room turn to dust, which coalesces into a hostile dust mephit and three illusory duplicates created by a <wc-fetch type=spell>mirror image</wc-fetch> spell. The mephit attacks all other creatures in the room, with its duplicates appearing to follow suit.</p>
<p>The mephit knows three command words: &ldquo;bloatbug,&rdquo; &ldquo;frogspittle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;spindledash.&rdquo; While in this room, it can speak one command word as a bonus action on it turn, triggering the associated magical effect below.

<p>The door to this area has a pentagon carved into it. When the characters open the door, read: The delicious aroma of spiced meat greets you. At the end of a twenty-foot-long corridor, a room opens up with red tapestries covering the walls. A feast is spread out on three tables, consisting of roast boar, squash stew, and a tray of iced cakes. Flagons of frothy beer complete the banquet.</p>
<p>A gaunt human male in a dusty black suit quietly arranges the items on the cake table, taking notice of your intrusion. Without a word, he gestures for you to come forward and sample the feast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gaunt gentleman is Mister Threadneedle, the Sewn Sisters' manservant. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of illusion magic around him. A successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 16) reveals his true form.</p>
<p>Mister Threadneedle is a scarecrow disguised with magic to appear human. In a pocket, he carries the Sewn Sisters' <em>hag eye</em> (see the &ldquo;Hags&rdquo; entry in the Monster Manual) and one lustrous black marble (see <strong>area 81</strong>). Mister Threadneedle understands Common but can&rsquo;t speak. He communicates by nodding and shaking his head, or with gestures and facial expressions.</p>
<p>Warned of the adventurers' arrival, the hags prepared this magical feast and instructed Mister Threadneedle to lay it out. The scarecrow attacks the characters only if they attack first, or if the hags command him to.</p>

Trial of the Hexagon</h3><p>Carved into the door of this room is a hexagon. When the characters open the door, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large, cracked, six-sided mirror is mounted above a stone shelf protruding from the opposite wall. Five unlit candles stand on the shelf, each made of yellow wax and covered with tiny black sigils. Scrawled on the wall above the mirror in dried blood are the words &ldquo;PIGGY PIGGY PIGGY.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sixth candle, identical to the five in plain view, is tucked out of sight under the stone shelf. Any character who searches the shelf for traps or hidden compartments automatically finds the sixth candle. Both the mirror and the candles radiate auras of conjuration magic to a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect.</p>

<p>If all six candles are lit, a character who looks in the mirror and says the word &ldquo;piggy&rdquo; three times in a row sees the reflected candlelight reveal a wooden lever set into a metal panel on the north wall. If fewer than six candles are lit when the words are spoken, the lever appears on the south wall instead. These levers exist only in the mirror&rsquo;s reflection, not in reality.</p>
<p>Only a character who can see a lever reflected in the mirror can pull it.

Trial of the Octagon</h3><p>Carved into the door of this room is an octagon. When the characters open the door, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ceiling of this plaster-walled room is fifteen feet high. A leather-backed tome rests open atop a wooden lectern bolted to the floor. Set into the wall behind the lectern are eight human skeletons, arranged so that they appear to be falling and screaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The skeletons are inanimate remains embedded into the plastered walls. The lectern is held in place by four bolts set deep into the floor and is impervious to damage, spells, and attempts to move it. The book&rsquo;s covers are secured to the lectern with <wc-fetch type=item>sovereign glue</wc-fetch>, preventing it from being easily removed. The eight-page book contains an eight-line nursery rhyme written by the Sewn Sisters in Infernal, with each page bearing one line of the poem. The book is open to pages 4 and 5 when the characters first arrive.</p>
<p>Hidden in the leg of the lectern, on the side facing the east wall, is a secret compartment that can be found with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the lines of the nursery rhyme (see below) are read aloud in reverse order, starting with the last line and ending on the first, the doors of the secret compartment open, revealing a brass lever inside. If the lever is pulled, the octagon seal on the skeleton gate in <strong>area 71</strong> rolls aside, revealing an octagonal keyhole behind it.</p>
<p>The compartment can also be opened with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell, or with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools. Opening the compartment in either manner triggers the trap (see &ldquo;Spider Fan Trap&rdquo; below).</p>

The seams are meant to deceive adventurers and make them wary of the floor, which doesn&rsquo;t actually have a pit underneath it.</p>
<p>The real danger is the ceiling, which appears to be smooth-cut stone but is actually thin plaster. Five feet above the false plaster ceiling is the room&rsquo;s true ceiling, which has a bladed fan shaped like a giant iron spider mounted to it.</p>
<p>If a character in the room reads the entire nursery rhyme beginning with the first line on page 1 and ending with the last line on page 8, or if the compartment in the lectern is opened improperly, the ceiling fan begins to twirl as a <wc-fetch type=spell>reverse gravity</wc-fetch> spell activates within the room. The lectern is the only fixed object in the room. Any creature within reach of it can, with a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, grab the lectern and avoid falling upward. A creature that can&rsquo;t grab the lectern or isn&rsquo;t secured in some other way &ldquo;falls&rdquo; upward through the fake plaster ceiling into the rotating blades of the fan, taking 44 (8d10) slashing damage. The creature takes that damage again each time it starts its turn on the ceiling. The <wc-fetch type=spell>reverse gravity</wc-fetch> effect lasts for 1 minute, after which creatures on the ceiling fall back down to the floor 20 feet below. Once the spell ends, the ceiling fan stops twirling. The trap does not reset.</p>

When the characters reach the bottom of the stairs, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crumbling balconies overlook a pool of lava filling this triangular chamber, above which is suspended an enormous crystal cylinder held in place by three adamantine struts. Wraithlike forms swirl inside the cylinder, and otherworldly screams hang in the air. Four long, writhing tentacles sprout from the cylinder&rsquo;s cap. A shriveled monstrosity the size of an elephant floats near the cylinder. Its body is wet and malformed, its arms and legs are atrophied, and its oversized head drips black goo. The creature is attached to the cylinder by a twisted umbilical cord.</p>

<p>The cylindrical device is the Soulmonger. The malformed creature floating next to it is an atropal, which feeds on the captured souls of the dead. The atropal attacks any creature that threatens it or tries to damage its food source. If the atropal dies, Acererak arrives to take his revenge (see &ldquo;Acererak&rsquo;s Revenge&rdquo; below).</p>

The adamantine struts that suspend it above the lava attach to an adamantine ring around the cylinder&rsquo;s midsection.</p>
<p>Under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect, the Soulmonger radiates an intense aura of necromantic magic. Destroying the Soulmonger not only ends the effects of the death curse (see the introduction to the adventure) but also frees all the souls trapped within the device. Freed souls travel to the afterlife, and any creature whose soul is set free can be brought back from the dead by magical means.</p>
<p>The Soulmonger is an artifact of evilâ€”a Huge object with AC 15; 200 hit points; vulnerability to radiant damage; and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.</p>

Each strut is a Large object with AC 20; 100 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. When a strut drops to 0 hit points, it breaks and causes the other two struts to snap as the Soulmonger falls.</p>
<p>The struts are wide enough that Medium or Small creatures can walk along them without difficulty. However, any creature that takes damage while standing on a strut must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off it, plunging into the lava unless the creature is somehow secured.</p>

Instead of dealing damage, a tentacle can grapple its target (escape DC 16). If the target weighs 330 pounds or less, the tentacle can also lift the grappled creature and move it to any unoccupied space within its 30-foot reach, or drop it in the lava.</p>

<p>You step out of the mist into an underground chapel with black basalt pillars and a polished obsidian altar. Resting on the altar is a leather bag the size and shape of a human body, and which appears to have been sewn shut. Beyond the altar, a heavy black drape hangs from an archway.</p>
<p>Eight emaciated, green-skinned creatures are shackled to the walls of the chapel, each one gazing toward you with a single baleful eye. The monsters begin to gibber and drool as they shake their manacles, eager to be set free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the atropal has fed on enough souls, Acererak plans to baptize it in the blood of a worthy sacrifice. This chapel was built for that dark ceremony. The Sewn Sisters obtained an appropriate sacrifice and have stitched it inside the leather body bag that rests on the altar.</p>

<p>If no suitable NPC springs to mind, use a captured member of the Order of the Gauntlet named Zalder Faelrond (LG male Tethyrian human knight of Torm, with no armor or weapons). Zalder&rsquo;s story is that he was kidnapped by the Sewn Sisters while patrolling the jungle. If set free, he requests an escort back to Camp Vengeance (see chapter 2).</p>

The nothics are restrained by the shackles and can&rsquo;t make melee attacks until they are set free. They speak Undercommon and demand to be released.</p>
<p>The night hag Widow Groat (see <strong>area 71</strong>) carries the keys to the nothics' shackles, which can also be picked with a successful DC 13 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools, or sundered with a good, hard weapon strike.</p>
<p>If the characters ignore the nothics' demands, the spiteful creatures attack them using their horrid Rotting Gaze.

<ul>
<li>If the characters are searching for an exit to the tomb, one nothic hops over to the black curtain, pulls it aside, points down the tunnel to the north (<strong>area 79</strong>), and shouts (in Undercommon), &ldquo;Mind the bones!&rdquo;</li>

Red Library</h3><p>The characters might arrive here by way of the tunnel to the east, or through the alcove in the southwest corner if they activate the purple-trail archway in <strong>area 79</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soft dulcimer music fills this room, the walls of which are painted the color of dried blood. Bookcases draped in cobwebs and dust line the walls and stand four deep in the middle of the room. Hundreds of leather-bound tomes weigh down their sagging shelves. At one end of the room, a small study contains a padded leather chair, a footstool, and a small table-as well as three corpses dangling upside down from shackles and chains bolted to the ceiling near the north wall. A lantern-shaped device resting atop the table appears to be the source of the music. An old man lies asleep in the chair, his hornrimmed spectacles slipping down to the end of his nose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The library contains the collected wisdom of a hundred sages, along with a few spellbooks and scrolls (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The corpses hanging along the north wall are the remains of three archmagi who tried to meddle in Acererak&rsquo;s affairs. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check confirms that all three died within the past month and that destructive spells were the cause of their demise.</p>
<p>The old man sleeping in the chair is an arcanaloth under the effect of its alter self spell. The fiend has one of the library&rsquo;s spellbooks lying open on its lap and pretends to be asleep. If approached, the man appears to wake and asks, &ldquo;Why do you disturb me?&rdquo; The creature won&rsquo;t reveal its true name, instead referring to itself as &ldquo;Mr. Fox.&rdquo; The arcanaloth is bound to the library by Acererak&rsquo;s magic and can&rsquo;t leave, nor can it allow any of the library&rsquo;s books or scrolls to be removed.</p>
<p>If any character speaks the arcanaloth&rsquo;s true name (&ldquo;Ygga Raxyg&rdquo;; see <strong>area 71</strong>) within earshot of the fiend, it is stunned for 1 minute. Once the stunned effect wears off, repeating the arcanaloth&rsquo;s name has no effect on it for the next 24 hours. If killed, the arcanaloth melts into a pool of ichor, leaving behind its robes and hornrimmed spectacles (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>

The spectacles are also a gate key that opens a portal in the planar city of Sigil. The portal is a two-way door to the plane of Arcadia. A <wc-fetch type=spell>legend lore</wc-fetch> spell cast on the spectacles reveals this information and raises their potential value to 2,500 gp if they are sold to a wizard or sage.</p>
<p>The object on the table is a music box made of dark wood with gold filigree. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect reveals an aura of conjuration magic around it. Each of its five sides is sculpted with the image of a horned woman playing a different musical instrument: a dulcimer, a flute, a harp, a lyre, and a viol. While touching the box, a creature can use an action to make it play music featuring one of the instruments shown, which can be heard up to 60 feet away. The character can also use an action to stop the music. The music box is worth 750 gp.</p>
<p>The library contains two hundred historical texts (50 gp each), sixty tomes of arcane lore (100 gp each), three dusty <wc-fetch type=item>Spell Scroll (7th level)</wc-fetch> (<wc-fetch type=spell>create undead</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=spell>fabricate</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=spell>resurrection</wc-fetch>), and six <wc-fetch type=item>spellbook</wc-fetch>. The first three spellbooks contain 1d6 spells each of 1st through 3rd level. The fourth and fifth spellbooks contain 1d4 spells each of 4th through 6th level. The sixth spellbook has a title (<em>X the Mystic&rsquo;s Arcane Grimoire</em>) burned into its spine and contains 1d3 spells each of 7th through 9th level.</p>

<p>The pool radiates an aura of conjuration magic to a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar effect. Creatures that come into contact with the ooze are unharmed. Any object that isn&rsquo;t being worn or carried by a creature disappears if submerged in the black ooze. Such items are permanently lost, having been transported to a secret demiplane whose location cannot be divined. Any amount of ooze that is removed from the pool disappears instantly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The black marble sinks into the ooze, which rises up suddenly to form a four-foot-tall black obeliskâ€”a miniature version of the obelisk that stood outside the tomb entrance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any creature that touches the ooze obelisk is teleported, along with all objects it is wearing and carrying, to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the obelisk outside the tomb entrance (<strong>area 1</strong>). This effect is not subject to the magical wards that prevent teleportation spells from functioning within the tomb.</p>
<p>The ooze obelisk sinks back into the pool and disappears after 1 minute. Tossing another black marble into the pool causes the obelisk to reform.</p>

Characters who accomplish this goal will have saved many lives, and if word spreads of their heroism, wealthy and influential NPCs come forward bearing gifts of thanks. These gifts can take many forms, including parcels of land and special favors (see &ldquo;Marks of Prestige&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>). If the characters allow the atropal to survive in the depths of the tomb, it eventually attracts nihilistic devotees of Acererak who feed it their own dark souls as nourishment.</p>

Three of Port Nyanzaru&rsquo;s merchant princes express interest in buying the chalice: Ifan Talro&rsquo;a wants to add it to his private collection of Chultan relics, KwayothÃ© wants to melt it down, and Zhanthi wants it for sentimental reasons. Denying any one of them would be a grave mistake on the characters' part and might result in them receiving an ominous Ytepka Society token.</p>

If the characters destroy the Soulmonger and Syndra is still alive, priests quickly restore her to full health, and the characters can collect their promised reward. If Syndra dies but her soul is saved before the atropal devours it, she is raised from the dead within a tenday of the Soulmonger&rsquo;s destruction and honors her agreement with the party.

She has assembled all the information she has on Chult and given us a map with all of the details that she has discovered on it.</p>

He is justifiably concerned that the ring would dominate and control any other owner. Furthermore, Artus would begin to age as a normal human without the ring, and he wants to live forever with his beloved Alisanda.</p>
<p>Xandala, the Harpers, the Zhentarim, and frost giants loyal to Jarl Storvald won&rsquo;t stop searching for the <wc-fetch type=item>Ring of Winter</wc-fetch>. If the characters make their way back to civilization with Artus in tow, they should encounter one or more of these groups along the way. Valindra Shadowmantle and the Red Wizards of Thay also won&rsquo;t pass up a chance to take the ring by force.</p>
<p>With or without the ring, Artus Cimber continues to await Mezro&rsquo;s return while searching for the means to reach or summon the displaced city. Nothing matters to him more than reuniting with his wife. Characters interested in helping Artus can use divination spells or downtime to conduct research. They might also consult with the Harpers, who have access to lore that might assist Artus in his quest, but they demand the ring in exchange for their assistance. Forced to choose between the Harpers' assistance and the ring, Artus chooses the latter. Alternatively, a portal to Mezro&rsquo;s demiplane might be hidden somewhere in Chult, creating the seeds of a wonderful new adventure.</p>

As long as Artus Cimber is alive, Dragonbait remains committed to helping his friend find the displaced city of Mezro. If Artus is dead and there&rsquo;s no hope of raising him, Dragonbait opts to return to Port Nyanzaru, where he drowns his sorrows in a few casks of tej before enjoying some downtime. The saurial gives off the scent of roses as he waves farewell to the party. He eventually crosses paths with Volothamp Geddarm, and the two explorers embark on numerous adventures together.</p>

If Ras Nsi is still alive, he has no further use for the characters once the death curse is ended. Believing they know too much for their own good, he sends a party of yuan-ti to capture or kill them before they leave the city. If the party obtained the Black Opal Crown, they can trade the item for their lives.</p>
<p>If Fenthaza lives, Ras Nsi makes the mistake of putting her in charge of the team sent to kill the characters, and she offers the party a deal instead. If the characters agree to kill Ras Nsi, they can go free and keep whatever treasure they take from the fane except for the Black Opal Crown, which Fenthaza insists be given to her at once. If the characters defeat Ras Nsi handily, Fenthaza honors her end of the deal. If they emerge from the fane weakened, she tries to destroy them.</p>
<p>Princess MwaxanarÃ© wants to restore Omu to its former glory and build a new kingdom there. With the Skull Chalice of Ch&rsquo;gakare in her possession, she can win the support of Chultans eager to return to the old ways. However, the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru aren&rsquo;t willing to back her claim, and the yuan-ti won&rsquo;t give up Omu without a fight. It could take years for MwaxanarÃ©&rsquo;s dream to come true, if it ever does.</p>

Using her teleportation circle, she returns to Thay and informs Szass Tam that her mission in Chult has failed. Angered by the party&rsquo;s interference, Szass Tam sends new operatives and powerful undead to spy on the characters, learn their weaknesses, and (eventually) dispose of them. If the characters have friendly ties to the Harpers or the Zhentarim, spies working for one faction or the other learn of the Red Wizard plot and can warn the characters.</p>
