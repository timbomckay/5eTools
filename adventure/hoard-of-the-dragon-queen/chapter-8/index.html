<p>The cult has acquired a friendly roost in Skyreach Castle, a flying fortress built by cloud giants. This castle is docked near the village of Parnast and guarded by mists, magic, and monsters. The fortress contains much of the treasure and valuables that the cult has looted from the surrounding regionâ€”treasure that will be added to an even more monstrous hoard at the Well of Dragons, where the cult plans to summon forth Tiamat.</p>
<p>By the time the characters arrive in the village, Rezmir has already announced that the fortress must be made ready for departure. Characters should have time to deal with Talis and possibly other cultists before it takes to the sky.</p>
<p>The characters must be smart in how they tackle storming the castleâ€”it&rsquo;s clearly a well-fortified place. They also can&rsquo;t wait too long. If the characters tarry, Skyreach Castle leaves to pick up more treasure from another lair of the cult. The exact moment when it takes flight is up to you as DM.</p>
<p>If Talis is with the party, she can use her rank and influence to get the characters safely to Skyreach Castle, but once inside, she cannot guarantee their safety and, in fact, turns against them at the earliest opportunity. Characters should be at or near level 8 by the end of this chapter.</p>

Village of Parnast</h3><p>This small village is secretly under the control of the Cult of the Dragon. The cultists load and unload goods here, and some of those goods are sent to Talis&rsquo;s hunting lodge (see <strong>area chapter 7</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The village has a few dozen houses and a small square, with buildings that include a tavern, a stable, and a shrine. In contrast to this rustic burg stands a mighty ice castle half hidden in a fog-shrouded ravine: walls stand forty feet high, huge narrow towers loom upwardâ€”one of blue ice, one crumblingâ€”and all of it is built to a scale for giants. Wisps of fog hide much of the castle&rsquo;s detail, but you see two statues standing just before the enormous gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cultists posing as villagers are unfriendly toward visitors, while villagers under the cult&rsquo;s sway remain silent and withdraw from visitors for fear of incurring the cult&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>If the characters demand to speak with someone in charge, they are directed to Captain Othelstan (appendix D) but are also warned that he has no time or patience for dealing with outlaws.</p>

One man, Gundalin the Wheelwright, a human male who makes wheels and fixes axles for the merchants, woodsfolk, and others, wants the cult gone. If the characters look around for someone who is not a member of the cult, they might find him at the Golden Tankard (where he says nothing) or at his small shop on the square. He often tries to catch their eye, but he is terrified of the cult and speaks only in a safe haven where he can&rsquo;t be seen. He knows all of the information in the &ldquo;Rumors and Information&rdquo; section.</p>

The following bits of information are available, one for each success, and should be doled out in the order presented below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The highest-ranking member of the cult to frequent Parnast is the half-dragon, Wyrmspeaker Rezmir. (If she is still alive and free, Rezmir has gone into hiding. No one in the village knows where she is, although they claim that Skyreach Castle is the most likely place to find her.)</li>
<li>Rezmir&rsquo;s deputy is a cult veteran and dragonsoul name Captain Othelstan. He commands the cult forces in Parnast, and he monitors all visitors and merchandise passing through the village.</li>
<li>The cult has controlled Parnast for more than a year, and it basically brought in a company of thugs to take over.</li>
<li>Some villagers were already cult infiltrators, and others signed up when it became clear that the cultists are rich and have a private army.</li>
<li>The cultists keep trained wyverns in the village stables. The cultists use them to reach the castle while it is airborne. (No one in the village, including Captain Othelstan, knows where the castle goes after it leaves Parnast.)</li>
<li>Characters can also learn one of two pass-phrases for safely entering for the castle from Gundalin or anyone who becomes a friendly helper to them: &ldquo;Tiamat, Our Mother and Strength&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hail Blagothkus.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=2-the-golden-tankard>
<a href=#2-the-golden-tankard class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>2. The Golden Tankard</h3><blockquote>
<p>A yellow tankard hangs over the door of this rustic tavern. Inside, though, the place is short on cheer. All conversation stops and all eyes turn in your direction. A tall, heavyset man with enormous muttonchop sideburns steps forward and asks, &ldquo;What can I get you travelers?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A visitor can buy a mug of beer for 3 cp or a mug of strong mead for 1 sp. There&rsquo;s sausage on the menu as well as stewed cabbage and heavy black bread (4 cp for a plate full), but no one visits for the fine dining. It&rsquo;s just enough to keep a visitor going another day, and no more than that.</p>
<p>If the characters sit and order ale, well and good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will send the pot boy out to you in a moment with the finest available in my humble tavern.&rdquo; He goes toward the kitchen, bellowing for a cask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The owner is Raggnar Redtooth, who seems friendly enough but secretly takes bribes from the Cult of the Dragon. Strangers are never really welcome in his tavern, but they get service while he informs Captain Othelstan by sending a messenger. Raggnar has a violent past and is treated as an unarmored veteran (AC 10). He keeps his weapons behind the bar.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/HotDQ/048-tod-08-02.png alt="Captain Othelstan" class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>Prying information from Raggnar and his clientele is difficult. The villagers want to keep the characters occupied, and they ask for them to tell tales of their journey, they inquire about the characters' families and where they are from, and they query how the party got here.</p>
<p>If asked about a place to sleep, Raggnar makes it clear that he isn&rsquo;t an innkeeper: there are no beds or rooms, and even the stable is full. If anyone asks why, he gives his usual excuse: &ldquo;Lord Marsten and his entourage are coming to hunt. All the servants are making things ready for their arrival.&rdquo; (This is pure nonsense, of courseâ€”he has no rooms other than his own.) If the characters just wait a moment, Raggnar says he will offer them his own chambers, for a steep fee of 10 gp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll clear out a few things and it is all yours.&rdquo; This is also a stalling tactic, though he&rsquo;ll certainly take the money.</p>
<p>Because the cultists are about to ship a castle full of treasure from the village, they desperately don&rsquo;t want the characters to find anything suspicious, such as wagons loaded with chests (there&rsquo;s no room to hide a caravan in a village this small) or their wyvern mounts in the stables (see area 3). If Raggnar can keep the characters eating and drinking and gossiping, then Skyreach Castle can slip away into the sky.</p>

This is a <wc-fetch type=item>tankard of plenty</wc-fetch>). The command word is &ldquo;Illefarn&rdquo;.</p>

The Stable</h3><blockquote>
<p>The two big doors leading into the stable are sealed, and the place looks shuttered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters ask around, the villagers claim that the stable was put out of business some time ago. Anyone listening carefully hears a bellowing noise, though (no check required). The cult keeps two Wyvern in the stable; sometimes, they unleash a wyvern-sized roar.</p>
<p>Cracked sheep bones and a few ox skulls cover the stable floor. Other than riding harnesses for the wyverns, there is no treasure here.</p>
<blockquote>

The difficult part is getting their harnesses attached so that riders don&rsquo;t fall off, and giving the proper commands once airborne.</p>
<p>Any character can put the harness on a wyvern with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the wyvern strenuously objects and attacks the character once with its tail stinger as a reaction. The wyverns aren&rsquo;t choosy about who rides them, but convincing a wyvern to fly or move in a specific direction requires an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check; if the check fails, the wyvern ignores the rider&rsquo;s commands until the rider&rsquo;s next turn. After a rider succeeds on two such checks, the wyvern goes where the rider wants for the next hour, or until it takes damage or the rider dismounts.</p>
<p>The castle is easily spotted, day or night, out to a range of five miles. The wyverns are faster than the castle in flight, and they can catch up to it.</p>

<p>A statue of Angharradh, an obscure elven deity representing spring, stands among statues of gods representing the other seasons, namely Auril (winter), Chauntea (summer), and Mielikki (autumn).

<p>Timber merchants, woodsfolk, and others haggle over the finer lumber here, and wagons carry supplies. See <strong>area areas 2</strong>, <strong>area 3</strong>, and 4 for more information about the tavern, the stable, and the shrine.</p>
<p>The well is 40 feet deep, cold, and pure. Five human Guard loyal to the Cult of the Dragon keep an eye out here at all times, making sure that villagers do as they are told. If the guards are confronted, one runs to fetch Captain Othelstan as the villagers flee. Only the wheelwright Gundalin sticks around to watch, and even he does so from behind a heavy wooden oxcart.</p>

The question of timing is tricky, since the party might head straight to the castle and miss a lot of possible information and roleplaying in Parnast. So, Skyreach Castle should leave whenever it seems most dramatic to you as DM, but here are some tips to help you choose the best moment.</p>
<p><strong>Storming the Castle Immediately:</strong> Aggressive players can assail the castle while it&rsquo;s on the ground. In addition to dealing with the castle&rsquo;s defenses, they must also contend with reinforcements from Parnast. Such reinforcements include Captain Othelstan, one veteran, six Guard, and three Dragonclaw. In addition, Othelstan and the veteran (his lieutenant) ride a pair of Wyvern (see <strong>area area 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Dawdling and Resting:</strong> Any party that spends an hour or more in the village asking questions, getting a meal or rest, or otherwise not getting aboard the castle might miss the boat. The castle leaves one hour after the cultists realize the village has been infiltrated. After the castle is gone, the villagers drop all pretense of friendliness and send Captain Othelstan (see appendix D), one veteran, and six Guard to attempt to capture the intruders and either kill them as sacrifices or drive them out of the village. Othelstan can also call for reinforcements in the form of three Dragonclaw, one of whom takes the time to release the two Wyvern in the stables (see <strong>area area 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Last Recourse:</strong> If the castle flies away without the characters, Gundalin or another villager predisposed to help the party might provide assistance before Captain Othelstan and his retinue arrive, suggesting that the characters rush to the stables, mount the wyverns, and take flight at once. The characters have a few rounds to reach the stables before Othelstan has the building surrounded and demands their surrender.</p>

The spirit of a giant enables it to flyâ€”this ancient bond dates back to the days when giants and dragons fought great wars. The binding kept dragons from taking these castles for their own, and the bond still holds centuries later.</p>
<p>The cult has struck a bargain with the castle&rsquo;s owner, a cloud giant named Blagothkus who harbors no particular hatred of dragonkind (or anything else, for that matter). The spirit of his deceased wife, Esclarotta, controls the castle&rsquo;s propulsion and buoyancy. The cult cannot afford to alienate Blagothkus, because the castle&rsquo;s spirit will not obey them.</p>
<p>Skyreach Castle is carved from ice so thick as to be opaque. The ice is as strong and impenetrable as granite, thanks to ancient cloud giant wizardry. Towers and walls surround an iceberg core that&rsquo;s been hollowed out to serve as the lair of a powerful white dragon allied with the cult. The whole thing can be hidden under a veil of fog and cloud, or set to move slowly with the wind. See <strong>area area 19</strong> for details.</p>

While on the ground, the castle rests in a wide ravine on the outskirts of Parnast. Everything in the ravine is heavily obscured by fog, so the characters can approach the castle without being seen by its inhabitants. Until the castle takes flight, cultists and guards from the village deliver wagons laden with supplies and treasure to the castle&rsquo;s main gate (see <strong>area area 6</strong> for details).</p>

<p>These adversaries do not entirely trust one another and are unlikely to present a unified front against the characters. Instead, the giants fight to defend their home, and the cultists and dragon fight to defend their treasure. If the characters play their hand wisely, this lack of trust will be the villains' undoing. The NPCs have dozens of servants, cultists, and guards at their disposal. If more than one or two of these turn up dead, the cultists search the castle for the killers.</p>

<p>Blagothkus thinks giants have grown soft, and thrashing some dragons would be good for giantkind. So, he plays along with the cult, but on the side he is gathering support among giants, urging them to assume their rightful place as lords of the world. He believes that the rise of Tiamat and the threat of a dragon empire will spur the giants to unite.</p>
<p>Blagothkus has no conflict with &ldquo;small folk.&rdquo; He&rsquo;ll happily let the party know that yes, his castle is transporting a vast amount of treasure to the Well of Dragons, where the cult is gathering its forces and amassing a hoard in anticipation of the Tiamat&rsquo;s arrival (from where he doesn&rsquo;t know). If the characters want to help him fight cultists, he&rsquo;ll happily take them somewhere more interesting up north, where he&rsquo;s massing his own small army to fight the dragons after they have been lured out into the open. This army is further detailed in The Rise of Tiamat.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Prior to the castle taking flight and leaving Parnast, the cult moves a few wagons laden with treasure chests and supplies into the lower courtyard and unloads them every hour or two during daylight. Adventurers within earshot of the gate who listen closely can also hear the password spoken as each cart passes by.</p>
<p>The supply carts provide a way for the party to enter the castle undetected. Cultists haul the supplies to the kitchen (<strong>area area 15</strong>) and carry the treasure chests down to the dragon&rsquo;s main hoard chamber (<strong>area area 25</strong>).</p>

Lower Courtyard</h3><p>The upper courtyard (<strong>area area 16</strong>) partially overhangs the lower courtyard, held aloft by gigantic arches of ice. At night, the lower courtyard is heavily obscured by fog to a height of 40 feetâ€”the same height as the walls that enclose it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walls of solid ice enclose this courtyard. Another courtyard partially overhangs this one. It is held aloft by sweeping arches of ice that soar to a height of over 100 feet. Doors of sculpted ice fitted with iron hinges lead to various outbuildings and main keep on the far side of the courtyard from the gate towers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add the following if one or more characters succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hidden in the shadows of the overhanging courtyard, across from the main gate, is an opening in one wall that leads to a spiral staircase made of sculpted ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Combat here alerts the ogres in area 6, the cultists in <strong>area area 9</strong>, the stone giants in <strong>area area 10</strong>, and the kobolds in<strong>area area 15</strong>. One of the cultists runs to <strong>area area 11</strong> and alerts Rezmir, who arrives with her Guard Drake three rounds later.</p>

<p>At any given time, ten Dragonwing (see appendix D for statistics) are resting here. Half of them are sound asleep, while the other half are awake but doing nothing overly strenuous.

Stone Giants' Chamber</h3><p>Two 20-foot-tall, 8-foot-wide archways connect this chamber to the lower courtyard. Any loud disturbance in the courtyard alerts the stone giants that dwell here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the middle of this frost-glazed room stands a nine-foot-tall table of carved stone surrounded by three giant-sized chairs, also carved from stone. A fat iron cauldron etched with runes rests upon the table. On the floor in the far corner sits a large iron chest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If an alarm has not been raised and the stone giants are present, add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A male stone giant gazes into the cauldron while a female stone giant sits nearby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the castle alarms have not sounded, the characters gain a surprise round.</p>
<p>The two Stone Giant, Wiglof and Hulda, are guests of the cloud giant. They are worried that Blagothkus&rsquo;s attempts to incite the giants into action against the dragons could lead to devastating consequences, but they are supportive nonetheless. They have agreed to help Blagothkus repair damage to the castle and gladly aid in its defense.</p>
<p>Presently, Wiglof is using a magic cauldron (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;) to perform an augury ritual and hopes to ascertain the most likely outcome of Blagothkus&rsquo;s alliance with the Cult of the Dragon, to either confirm or assuage the cloud giant&rsquo;s fears that the cult is planning to betray him. Any attack launched against Wiglof disrupts his ritual and angers him greatly. Hulda is Wiglof&rsquo;s companion and bodyguard, and any hostility directed at her or Wiglof is met with brutal force.</p>
<p>The stone giants know that the flying castle is controlled from a steering tower (<strong>area area 19</strong>) accessible from the upper courtyard, and that only giants can gain entry to the tower.</p>

Their collection is secured by a magical globe of force inside an iron chest, which is six feet long, four feet tall and wide, and weighs 500 pounds. Lifting the heavy iron lid requires an action and a DC 12 Strength check, and destroying the globe of force requires an <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> or a successful casting of <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 16). The 32 gems are worth 500 gp each, or a total of 16,000 gp. The iron chest also contains the stone giants' masonry tools, but they are neither valuable nor usable by smaller creatures.</p>
<p>The iron cauldron weighs 50 pounds. When filled with water or some other liquid, the cauldron substitutes for the normal material components needed to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>augury</wc-fetch> spell. The cauldron is worth 25 gp.</p>

Rezmir&rsquo;s Chamber</h3><p>The door is always locked and Rezmir holds the key. A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell is the easiest way to get in, but a character can also unlock the door with a DC 25 Dexterity check made using <wc-fetch type=item>thieves' tools</wc-fetch>. Alternatively, knocking and spinning a good yarn might work; cultists and servants come and go at all hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large rug covers the icy floor just inside the door of this 10-foot-high room, which is lit by a brazier of hot coals. A large bed rests in one corner, a desk in another. Resting atop the desk is a handsome, iron-banded chest secured with a sturdy padlock.</p>

<p>Unless she is lured elsewhere by a general alarm, Rezmir (see appendix D) is here along with two loyal Guard Drake (appendix D).</p>
<p>The large rug inside of the door is actually a rug of smothering. The rug patiently waits for a creature to walk onto it before attacking. If they are present, Rezmir and her drakes wait for the rug to attack an enemy coming through the door before springing into action.</p>

In addition, the chest here is locked and magically attuned to Rezmir so that if she dies, its contents are teleported to the Well of Dragons and out of her slayers' hands.</p>
<p>The chest&rsquo;s padlock can be picked using <wc-fetch type=item>thieves' tools</wc-fetch> with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. However, the lock is rigged with a poison needle trap that triggers if the check fails by 5 or more. The needle can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check and can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A creature triggering the needle trap or failing the Dexterity check by 5 or more is injected with <wc-fetch type=item>Wyvern Poison</wc-fetch> and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (<wc-roll>7d6</wc-roll>) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The chest contains the <wc-fetch type=item>Black Dragon Mask</wc-fetch> (see appendix C) as well as Rezmir&rsquo;s private collection of gems, jewelry, and coins. The gems and jewelry includes a set of matched peridot stones on a gold chain (400 gp), a silver torc with dragon&rsquo;s heads (200 gp), six moonstones of 50 gp each, and a set of 20 loose pearls, worth a total of 3,000 gp.

</span></p>
<p>Rath Modar (see appendix D for statistics), a Red Wizard of Thay allied with the Cult of the Dragon, resides here. Unless he was killed or captured previously, Azbara Jos (see appendix D for statistics) is also present. If both Red Wizards are present, they are in the midst of a scholarly argument when the characters arrive, but they clam up as soon as others appear. If Rath Modar is alone, he is standing at a lectern, reading a book (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If Azbara is absent, Rath Modar might mistake the characters for cultists. If the characters play along and attempt to gather information from the Red Wizard, roleplay it out. Rath is no fool, and he is an expert at seeing through illusions and deceptions. He also has a healthy suspicion of strangers, especially if the characters are wounded or inappropriately equipped.</p>
<p>Rath Modar is here to help watch over the vast treasure being transported to the Well of Dragons and also to plan for the summoning of Tiamat; the necessary incantations are complex and require hundreds of skilled spellcasters. He knows that the cult&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to free Tiamat and raise her temple from the Nine Hells, and Rath&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to use Tiamat and her dragons to overthrow Szass Tam.</p>
<p>The horse skulls on the ceiling are ghastly ornaments and nothing more.</p>
<p>Three of the gargoyles are statues; the fourth is a living gargoyle that serves Rath Modar.</p>

<p>A thorough search of the room yields several letters to Rath Modar from Severin, the supreme leader of the Cult of the Dragon. Severin&rsquo;s letters reveal the depths of the connections between the Red Wizards (at least those friendly to Rath Modar) and the cult. The characters also find other letters from Thay revealing that clearly some Red Wizards are not nearly as keen on the cult&rsquo;s plans. If the characters deliver these letters to Leosin Erlanthar, Ontharr Frume, or one of their other contacts in organizations opposed to the Red Wizards and the Cult of the Dragon, award the party 1,000 XP.</p>
<p>Resting on a lectern is a book titled <em>Beyond the Iron Gates</em>. Written entirely in Infernal, it describes various forms of devil summoning, but the final chapter describes the use of massive summonings and the sacrifice of hundreds of souls to bring Tiamat bodily out of the Nine Hells and into the world. The details of the ritual make it clear that this is something that requires enormous preparation and expenseâ€”but the actual magical formulae and chants are not given in this volume. Neither the book nor the other papers here, however, provide a timetable for when the cult or the Red Wizards plan to attempt the summoning, nor do they mention the significance of the treasure that the cult has amassed. (Rath Modar and Azbara Jos can both attest that the treasure is to appease Tiamat upon her arrival.)</p>

<p>Twenty Kobold are here, preparing food for the castle&rsquo;s other inhabitants. The kitchen is filled with huge sides of beef, entire sheep, chests full of dried fish and vast amounts of bacon, onions, beans, and so forth.</p>
<p>Roosting on a ledge above the fray is a griffon. The creature is Blagothkus&rsquo;s pet, and it makes sure the kobolds behave themselves. Whenever a fight breaks out, one shriek from above snaps the kobolds back in line. The griffon also protects the kobolds if they come under attack.</p>

</span></p>
<p>This is the tower of the vampire Sandesyl Morgia, a moon elf who joined the Cult of the Dragon long before she became undead. She is a member of the old guard and was around long before Severin took over. Given the chance, she talks about serving under Sammaster and killing dragons to raise them as dracoliches, which she still considers &ldquo;the true path.&rdquo; She hates the new cult leadership, but she is forced by circumstance to work with them.</p>
<p>Sandesyl is active by night only and prowls both the upper and lower courtyards in the night hours, keeping a keen eye out for lone ogre guards or others who might provide a meal. When confronted by more enemies than she can handle, she summons two vampire spawn (moon elf consorts) as reinforcements. These vampire spawn lurk on the upper floor of the tower.</p>
<p>The tower is in dire need of repair. The cracked and crumbled ice provides abundant handholds, allowing the tower&rsquo;s walls to be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>The tower once had four levels with 20-foot-high ceilings; however, all but the highest level have had their floors and ceilings shattered, and the staircase that once curled up the inside of the tower, connecting its various levels, has also been destroyed. The ground floor is now packed with icy debris to a depth of 20 feet, and this debris prevents the ground-floor door from being opened.</p>

Steering Tower</h3><p>Blagothkus has secured the door to this tower with an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch>. It can be opened normally by a giant or by a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell. For everyone else, breaking it down is largely impossible, because a DC 70 Strength check is required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A staircase of ice leads from the tower&rsquo;s ground floor to a higher chamber, the walls and ceiling of which gleam and glitter: Jewels are everywhere in the room. You see glowing moonstones, thumb-sized emeralds, shining silvery mithral wands, and strange spheres covered in turquoise and gold, as well as dozens of copper levers and golden spheres embedded in the walls. After a moment, the walls themselves seem to disappear, providing a perfect aerial view in all directions, as if there were no castle and no cloudstuff around. More than a dozen glowing white runes wink into existence, drifting about the room like snowflakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the castle&rsquo;s steering chamber. When no one is present, the castle is under the control of the spirit of Esclarotta, who is bound to the fortress by powerful magic that cannot be dispelled. Touching one of the glowing runes issues a specific command to Esclarotta&rsquo;s spirit. A character who understands Dwarvish or Giant can interpret the command runes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alarm:</strong> A noise akin to a howling wind alerts all non-<wc-fetch type=condition>deafened</wc-fetch> creatures in the castle.</p>
<p><strong>All-Clear:</strong> A noise akin to a loud whisper signals an end to danger.</p>
<p><strong>Anchor:</strong> The castle holds position on the ground or in the air. The castle remains stationary despite winds, storms, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Calm:</strong> The thunderclouds around the castle abate over a period of 1 minute. During this time, the storm rune cannot be reactivated.</p>
<p><strong>Cast Off:</strong> The castle is no longer anchored.</p>
<p><strong>Drift:</strong> The castle drifts on the wind, effectively under no one&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p><strong>Home:</strong> The castle returns to its place of origin, in the Spine of the World (a cold mountain range to the north).</p>
<p><strong>North, South, East, and West:</strong> The castle moves in the specified cardinal direction. Touching two runes simultaneously can move the castle in other directions; for example, touching the north and east runes at the same time moves the castle northeast.</p>
<p><strong>Rise:</strong> The castle ascends at a rate of 10 feet per round.</p>
<p><strong>Sink:</strong> The castle descends at a rate of 10 feet per round. If it comes into contact with the ground, it lands.</p>
<p><strong>Spin:</strong> The castle rotates gently clockwise, completing one full rotation in 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Storm:</strong> The clouds around the castle darken and churn, becoming rumbling thunderclouds over a period of 1 minute. Until then, the calm rune cannot be activated. Once the thunderclouds have fully formed, the creature that activated the storm rune can use its action while standing in the steering chamber to target one creature it can see with a lightning bolt. The bolt has a range of 1,000 feet and can target one creature or unattended object. A creature targeted by the bolt must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) lightning damage. An unattended object targeted by the bolt simply takes the damage (no saving throw).</p>
<p><strong>Unveil:</strong> Foggy cloudstuff engulfing the castle dissipates. Lightly obscured areas become clear in 1 round, and heavily obscured areas become lightly obscured for 1 minute, then become clear.</p>
<p><strong>Veil:</strong> Foggy cloudstuff materializes around the castle. After one minute, all creatures and objects in outdoor areas within 100 feet of the castle are heavily obscured, and all creatures and objects in indoor areas are lightly obscured.</p>
<p><strong>Widdershins:</strong> The castle rotates gently counterclockwise, completing one full rotation in one minute.</p>

<p>Any character succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check senses an intelligence at work, and one can attempt to communicate with Esclarotta&rsquo;s spirit simply by calling out to it while inside the tower. She is a kind soul, disturbed by the cultists, dragon, wyverns, and kobolds infesting her beautiful castle, and she longs for information about what her husband is up to. Requests made to her succeed with a DC 14 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>). The person has advantage on the check if he or she speaks Giant. If anyone tries to wreck the steering chamber, Esclarotta triggers the alarm rune. Blagothkus (see appendix D) arrives 3 rounds later with two Ogre (his stewards) in tow.</p>
<p>If Blagothkus dies aboard the castle, his spirit replaces Esclarotta&rsquo;s, and he crashes the castle to keep it from falling into enemy hands (see &ldquo;Developments&rdquo;).</p>

<p>This destroys the castle&rsquo;s ability to move under power, generate weather effects, and so on. The castle will drift on powerful winds that carry it northward, where it ultimately crashes on the Miklos Glacier in the Spine of the World Mountains.

<p>If the dragon is slain and the cultists are routed, Rath Modar gathers any remaining forces allied with the cult and slays Blagothkus, knowing full well that the cloud giant&rsquo;s death will cause the castle to crash (see above).

Getting more than the basic rundown takes a DC 19 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check for each of the following three additional items:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vampire watches the Skyreach Castle at night. It sometimes feeds on the ogres, to their chagrin.</li>
<li>The cult uses the castle to visit important sites without roads or portals. The ogres don&rsquo;t really know where they are other than &ldquo;the green forests&rdquo; and &ldquo;that stretch of the moors&rdquo; and &ldquo;the old mountains.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The castle&rsquo;s mists and navigation are all controlled by the cloud giant&rsquo;s magic. Without him, the castle won&rsquo;t fly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Four Ogre guard the lower level. They wear fancy plumed helmets to signify that they are members of Blagothkus&rsquo;s &ldquo;honor guard.&rdquo; This simple reward keeps the ogres alert and loyal, for they know the giant could give their helms away to someone else at any time.</p>

<p>Blagothkus (appendix D) and the two Ogre (his stewards) aren&rsquo;t the only inhabitants of this room.

<p>The dim-witted ogre stewards are poor conversationalists, but Blagothkus uses them as sounding boards, expressing his concerns that the Cult of the Dragon might try to seize control of the castle. The ogres offer no advice. Clever characters can sow discord by preying on the giant&rsquo;s fears (see &ldquo;<strong>area Negotiating with the Cloud Giant</strong>&rdquo; near the beginning of the chapter). An alarm or the characters' sudden appearance startles him, and he reaches for his weapon. If the characters are pretending to be cultists, Blagothkus is furious at their intrusion but does not attack unless they further provoke him. The ogres defend their master to the death.</p>

Servant Barracks</h3><p>Twenty Kobold are trying to sleep here on dozens of small piles of bedding, fur, and clothes. They are exhausted and ignore the characters unless they are in great danger. They have no treasure.</p>
<p>Characters questioning the kobold servants may make a DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check. If the characters are dressed as cultists and are fairly convincing, no check is required.</p>
<p>Each success brings one of the following bits of information to light; the first failure by any character means that the kobolds unite in their terror of the cultists and go completely silent. If questioned further, they start screaming for help and babbling for mercy: completely useless.</p>
<ul>
<li>An elf vampire lives in the crumbling tower (<strong>area area 18</strong>).</li>
<li>Blagothkus still speaks to his dead wife, and her spirit is the castle&rsquo;s pilot and protector. If the giant dies, all the magic of the castle will be undone.</li>
<li>The human dragon-cult people don&rsquo;t really understand dragons the way that kobolds do. Dragons are fine creatures, but grumpy. They say the treasure here is for the queen of all dragons, to keep her from being grumpy.</li>
<li>A red-robed wizard is working with the cultists, and his room (<strong>area area 12</strong>) is off limits to all kobolds.</li>
<li>The white dragon Cloudchaser loves frozen meat. Toss it into the cavern (area 25) and run!</li>
</ul>

Main Vault</h3><p>The icy &ldquo;core&rdquo; of the castle is hollowed out with tunnels that break the surface at multiple points. The white dragon, Glazhael the Cloudchaser, enters and leaves via a wide funnel-shaped passageway that narrows as it draws closer to the main vault, where the Cult of the Dragon stores its treasure.</p>
<p>If the characters explore the tunnels, read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The walls of blue ice are partly transparent, revealing various things embedded in the ice all around, including coins, helmets, livestock, a handful of kobolds, and an ogre or two. Frost coats the tunnel floors and crunches underfoot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters reach the main vault, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All tunnels seem to lead to a central coreâ€”a glittering cavern of ice with jagged walls and icicles the size of stalactites. This grand vault is split into two levels: an egg-shaped upper level with a sheer ledge overlooking a sunken level 30 feet below, where a massive pile of treasure rests beneath an icy glaze. Clinging to the ceiling above the hoard, wings tucked in tight along its sides with claws gripping the ice, is a huge white dragon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glazhael is an adult white dragon that is doing his part to ensure the rise of Tiamat, hopeful that the queen of evil dragons will reward him with untold power. He is, however, a bit on the dim side, thinking of visitors as either servants (who bring him food) or as enemies (who do not bring him food). Mostly, Glazhael is proud to guard this treasure for Tiamat, his most glorious and perfect queen. He rarely talks to any cultists other than Talis and is suspicious of Rezmir and the others.</p>
<p>If the characters speak with Glazhael, he responds with a pompous speech about the superiority of dragons over humans, dwarves, and so forth.</p>
<p>If the characters flatter him to a ludicrous degree, he listens to anything that sounds like fawning, servile, helpful obedience but offers nothing in return. He will generously spare the lives of those who offer him tribute in the form of treasure or food. Those who challenge him become targets of his breath weapon.</p>
<p>When fighting, Glazhael clings to the ceiling whenever possible, using his breath weapon and Frightful Presence to start. If that doesn&rsquo;t scare the characters off, he makes melee attacks until his breath weapon recharges. If dropped to fewer than 40 hit points, he flees. He can navigate even the narrow tunnels by tucking in his wings. Once outside, he alerts the rest of the castle, shouting &ldquo;They&rsquo;re after the treasure!&rdquo; in Draconic.</p>
<p>Clever characters can lure the dragon into a narrow tunnel where it is unable to maneuver effectively. Under such circumstances, the dragon has disadvantage on its melee attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The floor of the cavern is carpeted in gold, silver, copper, and jewels, all sealed under a sheet of ice. Dozens of old human skulls and bones are also frozen in the ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treasure hoard is frozen in ice, and it requires either several fire spells or a long wait with bonfires to melt the ice. The hoard includes 500,000 cp, 100,000 sp, and 5,000 gp, a frozen chest containing 800 pp and 21 small blue sapphires worth 300 gp each, a frozen <wc-fetch type=item>potion of gaseous form</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type=item>+1 longsword</wc-fetch>, a <wc-fetch type=item>+1 longbow</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=item>+1 leather armor</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=item>bracers of defense</wc-fetch>.</p>

The major cult players on Skyreach Castle will call out the ogres, wake the vampire, and ask the Red Wizards to find the intruders.

<p>The crash or capture of Skyreach Castle marks the end of <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>. If you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 8th level for completing the adventure. By uncovering the cult&rsquo;s plans and hijacking a huge hoard of treasure, the characters have slowed and damaged the cult&rsquo;s chances of success. They may also have slain or captured important leaders of the Cult of the Dragon. But there is much more to come. The cult moves forward with its plan to free their five-headed queen out of the Nine Hells, and the mere loss of wealth will not stop the true fanatics.</p>
<p>The Rise of Tiamat expands on the final drive to destroy the Cult of the Dragon, and it requires great new powers and new courage. Things grow much more dangerous for the adventurers as they seek help in strange places, from the Sea of Moving Ice to the depths of the Serpent Hills. They might find a great weapon among the giants or uncover an unexpected ally within the cult itself.</p>
<p>Unless the characters press on, the Queen of Dragons might yet establish her personal rule over the lands of lesser creatures. The stakes are high when the gates to the Nine Hells open, and scaly doom comes out of its lair, full of fire and fangs.</p>
<p>The conflict reaches its apex at the Well of Dragons, where the characters and their hard-won allies face Tiamat and her greatest minions in a fight to the death!</p>
