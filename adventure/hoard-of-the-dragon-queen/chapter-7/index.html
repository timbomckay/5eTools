<p>Characters who follow Wyrmspeaker Rezmir or Azbara Jos with the aid of the teleportation circle in Castle Naerytar&rsquo;s dungeon are deposited high in the Greypeak Mountains. The change in climate is very stark; the portal and a nearby lodge are buffeted by chill winds, and the surrounding countryside is heavily forested. The portal is one of several that predate the Cult of the Dragon, and it helps the cult leaders gather over large distances.</p>
<p>Next to the portal is a hunting lodge used by a succession of local lords over the years. The lodge is a useful and central meeting place for high-ranking cultists, among them a Wearer of Purple known as Talis the White.</p>
<p>Talis feels strongly that she belongs in Severin&rsquo;s &ldquo;inner circle,&rdquo; but Severin doesn&rsquo;t trust her and recently appointed a dwarf named Varram as his wyrmspeaker in charge of recovering the <wc-fetch type=item>White Dragon Mask</wc-fetch>. The adventurers meet Talis and her servants, and they could end up fighting Talis and her crew in the lodge. They might also bargain and make a deal with Talis, striking against those who oppose her ascension. If they do the latter, she helps the party reach the nearby village of Parnast and aboard Skyreach Castle (see <strong>area chapter 8</strong>)â€”but negotiations are fairly hazardous and might easily result in combat rather than a deal.</p>
<p>If the players don&rsquo;t realize that the cult hopes to bring Tiamat to the Realms, this chapter is the best time for that information to be revealed or confirmed. Although Talis won&rsquo;t mention any details such as masks or summonings, the cultists share a general belief that the time is right for Tiamat&rsquo;s arrival. The characters can find several clues that encourage this belief.</p>

She&rsquo;s been watching the cult&rsquo;s hoard grow, and she hopes to still make her move to become a major figure within the cult hierarchyâ€”certainly she has a lot of support among cultists.</p>
<h3 id=rezmir>

If the characters slew Rezmir, the lodge&rsquo;s relative lack of watchfulness is not surprising.</p>
<p>If Rezmir survived the earlier chapter, the half-dragon meets with Captain Othelstan in Parnast to receive a full report on the status of the cult raids and to inform the captain of the possible arrival of adventurers. Tracking her successfully requires a DC 23 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check. If the adventurers ignore the lodge in favor of following Rezmir to Parnast, skip to chapter 8.</p>

Trepsin cares mostly about combat and mayhem, but he has found that serving the cult makes combat and mayhem more likely. He&rsquo;s very devoted to Talis, and he serves the Cult of the Dragon enthusiastically. His four arms just make it easier to claw, rip, and shred anything too slow to escape his reach. He terrifies the kobolds and the human servants of the lodge.</p>

<p>In addition to their signals, cultists often wear a five-colored band or even use red, blue, and green stripes as coded bits of clothing. A few banners showing cult insignia also exist, but most of those are being held in reserve for the days when the dragons rise to take over. Until then, pass phrases and the salute are the recognition signals most used among Cult of the Dragon members.</p>

<p>This ancient building has a wood and plaster upper floor over a fieldstone lower floor: its shuttered windows are all closed. The roof is completely overgrown with moss. A single door stands slightly open. Smoke pours from one of three large chimneys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lodge stands in a forest, among tall pines and in excellent hunting territory. The building can be accessed through the front door, kitchen door, the shuttered windows (DC 10 Dexterity check or a shutter bangs), or a hole in the moss-covered roof (above <strong>area area 17</strong>) that&rsquo;s visible from the kennel and stables. Climbing up to the hole requires a successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>The drake kennel (<strong>area area 2</strong>) and wyvern stables (<strong>area area 3</strong>) are stone outbuildings located behind the lodge, near a well and a woodpile. Investigating the kennel rouses the loud hissing and peculiar deep growl of drakes, and is one sure way to get the entire lodge&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the peryton nest on the roof (see <strong>area area 22</strong>), directly above <strong>area area 18</strong>.</p>

Those with a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 12 or higher are not surprised by the rush of a group of two Troll and three Ambush Drake (see appendix D for Statistics) that has been wandering the area. The combat alerts Talis that she has company. The trolls serve as the lodge&rsquo;s bouncers, and anyone who is not expected is eaten.</p>

Portal Stones</h3><blockquote>
<p>The mossy stones are old and weathered; lichen covers most of their surfaces, but traces of white paint remain in a few of the grooves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The magical gate to Castle Naerytar sits between a pair of moss-covered standing stones visible from all the front rooms of the lodge. Three other portals near the lodge stand between similar stones, and the cultists have re-tuned their destinations to suit their own ends. One of them connects to the distant north (where Talis visits white dragon allies), one leads to a heavily guarded chamber in Thay, and one leads to the desert of Mulhorand, near a blue dragon lair.</p>
<p>These additional portals should not be a major part of the adventure, but they can introduce cultist nonplayer characters coming to &ldquo;do business at the lodge&rdquo; if the characters decide to dawdle at the lodge for many days. Activating any of these portal stones is unlikely without the lore available in distant libraries or in Rath Modar&rsquo;s chambers in Skyreach Castle (see <strong>area chapter 8</strong>).</p>
<p>The grooves are Draconic letters that spell out words in Loross, the language of Netheril. They mention the &ldquo;snowy lands,&rdquo; an &ldquo;unquiet swamp of mournful croaking,&rdquo; and the lands of the &ldquo;red sun,&rdquo; but provide no place names. Over time, the stones have been used to reach many sites within the Realms.</p>

Hunting Kennel</h3><blockquote>
<p>The stone outbuilding has a mossy roof and no windows. The solid oak doors at either end are 9 feet tall; the whole thing resembles a small barn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opening the door requires a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or a successful DC 20 Strength check; hammering on it brings the occupants over to open it, but they might be a surprise. When the door opens, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The door opens and the smell of rotting flesh wafts out. The creature just inside the door is a four-armed troll in a muddy cloak, holding the leash of a small dragon. &ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; it asks. &ldquo;Show the sign.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/HotDQ/038-tod-07-02.png alt=Trepsin class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>The Trepsin, Trepsin, is asking for the cult&rsquo;s recognition signal. If the characters don&rsquo;t know it or just don&rsquo;t provide it, the troll attacks.</p>
<p>The kennel contains six Ambush Drake (see appendix D for statistics), which the cultists use to track and kill game and intruders. The drakes obey Trepsin as the leader of their pack.</p>
<p>Trepsin wears a mossy and filthy cape that he soaks in water from the well; this provides both good camouflage and partial protection against fire. The muddy cape allows him to ignore the first 10 points of fire damage from any attack or source.</p>
<p>If the characters investigate the interior of the kennels, they find a disturbing altar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the back of the kennels, three boar spears have been lashed together in a rough and strong tripod. An animal carcass hangs from the tripod by a rope: probably a young boar, though the flies make it hard to tell. Beneath it is a bowl circled by runes written in blood.</p>

<p>The runes are written in Giant. Trepsin is a follower of the demon lord Baphomet, lord of hunters and slayers. The strange and rusted spear-altar has rotted meat on it as a sacrifice to the demon lord.</p>

<p>The stout beams overhead are stained black with smoke. A comfortable table and chairs, a small wardrobe, and suit of dull black armor stand in the room. A large tapestry shows three hounds dragging down a white boar, and it shimmers with strange light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The black armor is a helmed horror built to serve the cult, and disguised by an illusion to appear as ordinary armor. It detects as magical and attacks if disturbed or if commanded to do so by Talis or someone else wearing purple Cult of the Dragon robes.</p>
<p>The helmed horror has an <wc-fetch type=spell>Evard&rsquo;s black tentacles</wc-fetch> spell stored in it. It is programmed to cast this spell when confronted by three or more adversaries, and can do so only once. (See the helmed horror&rsquo;s stat block for details on its Spell Storing trait.)</p>
<p>The tapestry is magical and transports those who step through it into the surrounding forest, about five miles from the lodge. It often places the travelers near a deer, mountain goat, or other wild game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This spacious kitchen is a hive of activity. A large stove against one wall contains a roaring fire with a bubbling stew pot and shanks of venison suspended above it. Strings of onions and herbs crisscross the ceiling like webs above cluttered tables. Preparing meals are four humans: two men and two women. All are within arm&rsquo;s reach of boiling water, cleavers, and knives, and their stares make it quite clear they don&rsquo;t like company.</p>

<p>These four Cultist are Talis&rsquo;s servants. They know how to cook, and they can put up a fight. If attacked, one cultist runs to the drake kennels (<strong>area area 2</strong>) to fetch Trepsin and his drakes. Those reinforcements arrive 3 rounds later.</p>

<p>Brother Caemon suspects that Talis is trying to win him over to the cult, but he also fears that Talis plans to sacrifice him as part of a summoning ritual and is trying the &ldquo;catch more flies with honey&rdquo; approach to win his freedom.

<p>This room is warm and comfortable, with a large fireplace, stuffed leather chairs, and a table set with smoked sausages and candles. A tapestry displays a magnificent white stag above a valley, with a pair of green dragons soaring overhead and deer, boars, and hedgehogs hiding among the leaves and trees below.</p>
<p>The walls each have a trophy or two, including two fine mountain goat heads, an elk&rsquo;s head with a 10-point rack, a giant eagle&rsquo;s head and talons, a metallic bull&rsquo;s head, a griffon&rsquo;s head and foreclaws, and the head of a white-furred boar with tusks as long as daggers. The room seems otherwise deserted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The metallic bull&rsquo;s head is a gorgon, and the trophies are all real, though not valuable except as curiosities.</p>

Human Servants</h3><blockquote>
<p>This room contains three beds and a simple writing desk. The room smells clean, and the floorboards are swept spotless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three human servants (Commoner) sleep here when they are not working as the lodge&rsquo;s waiters and greeters. They were hired by the lodge&rsquo;s prior owner, one Lord Marsten, a noble slain by the cult. They are confined to this chamber when not serving Talis. These resentful servants are the chief butler Gastyn, head maid Arlaenga, and former chief hunter and now chief groom Angrath Woodwise. They resent the cultists, especially Trepsin the troll.</p>
<p>The human servants avoid combat, but they spy on every visitor. Arlaenga is trying to ingratiate herself, and she reports back to Talis if she sees anything suspicious.</p>
<p>The servants are willing to tell the adventurers about the troll in the kennels (<strong>area area 2</strong>) and the room where the whole cult comes to plot (<strong>area area 20</strong>). They also know that the perytons can be placated with food (<strong>area area 22</strong>), and that the cult keeps a valuable banner in the linens (<strong>area area 15</strong>). Most of all, though, they say they&rsquo;ve seen &ldquo;a castle in the sky near Parnast.&rdquo;</p>

Talis&rsquo;s Hall</h3><blockquote>
<p>What looks to be a well-appointed chamber is filled with furniture and can serve as a place to eat food or discuss important matters. Three men in the room wear scale mail and carry swords; a woman wears robes over white scale mail, and she holds a wand set with a blue gemstone. &ldquo;Welcome. I consider you to be my guests. Perhaps we can do business.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This encounter is the classic scene where the villain explains herself if the players are willing to pause.</p>
<p>Talis the White (See appendix D for statistics). She stands behind her bodyguards and uses a <wc-fetch type=item>wand of winter</wc-fetch> (see appendix C). Talis&rsquo;s bodyguards include two human Veteran named Maelgot and Sorvic, and a dragonclaw (see appendix D) named Kusphia. If Talis is slain, the veterans surrender, but Kusphia fights to the death to avenge her slain mistress.</p>
<p>Talis expects to meet some co-conspirators at the lodge to discuss various matters of her own ascendancy in the ranks. If the characters can be turned to her advantage, she would much rather send them against her rival than fight them. At the same time, she knows she cannot be seen as disloyal to the cult&rsquo;s interests.</p>

</span></p>
<p>If the characters accept her surrender, she shares the following information as long as the character questioning her continues to make a sequence of successful DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) rolls. Once a roll is failed, she clams upâ€”at least until she is bribed, threatened, or offered other information in exchange.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talis identifies the five leaders of the cult as &ldquo;wyrmspeakers,&rdquo; each of whom has an affinity for a particular kind of chromatic dragon. The leaders' names are Severin the Red, Galvan the Blue, Neronvain the Green, Rezmir the Black, and Varram the White.</li>
<li>She explains the significance of the banner in <strong>area area 15</strong> and reveals the various cult signs and signals (see the sidebar at the start of the chapter).</li>
<li>If that is not sufficient, she tells them that the cult has an enormous hoard of valuables in a flying castle hidden nearbyâ€”but not for long. If pressed for details, Talis reveals that castle belongs to a cloud giant allied with the cult. The castle, she says, is hidden near the village of Parnast, which is under the cult&rsquo;s control.</li>
<li>If all that is not enough, she tells the party, in glowing and worshipful tones, that a great white dragon inhabits the castle. She refers to the dragon as &ldquo;snow-white Glazhael, the Cloudchaser, a handsome dragon of the pure northern breed.&rdquo; She sounds like a fanatic when discussing dragonkind.</li>
<li>She doesn&rsquo;t know much about the Red Wizards but reveals that a Red Wizard liaison has been sent to help arrange the hoard&rsquo;s transport to the cult&rsquo;s headquarters.</li>
<li>She might be willing to tell the party the cult and its allies are building an army in the Sunset Mountains far to the south, in anticipation of Tiamat&rsquo;s arrival.</li>

<p>The shutters are open, allowing light to shine in. Four unmade beds line the south wall, and other furnishings include a table with four chairs and a wine rack containing a multitude of bottles, most of them uncorked and empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The veterans who serve Talis have taken these well-furnished quarters for their own: they are Maelgot, Sorvic, and Wessic the Wizened. Wessic, a human veteran of sixty years, is resting here the first time the characters show up; the others are in <strong>area area 16</strong>. Wessic sleeps in his armor and keeps his weapon stowed under his bed, within easy reach. If awakened, he fights fiercely and shouts loudly for help; this usually brings Talis and the other guards, but not the Trepsin the troll or the lodge&rsquo;s human and kobold servants. If reduced to half his hit points, he attempts to surrender.</p>

Queen of Dragons Chamber</h3><blockquote>
<p>A roaring fireplace churns out heat and light at one end of this spacious, 30-foot-high chamber, the ceiling of which is buttressed by ten wooden pillars carved as dragons. Five large tapestries hang along the wallsâ€”two on the west wall flanking a door, two on the east wall hanging side by side, and a particularly grand one dominating the south wall next to the fireplace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a feast hall, this room is now set aside for cult gatherings and is currently unoccupied. A set of double doors in the north wall pulls open to reveal a stone balcony overlooking the stables, kennel, and well (see <strong>area areas 2</strong> and <strong>area 3</strong> for details).</p>

Each is worth at least 500 gp to the right buyer, but each also weighs about 75 pounds and is extremely cumbersome.</p>
<p>The fifth tapestry shows Tiamat, the queen of evil dragons, in all her glory, crowned in gold and silver, and worked with gemstones and gold and silver thread. Fully 35 feet wide and 20 feet tall, it shows Tiamat crushing cities and surrounded by adoring followers. The tapestry weighs about 200 pounds and is worth 2,500 gp. Simply removing the semiprecious stones provides garnets, agates, moonstones, and others worth about 800 gp.</p>
<p>Close examination of the tapestries and a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check reveals their locations in the Sword Coast region. The blue dragons are attacking a caravan crossing the desert of Anauroch, the white and black dragons are circling above the Mere of Dead Men, the red dragon is near Waterdeep, and the green dragon is clearly rampaging among the High Forest elves, based on the mountains in the background. Tiamat herself is shown with what are clearly Waterdeep, Neverwinter, and Baldur&rsquo;s Gate in her claws.</p>

<p>This large nest on the roof is made of woven sticks, leaves, and feathers intermingled with the sun-bleached bones of sizable animals: deer, bear, or mountain goat, perhaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nest abuts a chimney that leads down to Talis&rsquo;s bedchamber (<strong>area area 18</strong>) and belongs to a mated pair of Peryton. Several times during the day, the perytons leave their nest to hunt for food. There&rsquo;s a 50 percent chance that the nest is empty during the day; at night, both perytons are roosting here.</p>
<p>The perytons are allies of the cult and have a clear view of the portals in front of the lodge (<strong>area area 1</strong>). They cannot see the stables or kennels (<strong>area areas 2</strong> and<strong>area 3</strong>) from the nest.</p>

At the start of its turn or whenever it takes damage, a creature standing on the roof must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature falls <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> on the roof; if the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature slips and falls off the roof, taking <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> bludgeoning damage and landing <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> on the ground.</p>
