<p>Manshoon yearns to rule Waterdeep as a tyrant, take over the Zhentarim, and use both seats of power to plunder and control the Sword Coast. He needs the gold in the Vault of Dragons to pay off Masked Lords and Zhentarim leaders whose support will be instrumental when the time comes to oust Lady Laeral Silverhand as Open Lord. Manshoon has a long list of powerful enemies, among them the Harpers, Elminster of Shadowdale, Halaster Blackcloak of Undermountain, and the Blackstaff of Waterdeep. These enemies would quickly move against Manshoon if they learned he was hiding in Waterdeep. For his evil plans to succeed, Manshoon must operate in the shadows for the time being.</p>

That said, the wizard&rsquo;s greatest weakness is that he has powerful enemies in Waterdeep. The risk of exposure keeps him hidden, and the characters can thwart him by furnishing his enemies with proof that he&rsquo;s alive (after a fashion) and operating in Waterdeep. When it comes to Manshoon clones, deciding to &ldquo;let the city deal with it&rdquo; is a wise course of action.</p>
<p>If the characters find themselves at the evil wizard&rsquo;s mercy, Manshoon will gladly trade their pitiful lives for the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> and the keys to unlock the Vault of Dragons. In exchange for helping him get the gold, he promises the characters 10 percent of the trove (50,000 gp). Manshoon has no intention of honoring this agreement, but it can help buy the characters some time.</p>
<p>If the characters manage to kill Manshoon and the local authorities are made aware of the act, no murder charges are filed. Rather, the characters' actions are celebrated. Laeral Silverhand summons them to the Palace of Waterdeep to thank them officially, in her capacity as Open Lord. Sometime later, Vajra Safahr invites them to Blackstaff Tower to thank them for their service and offer them membership in Force Grey.</p>

<h4 id=release-the-barlgura>
<a href=#release-the-barlgura class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Release the Barlgura</h4><p>If the characters free the barlgura demon in <strong>area K15</strong> and allow it to roam Kolat Towers, Manshoon loses many followers to the demon&rsquo;s rampage.</p>
<h4 id=report-manshoon>
<a href=#report-manshoon class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Report Manshoon</h4><p>Delivering proof that Manshoon is hiding in Waterdeep to Laeral Silverhand, Mirt, the Harpers, Force Grey, the Blackstaff, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, the City Watch, or the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors triggers a far-reaching effort to oust him from the city. Such proof can be obtained from any of Manshoon&rsquo;s lieutenants, who can be captured and turned over for interrogation. These lieutenants include Sidra Romeir (<strong>area K2</strong>), Manafret Cherryport (<strong>area K3</strong>), Urstul Floxin (<strong>area E5</strong>), Vevette Blackwater and Agorn Fuoco (<strong>area E8</strong>), and Zhent Martial Arts Adept and Zhent Martial Arts Adept (<strong>area E10</strong>).</p>
<p>The ledger in <strong>area E13</strong> also contains proof of Manshoon&rsquo;s malfeasance. Giving it to Laeral Silverhand, Vajra Safahr, Mirt, or a magister provides enough evidence for them to act on.</p>
<p>Once Manshoon&rsquo;s whereabouts are established, the City Guard cordons off and surrounds Kolat Towers. The Blackstaff and the Watchful Order assist as needed. If the characters deactivated the force field, the siege is brief and Manshoon&rsquo;s forces are routed. If the force field remains in place, the Watchful Order can deactivate it.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, Manshoon is forced to retreat to his extradimensional sanctum. From there, he continues his search for the Vault of Dragons while fending off attackers.</p>

<p>This dilapidated, two-towered edifice stands tall in the Southern Ward. Its neighbors are aware of the magical force field that surrounds it, and they can see light from <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells spilling out of the windows. Despite these persistent magical effects, most folk believe the structure is abandoned. Others think it&rsquo;s haunted by the ghosts of the Kolat brothers. They&rsquo;re wrong, of course.</p>
<p>Manshoon posts no visible guards outside Kolat Towers, since he wants others to believe the site is abandoned. The evil wizard and his underlings come and go using teleportation circles inside the towers.</p>

The field is paper-thin and stands just outside the outer wall of the estate, extending upward to contain the buildings in their entirety. Nothing can pass through the barrier, including air, fog, rain, and snow. Creatures that don&rsquo;t realize the field is there bounce off it, with birds especially <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> to striking it. The ground outside the field is regularly littered with the tiny corpses of birds that broke their necks hitting it, and street cleaners come by every morning to sweep them up.</p>

It takes 1 hour for a character with a shovel to dig a hole deep enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through, going under the field to the other side of the towers' outer wall. Since Kolat Towers is surrounded by other buildings, there&rsquo;s a <wc-roll chance>75|75 percent chance percent</wc-roll> that any digging attracts <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> members of the City Watch (veteran), who put a stop to it.</p>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch> spell or a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (DC 19) spell cast at the field creates a 10-foot-square opening that lasts for 1 minute.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kolat Towers is a multistory structure, with each level standing 20 feet higher than the one below it. Its rooms have 15-foot-high ceilings, with 7-foot-high doorways connecting them.</li>
<li>Climbing the outside walls without equipment requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.</li>
<li>Each of the doors in the towers, as well as the door in the outer wall, is made of iron-bound oak and has AC 16, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If a door is locked, it can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or it can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Manshoon, Manafret Cherryport, and Zhent Martial Arts Adept have keys to the locked doors.</li>
<li>Windows have leaded frames and dirty glass panes. They are latched from within and swing inward on iron hinges. A successful DC 11 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens a window from the outside.</li>
<li>Unless otherwise noted, all areas are brightly lit by <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> spells cast on wall sconces.</li>
<li>Some of the staircases in Kolat Towers are invisible. They are revealed by a <wc-fetch type=spell>see invisibility</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. A creature traversing stairs it can&rsquo;t see can move on the steps at half speed without any problem. A creature that moves any faster than half speed must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or slip, tumble down the stairs, and fall <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> at the bottom of them.</li>
</ul>

An NPC familiar with Waterdeep&rsquo;s history, such as Mirt or Volo, can also provide this information.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kolat Towers once belonged to two eccentric brothers, Duhlark and Alcedor Kolat. Both were wizards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, the brothers discovered new ways to harness magic, but Duhlark became paranoid that others might steal their secrets. He encased Kolat Towers in a magical force field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duhlark&rsquo;s paranoia continued to grow, until he suspected Alcedor of selling their secrets. Alcedor left the towers, never to be heard from again, and Duhlark became a recluse who died in his own fortress.</p>
</li>

The first time a character steps onto the landing, the statue levitates 1 foot above the ledge and intones the following warning in Common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am Duhlark Kolat, the great wizard and master of this tower! How dare you invade my home! Leave at once or be destroyed by magic beyond your comprehension!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The threat is empty, but the statue continues to levitate for 1 minute before sinking back down to the ledge. The magic resets after 1 hour. While it is levitating, the statue can be easily pushed or pulled around.</p>
<p>Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on the statue while it&rsquo;s floating causes it to fall, topple off the ledge, and shatter in <strong>area K5</strong> below. Anyone in that area when the statue falls must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage.</p>

This gargoyle has an Intelligence score of 10 and an alignment of lawful good. It speaks Common, and its face looks more humanoid than gargoyle. Manshoon is amused by the creature, so he keeps it alive but locked in the cell.</p>
<p>If the characters free Lady Gondafrey, she offers to fight alongside them; however, she quickly turns against any character who exhibits cruel or unlawful behavior. She can offer helpful information about Kolat Towers, and she is familiar with both the layout of the towers and the current occupants of the place. She knows that Manshoon resides in an extraplanar sanctum accessible through a teleportation circle that his lieutenants can activate using special rings. The gargoyle doesn&rsquo;t know where the teleportation circle is located, nor does she know why Duhlark transferred her consciousness into her present form.</p>
<p>The gargoyle retains fragmented memories of the life of Lady Gondafrey, a native Waterdavian who served in the City Watch. After identifying Duhlark Kolat as a suspect in several local disappearances, she darkened his doorstep in 1379 DR, the Year of the Lost Keep. Annoyed by this invasion of his privacy and not in his right mind, Duhlark captured Lady Gondafrey, used a spell to meld her form with that of a gargoyle, and imprisoned her.</p>
<p>If the gargoyle travels with the party, roll a <wc-roll>d10</wc-roll> each day at dawn. On a roll of 1, Lady Gondafrey&rsquo;s alignment becomes chaotic evil for 24 hours as the gargoyle&rsquo;s innate demeanor exerts itself. In this state, the creature tries to orchestrate the characters' deaths, going so far as to attack lone characters.</p>

<p>This room is connected to the levels above and below by invisible staircases (see &ldquo;Kolat Towers Features&rdquo;), one descending 20 feet to <strong>area K11</strong> and the other climbing 20 feet to <strong>area K16</strong>. This area contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 10-foot-diameter circle of runes has been drawn on the floor in blood that is now dried. Smoke billows from four iron braziers placed around the circle.</li>
<li>Three apprentice wizard (see appendix B) stand outside the circle, chanting an incantation. A barlgura is slumped motionless within the circle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three wizards here are Manshoon&rsquo;s apprenticesâ€”Ered Payno (LE male Damaran human), Havi Termock (CE female Chondathan human), and Savara Firethorn (NE female Tethyrian human). Each wears a teleporter ring (see &ldquo;Teleporter Rings&rdquo;). The magical incantation that the three are reciting has quelled the barlgura and rendered it <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>. If any of them stop chanting, the demon awakes and becomes enraged, though it remains bound within the circle. Whenever it takes damage, the barlgura can attempt a DC 10 Charisma check. On a successful check, it breaks out of the circle and attacks any creature it can reach.</p>
<p>Freeing the barlgura disrupts Manshoon&rsquo;s operation, forcing the wizard to spend time and resources defeating the fiend and replacing slain underlings.</p>

<p>The invisible staircase from <strong>area K15</strong> ends in front of a closed door. The door is unlocked and opens into the room, which contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bits of clay, stone, bone, and metal litter the floor and cover a wooden table in the middle of the room.</li>
<li>The floor creaks and tilts slightly when stepped on, and it can be seen to be detached from the walls. Two oversized iron clamps on opposite sides of the room hold the floor in place. Each of these rusty mechanisms is attached to an iron lever.</li>
<li>A wooden staircase once climbed 20 feet to the next level, but it has partially collapsed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kolat brothers once crafted constructs in this workshop. The magical clamped floor was built as a precaution in case one of the experiments went berserk.</p>
<p>When a creature that doesn&rsquo;t work for Manshoon&rsquo;s Zhentarim enters this room without being escorted, the metal scraps on the floor fly together, forming a suit of animated armor that attacks. When the armor is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, it tries to pull one of the levers on its next turn.</p>

Creatures standing on the floor are knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> and must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw as they slam into the ceiling, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The floor then settles a few feet below the ceiling, cutting off access to the stairs down to <strong>area K15</strong> but leaving characters free to climb up the collapsed staircase to <strong>area K17</strong>. (The magical floor was designed to prevent a berserk golem from reaching the lower chambers of the towers, and potentially the city beyond, while the Kolat brothers dealt with it.) After 10 minutes, the floor descends to its normal level and the clamps lock it down again.</p>

<p>This unlit hallway contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any character who inspects the hall for traps and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check notices 1-inch-diameter holes drilled into the walls at ankle height, set at regular intervals along the length of the passage.</li>

Manshoon chose to leave it here and instructed his lieutenants not to disturb it. It moves to attack anyone other than Duhlark who approaches within 10 feet of it. A character disguised as Duhlark (using the statue in <strong>area K10</strong> as a model) can fool the golem with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check.</p>
<p>The golem stands on a pressure plate. When it steps off the plate to attack someone out of its reach, the weight on the plate is lifted, causing poison gas to erupt from the holes in the walls. When the trap triggers, each creature in the hall must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The gas lingers for 1 minute unless dispersed with a <wc-fetch type=spell>gust of wind</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. While the gas persists, a creature in the hall must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. The golem is immune to the poison gas.</p>

A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check confirms that this rune sustains the force field around Kolat Towers, and that the rune can be destroyed. It has AC 10, 22 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The rune can&rsquo;t be dispelled normally, but each successful dispel magic cast on it (DC 19) deals 16 (<wc-roll>3d10</wc-roll>) force damage to it.</p>
<p>The first time damage is dealt to the rune, a red slaad magically springs forth from it and attacks all creatures in the hallway.</p>
<p>When the rune is destroyed, the force field around Kolat Towers disappears.</p>

<li>An oval canopy bed veiled in cobwebs sits across from two narrow bookshelves.</li>
<li>The room smells like a tomb.</li>
</ul>
<p>Manshoon found Duhlark Kolat&rsquo;s skeletal remains in the bed and transformed his skull into a flameskull. He left the rest of the bones alone, hidden behind cobwebs. The flameskull attacks anyone other than Manshoon who confronts it, shouting, &ldquo;Get out of my house!&rdquo; between casting spells and throwing off fire rays.</p>

<p>Among the volumes on one shelf is a false book titled <em>The Man from Damara</em>â€”a wooden block painted to resemble a book, which is wired to a secret compartment in the base of the shelf. A character can detect the shelf and discern how to open it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

<p>Outside Manshoon&rsquo;s sanctum, the demiplane is a vast void filled with swirling purple mist. Any creature that enters this mist is teleported to <strong>area E1</strong> and must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

He is being punished for allowing the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to slip through his fingers (during the events of chapter 3). Nevertheless, he remains loyal to Manshoon. If he is confronted, Urstul feigns anger toward the wizard and offers to help the characters defeat him, but this ruse can be seen through by someone who makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check. Given the chance, Urstul leads the characters to Manshoon, then attacks them to prove his unwavering loyalty in front of his master.</p>
<p>If the characters fall for Urstul&rsquo;s ruse but nevertheless demand that he relinquish his weapons in order to accompany them, the Zhent assassin laughs at them and attacks.</p>

<p>No one aside from Manshoon is allowed down here. The alabaster stairs that lead to this room descend 10 feet farther to <strong>area E13</strong>.</p>
<p>This room contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Across from the stairs stands a large bed with purple sheets. Sitting on the edge of the bed is a handsome young male human in elegant robes. Long black hair partially conceals his angelic face as he attaches a metal appendage to the withered stump of his left arm.</li>
<li>The only other piece of furniture is a table with legs carved to resemble winged serpents. Displayed on the table is a metal mask with an intimidating, tyrannical visage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The handsome young figure is Manshoon (see appendix B), who is much older than he looks.</p>
<p>This version of Manshoon isn&rsquo;t spoiling for a fight. He commends the characters for making it this far and shows no concern for the Zhents they defeated to reach him, since he considers all his followers expendable.</p>
<p>The characters' best chance of survival is to convince Manshoon that they can be cowed or bribed into working for him. Weary of his conflict with the Xanathar Guild, Manshoon suggests that the characters prove their usefulness to him by hunting down and killing Xanathar in its lair (see chapter 5). Manshoon also demands that they keep his presence in Waterdeep a secret for now, saying that he will reward them for their discretion &ldquo;when the time comes.&rdquo; In exchange, he allows the characters to return to Waterdeep and promises them positions of power in his organization once Xanathar&rsquo;s death is confirmed. He has no intention of making good on this promise, but refusing to work for him puts the characters in a tight spot, since the evil archwizard can&rsquo;t risk exposure.</p>
<p>If a fight breaks out, Manshoon grabs his <wc-fetch type=item>staff of power</wc-fetch> (which he hides under the bed) and holds his ground. For more information on how to play Manshoon, see &ldquo;Facing Manshoon&rdquo; at the beginning of this chapter.</p>

Manshoon&rsquo;s Study</h4><p>The alabaster stairs end here. The room contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A plush lavender carpet covers the floor.</li>
<li>In one far corner of the room, a low table is set between two purple couches. The table has a thin drawer built into it.</li>
<li>In the other far corner, Manshoon&rsquo;s spellbook rests atop a black marble lectern protected by an <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> helmed horror. The construct attacks anyone other than Manshoon who disturbs the book (becoming visible as it does so). It obeys Manshoon&rsquo;s commands if he is present, and it fights until destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=table>
<a href=#table class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Table</h5><p>The table&rsquo;s drawer has an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell cast on it. The spell can be bypassed by someone who makes a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. The drawer can also be forced open with a successful DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check. Inside is a leather-bound ledger that provides a paper trail implicating Manshoon in two blackmail schemes. An hour spent studying the ledger uncovers the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corylus Thann, a racist Waterdavian noble, is paying the Zhentarim not to reveal that he hired Zhent thugs to assault non-humans.</li>
<li>Jelenn Urmbrusk, a Waterdavian noble, receives regular payments from the Zhentarim to offset monies he loses in bad investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ledger doesn&rsquo;t reveal that Corylus Thann and Jelenn Urmbrusk are Masked Lords, or that Manshoon&rsquo;s blackmail of them also forces them to use their influence to cover up or dismiss crimes perpetrated by Manshoon&rsquo;s forces in Waterdeep. If the authorities obtain the ledger, they round up anyone suspected of having ties to Manshoon or the Zhentarim, which disrupts the wizard&rsquo;s operation (see &ldquo;Disrupting Manshoon&rsquo;s Operation&rdquo;). Surprisingly, neither Corylus nor Jelenn is arrested or even questioned.</p>
<p>Slipped into the ledger is a piece of paper with a list of names in Manshoon&rsquo;s handwriting. Manshoon keeps this list of Masked Lords whose identities he knows, with check marks indicating the ones he&rsquo;s blackmailing:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

Stealing or destroying this spellbook disrupts Manshoon&rsquo;s operation (see &ldquo;Disrupting Manshoon&rsquo;s Operation&rdquo;), since he must devote time and resources to retrieving or replacing it.</p>
<p>If Laeral Silverhand has the opportunity to trade for Manshoon&rsquo;s spellbook, she offers the characters a <wc-fetch type=item>sailing ship</wc-fetch> and a set of <wc-fetch type=item>bracers of archery</wc-fetch> for it. Vajra Safahr offers the characters membership in Force Grey, a <wc-fetch type=item>cape of the mountebank</wc-fetch>, and a <wc-fetch type=item>wand of lightning bolts</wc-fetch> for the book.</p>

The Thann and Umbrusk families have walled estates in the Sea Ward.</p>
<h4 id=corylus-thann>

Corylus (LE male Tethyrian human noble) is happy to let other members of his family manage the wine business while he focuses on his duties as a Masked Lord. Unfortunately, he lacks the principles and sound judgment that have led to House Thann&rsquo;s success in the past. He also places the welfare of humans above non-humans. In the past, he has used Zhentarim thugs to inflict harm on non-humans who sought positions of political power in the city. Now the Zhents are blackmailing Corylus, threatening to expose his bigotry unless he uses his influence as a Masked Lord to cover up their illegal activities.</p>
<p>The characters are most likely to encounter Corylus as he travels through the city by coach, accompanied by six human guard who watch his back and keep the rabble at bay. Corylus refuses to speak with the party. If the characters become an annoyance, he has eight crooked members of the City Watch (human veteran) crack down on them, then uses his position as Masked Lord to clear any charges leveled against these Watch members. Corylus refuses to be indebted to anyone, so any attempt by the characters to curry favor with him is met with suspicion, if not outright hostility. Even if they dispose of Manshoon, Corylus refuses to acknowledge that he owes them anything.</p>
<h4 id=jelenn-urmbrusk>
<a href=#jelenn-urmbrusk class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Jelenn Urmbrusk</h4><p>Jelenn (N female Tethyrian human noble) is a proud woman in her fifties who desperately wants to get out of debt. Several bad investments ruined her money-lending business, and most of her reliable customers have turned to other providers such as the Cassalanters. Jelenn could have borrowed money from any of a number of nobles in the city or sold off some of the property her family owns in Waterdeep, but doing so would have turned her private financial woes into local gossip. Fear of that exposure led her to borrow money from the Zhentarim insteadâ€”a decision she has come to regret. The Zhents working for Manshoon promise to keep their relationship secret on the condition that she do everything in her power to further the group&rsquo;s welfare in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>When not dealing with her slimy creditors, Jelenn is occupied with Masked Lord business. She has no time for a face-to-face meeting with anyone she doesn&rsquo;t know. Characters can confront her as she comes or goes to and from her villa, but she never travels without sixteen guard who form a protective wall around her. If the characters brazenly mention Manshoon or the Zhentarim by name to her, Jelenn demands that they leave her alone or face dire consequences. Jelenn&rsquo;s threat is mostly bluster, since she&rsquo;s not eager to make enemies.</p>
<p>If the characters free Jelenn from the yoke of the Black Network by defeating Manshoon, her debt is effectively canceled. In her delight, she grants them a special favor (see &ldquo;Special Favors&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). On the other hand, if they threaten to go to the press with Manshoon&rsquo;s ledger in an attempt to blackmail or discredit her, she pretends to go along with them while secretly using her influence as a Masked Lord to make their lives difficult.</p>

Broxley Fairkettle (see &ldquo;Sample Guild Representatives&rdquo;), asks the characters if they would be willing to host the feast in their tavern. He believes the gesture would be appreciated by their neighbors, in light of the recent deaths in the area (see chapter 3).</p>
<p>If the characters offer up their tavern for the feast, guild representatives arrive to stock and decorate it for the event. During the three days before the holiday, the tavern is bustling with activity and excitement. Hundreds show up on the day of the feast to partakeâ€”not only residents of Trollskull Alley, but also folk from neighboring streets. There&rsquo;s plenty of food to go around, but the tavern practically groans under the weight of the crowd, and additional tables are set up outside to handle the overflow. People don&rsquo;t appear to mind, even as heavy snow begins to fall. Members of the City Watch are on hand to make sure everyone behaves.</p>
<p>Nothing violent happens during the Deadwinter Day feast, but the tavern suffers damage as a result of the crowds. The Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild offers to make repairs for free, but the characters must close the establishment for a tenday to facilitate the work. The closure has no effect on business in the long term, however, since the feast fosters such goodwill that clients return in force when the tavern reopens.</p>
<p>The feast is a great opportunity for characters to hobnob with neighbors, guild members, and City Watch constables, as well as to gather information on local happenings.</p>

If one of the players is absent for a game session and circumstances allow it, Manshoon targets that character for replacement while the rest of the party is distracted by other matters. You don&rsquo;t need to roleplay the character&rsquo;s capture; just assume it happens. To create a simulacrum of the character, Manshoon needs some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of the character&rsquo;s body. Once he obtains the necessary components from the captured character, he creates the simulacrum and sends it to the party with instructions to spy on the group and undermine it from within.</p>
<p>If Manshoon embeds a simulacrum within the party, talk privately to the player whose character has been replaced. Then have that player run the simulacrum until it is destroyed or the character it replaced is reintroduced. The simulacrum has the same statistics as the character, but it has only half the character&rsquo;s hit point maximum and can&rsquo;t gain levels.</p>
