<p>Xanathar has let its paranoia get the better of it, and the beholder trusts no one. The <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> disappeared from its lair while it was brokering a deal that would have merged the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim into a single criminal organization. Although the Zhents didn&rsquo;t steal the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, Xanathar believes they did. Once content to merely possess the stone, the beholder is no longer confident of the gold&rsquo;s safety in the Vault of Dragons. Xanathar thinks that the gold would be safer under its watchful gaze, but without the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, it can&rsquo;t remember where the gold is hidden.</p>
<p>Before running this chapter, review the &ldquo;Beholders&rdquo; section of the Monster Manual, particularly the section titled &ldquo;A Beholder&rsquo;s Lair.&rdquo; Within its lair, Xanathar has access to lair actions, and characters might encounter the beholder&rsquo;s regional effects as well.</p>
<p>Characters who don&rsquo;t visit Xanathar&rsquo;s lair in the course of this adventure might have reason to do so in <em>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</em>. In that adventure, the characters are most likely to approach the beholder&rsquo;s lair from Skullport (see <strong>area X4</strong> for details).</p>
<p>As they explore Xanathar&rsquo;s lair, characters will see a recurring symbol that looks like a circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference. This symbol is Xanathar&rsquo;s personal rune as well as the symbol used to represent the Xanathar Guild.</p>

<p>If the characters attack the beholder, it destroys one character and tries to subjugate the rest. In exchange for their lives, the survivors must agree to help the beholder find the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>. If they refuse, the beholder destroys another character and repeats the offer. This process continues until the characters comply or none are left. Those who agree to the beholder&rsquo;s terms are permitted to leave with their lives.</p>
<p>If the characters give Xanathar the stone, it demands that they accompany it to the Vault of Dragons and help it defeat the vault&rsquo;s draconic guardian. Not fully trusting the characters to keep their part of the bargain, Xanathar brings along its majordomo, Ahmaergo, to keep an eye on them.</p>
<p>If Xanathar is reduced to half its maximum hit points, or if it believes its life to be in mortal danger, it activates its <wc-fetch type=item>ring of invisibility</wc-fetch> and howls to Ahmaergo to &ldquo;tear the usurpers limb from limb.&rdquo; While <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>, Xanathar flies to its sanctum (<strong>area X19</strong>) by the safest route.</p>
<p>Xanathar&rsquo;s greatest weakness is its insane love for its pet fish, Sylgar. A character who uses the fish for leverage can make a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation) check. On a success, the fearsome beholder becomes a blubbering mess and acquiesces to almost any request the character makes. On a failure, Xanathar demands that the character release Sylgar at once or be disintegrated (and makes good on its threat).</p>

Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe knows that the safest route to the beholder&rsquo;s lair is a secret staircase in the sewers of the Castle Ward. Any character who belongs to this faction can get this information from Jarlaxle or another source.</p>
<p>If the party includes at least one Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe member with renown of 4 or more in the faction, four male drow are waiting for the party at the top of the staircase. Their names are Arannis Nur&rsquo;zekk, Beldar Tlabbath, Rylvar Tlabbath, and Draknafein Uriss. Their orders are to help the characters complete their mission, whatever the cost. These drow also have secret orders to kill Nar&rsquo;l Xibrindas, if he&rsquo;s still alive, and retrieve Jarlaxle&rsquo;s bag of holding (see <strong>area X35</strong>). If you&rsquo;re tracking experience points, each drow gets an equal share of the XP while a member of the adventuring party.</p>

<p>Mirt leads the characters to a secret staircase in the Castle Ward sewers (<strong>area X1</strong>). As the characters prepare to descend the stairs, Mirt tells them that Xanathar doesn&rsquo;t relate well to humanoids, doesn&rsquo;t trust them as a matter of course, and is <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> to imagining conspiracies where none exist. He also tells the characters that Xanathar has a pet fish and is insanely protective of it.</p>
<p>Mirt won&rsquo;t accompany the adventurers, but he knows a secret that could be helpful: Thorvin Twinbeard, Xanathar&rsquo;s chief engineer, is a Harper informant. Mirt shares this secret with any character who has renown of 4 or higher in the Harper faction.</p>

She recently learned about a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; to the beholder&rsquo;s lair from a drunken blabbermouth with ties to the Xanathar Guild. Yagra offers to lead them to a secret staircase in the sewers under the Castle Ward (<strong>area X1</strong>). &ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s safer than the route through Undermountain and Skullport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yagra will join their descent if the characters promise to pay her at least 1,000 gp. Otherwise, she wishes them well and heads back to the Yawning Portal. If you&rsquo;re tracking experience points, Yagra gets an equal share of the XP while a member of the adventuring party.</p>

This staircase circumvents a more difficult route through Undermountain and Skullport, which is described in <em>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</em>.</p>
<p>When the characters find the staircase, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The walls of this narrow, spiraling staircase are carved with opened eyes that glow with a faint, magical light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters feel as though they&rsquo;re being watched as they descend the stairs, and the feeling doesn&rsquo;t go away once they enter the beholder&rsquo;s lair.

All five creatures float in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>The beholder zombie is all that remains of a beholder that arose from the Underdark to challenge Xanathar&rsquo;s supremacy. After defeating its rival, Xanathar had the corpse animated and transformed into a lair guardian. The gas spores were added later.</p>
<p>The beholder zombie allows creatures that brandish the symbol of Xanathar to pass unmolested. Otherwise, it attacks. The gas spores don&rsquo;t attack but explode if they take any damage. The beholder zombie is immune to their Death Burst trait.</p>

Pit of Blood and Fortune</h4><p>Xanathar has turned this room into a gladiatorial arena. It also uses this location to dispose of underlings it no longer trusts in a manner that it considers entertaining.</p>
<p>This area has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A magically lit, circular chamber has a thin layer of blood-soaked sand covering the floor and stone buttresses supporting its 40-foot-high domed ceiling.</li>
<li>Ten-foot-high stone bleachers hug the northwest half of the room. Staircases lead from the bleachers to other areas of the lair, and a tunnel under the bleachers leads west to the monster cell block (<strong>area X7</strong>).</li>
<li>A semicircular recess in the southeast wall has steps leading up to it. Its floor is 5 feet higher than the arena floor, and the alcove is decorated with bouquets of Underdark fungi in stone vases and purple tapestries that bear Xanathar&rsquo;s symbol. Jutting from the curved roof of the alcove is a spectral eyestalk (scrying sensor).</li>
<li>A secret door is hidden in the south wall.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Xanathar is elsewhere, the arena is empty but under surveillance (see &ldquo;Scrying Sensor&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>If Xanathar is present, it hovers in the southeast alcove and uses its <wc-fetch type=item>ring of invisibility</wc-fetch> to remain unseen.

The halfling doesn&rsquo;t want to die in a pointless battle and screams for help. If the characters intervene, the arena spectators turn violent and attack them. If the characters let the fight play out, Noska escorts the victor back to <strong>area X7</strong> while Ahmaergo goads characters into joining the tournament.

<p>Rules for running a tournament are described at the end of this chapter (see &ldquo;Blood and Fortune&rdquo;). If a character joins the tournament and wins, or defeats its underlings, Xanathar is impressed enough to grant the party an audience, during which it tries to subjugate them (see &ldquo;Facing Xanathar,").</p>

Ahmaergo&rsquo;s Quarters</h4><p>The magical lights in this room have been dispelled, rendering the chamber dark. Characters who have a light source or darkvision can discern the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The room has been converted into a maze, its walls made of stacked crates nailed together with boards. The walls rise to meet the 20-foot-high ceiling.</li>
<li>Humanoid bones litter the floor. (Ahmaergo gathered the bones from Undermountain and put them here as grisly decorations.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The maze fills the entire room but for a 10-foot-square area in the southwest corner, where Ahmaergo keeps a wooden chest and a bed made from the skulls, bones, hide, and fur of minotaurs.</p>
<p>Getting through the maze takes time but isn&rsquo;t difficult, except that Ahmaergo has rigged a tripwire halfway through. A character in the lead who is searching for traps spots the tripwire with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. Once spotted, it can easily be avoided or disarmed. If the trap is triggered, the walls of the maze come crashing down. Every creature in the collapsing maze is hit by debris and must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<li>Thorvin Twinbeard (see appendix B), Xanathar&rsquo;s engineer, is building a large contraption in the middle of the room. Floating nearby is an albino gazer (see appendix B).</li>
<li>Tools cover stone tables throughout the room. (There are enough tools here to assemble two sets of mason&rsquo;s tools, one set of smith&rsquo;s tools, and two sets of tinker&rsquo;s tools.)</li>
<li>Other furnishings include a cot and a stack of wooden casks filled with Wyrmwizz Ale (a Skullport brew).</li>

The pulverizer consists mainly of a tall stone bin with grinding gears at the bottom, and a chute where the powdered stone pours out.</p>
<p>The pulverizer is a pet project of Thorvin&rsquo;s that allows him to hang around Xanathar&rsquo;s lair and gather information, which he sells to the Harpers. (Thorvin puts the coin he earns from the faction in a bank, far from the beholder&rsquo;s prying eyes.) If one or more characters approach him and claim to be Harpers, Thorvin is upset that they would risk exposing him as a spy, pointing to the albino gazer. If the characters befriend the gazer and promise to go away, Thorvin truthfully answers as many as three questions. He&rsquo;s never seen Ahmaergo&rsquo;s chambers (areas X11 and X12) but knows the rest of the lair well.</p>
<p>If the characters are looking for a way to mess with Xanathar&rsquo;s operation, Thorvin suggests they coerce Nar&rsquo;l Xibrindas, the beholder&rsquo;s advisor (see <strong>area X18</strong>), into giving them the large supply of <wc-fetch type=item>smokepowder</wc-fetch> that he smuggled into the dungeon. Thorvin also tells them where to plant the <wc-fetch type=item>smokepowder</wc-fetch> to cause the most damage (see &ldquo;Destroy the Lair&rdquo;).</p>

Audience Chamber</h4><p>Xanathar greets visitors and makes speeches to its minions in this 40-foot-high domed chamber. Characters who were seen by the scrying sensors anywhere in the dungeon complex can&rsquo;t surprise the creatures here. The magically lit room contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The circular floor is tiled in black marble and bears a gold mosaic of Xanathar&rsquo;s symbol.</li>
<li>Jutting from the ceiling is a bronze, bell-shaped protuberance. (This fixture is the other end of the sound amplifier described in <strong>area X16</strong>.)</li>
<li>Displayed against the curved walls are a dozen lifelike statues (the remains of humans, drow, dwarves, goblinoids, and kobolds who defied the beholder).</li>
<li>Hidden in the floor is a secret trapdoor.</li>
</ul>
<p>While in this room, Xanathar uses its <wc-fetch type=item>ring of invisibility</wc-fetch> to remain unseen and can use a bonus action to activate or deactivate a psychedelic display of magical lights, each one the size of a human eyeball. The lights fill a 10-foot cube in the middle of the room, and the beholder can throw its voice so that it seems to emanate from the same area. Any character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that the display isn&rsquo;t the source of the voice.</p>
<p>If the beholder is here, it&rsquo;s using the psychedelic light display to deliver an incoherent, self-aggrandizing speech to a group of sycophantic underlings consisting of ten human bandit and two duergar who have never seen Xanathar&rsquo;s true form. These minions clutch tankards of Wyrmwizz Ale (a cheap Skullport brew) and toast Xanathar whenever the beholder commends itself. Xanathar&rsquo;s treacherous drow mage advisor, Nar&rsquo;l Xibrindas (see appendix B), stands in front of the open door to <strong>area X19</strong>, clapping weakly at the speech. Floating next to Nar&rsquo;l is his grell bodyguard. If Xanathar has been warned that the characters are near, it wraps up its speech and grants them an audience; see &ldquo;Facing Xanathar,&rdquo; for more information.</p>
<p>If Xanathar is elsewhere, this room contains only Nar&rsquo;l and the grell. Nar&rsquo;l tries to lure adventurers into a showdown with the beholder. If he is wounded, he flees through the trapdoor in the floor and retreats to <strong>area X35</strong> while the grell covers his escape.</p>
<p>If the party includes members of Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe and Nar&rsquo;l recognizes them as such, he gives them his vial of eyescratch poison so they can blind Xanathar with it. This act of treachery, witnessed by the grell, turns the creature against him.</p>

Xanathar&rsquo;s Sanctum</h4><p>This magically lit room has a flat, 30-foot-high ceiling and contains several features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Luminous violet particles drift through the air like mist. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals that these are Underdark spores.</li>
<li>A 20-foot-diameter fishbowl dominates the room. Filled with water, it also contains a small coral reef, a miniature shipwreck, and a sunken treasure chest.</li>
<li>A smaller fishbowl, 3 feet in diameter, rests on a pedestal next to the larger bowl. A dwarf wearing a skullcap adorned with eyestalks feeds a trout-sized fish that swims in circles in this smaller bowl.</li>
<li>A 10-foot-diameter silver mirror is embedded in the western wall. Letters are engraved into its frame.</li>
<li>The eastern tunnel starts 10 feet above the floor and gently slopes upward to <strong>area X21</strong>. (Xanathar uses this passage as an escape route.)</li>

Stay back, or I&rsquo;ll call the boss!&rdquo; Ott can&rsquo;t telepathically communicate with Xanathar, but he thinks he can.

In fact, there have been many Sylgars over the years, but Ott is skilled at acquiring a replacement before Xanathar realizes its beloved pet has died.</p>
<p>Sylgar&rsquo;s large fishbowl weighs about 6,000 pounds, and the treasure chest at the bottom is real (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). The small fishbowl weighs 60 pounds and is used primarily for feedings. Xanathar uses its telekinesis ray to transfer Sylgar from one fishbowl to another.</p>

A creature that ends its turn in the room must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random form of short-term madness, determined by rolling on the Short-Term Madness table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.

<p>Nihiloor has a key that unlocks the chair&rsquo;s shackles. A character can unlock each shackle with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, and a creature shackled to the chair can slip free of these bonds with a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.</p>
<p>The mind flayer has telepathically interrogated Zaibon and learned about a House Auvryndar plot to conquer Skullport, as well as mounting tensions between the drow houses of Auvryndar and Freth. The mind flayer is getting ready to implant an intellect devourer in Zaibon&rsquo;s skull, then use him to undermine the drow plot and foment war between the drow houses. (Were Zaibon less useful, the mind flayer would have extracted his brain and turned it into an intellect devourer instead.) Zaibon knows nothing of the fate that awaits him.</p>

<p>Qrr&rsquo;zarq comes from a colony of mind flayers in Undermountain that wants to implant Xanathar with an illithid tadpole and, through a magical process called ceremorphosis, turn the beholder into a thrall. Qrr&rsquo;zarq is waiting for an opportunity to implant the tadpole while Xanathar is alone and asleep.

<li>Rusty manacles are bolted to the walls. (Hosts for the intellect devourers are chained in these locations.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The brine is a magical substance that radiates an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell.

<p>Bepis Honeymaker is a honey merchant who was kidnapped from his Trades Ward home a month ago. The Xanathar Guild tried to ransom him back, but seemingly his relatives either couldn&rsquo;t pay or decided not to. (In truth, his rotten in-laws destroyed the ransom notes and told Bepis&rsquo;s wife and children that he ran away with another family.) Ahmaergo has put him to work as a cook but threatens to give him over to the mind flayer Nihiloor every so often.</p>
<p>Bepis is a strongheart halfling commoner, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bepis is lawful good.</li>
<li>He is Small and has 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) hit points.</li>
<li>He has these racial traits: His walking speed is 25 feet. He can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. He has advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch>. He speaks Common and Halfling.</li>

<li>Nine shallow alcoves have murals of beholders painted on their walls. Standing in each alcove is a beholder-shaped copper urn atop a green marble pedestal. The lid of each urn is molded with ten eyestalks. (At the back of the westernmost alcove in the north wall is a secret door.)</li>
<li>The western wall is carved to display a scowling beholder flanked by two hooded wizards. Beneath each wizard&rsquo;s cowl, one glaring eye is visible.</li>

If a character pushes either button, or uses an object or spell to do so, the beholder carving on the wall discharges a green ray that the character can dodge with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. If the ray hits, the character appears to be disintegrated but is actually teleported to <strong>area X34a</strong> or X34b, depending on which button was pushed. Once a button is pushed, it locks in place for 1 hour and can&rsquo;t be pushed again until that time elapses.

<p>The Xanathar Guild recently captured some trolls in Undermountain. The trolls are fitted with eyeless helms and ball-and-chain shackles around their ankles. They are then set loose in different wards of the city during Trolltide. When the characters happen upon such a scene, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children in troll masks run through the fog and drizzle, knocking on doors and stopping adults in the streets. Those who aren&rsquo;t placated with candied apples, sticks of salted meat, and other treats perpetrate all manner of tricks. A grumpy old woman has a rat thrown in her face. A burly dwarf has his pipe pilfered.</p>
<p>A small crowd of onlookers is gathered around a ten-foot-tall wicker effigy of a troll, stamping their feet as two young men struggle to set the likeness ablaze with sputtering torches.</p>
<p>Suddenly a whitehaired man bolts toward the crowd, his face a mask of terror. Behind him lurches a massive, green-skinned giant dragging a ball and chain across the cobbled street. A blind helm covers the troll&rsquo;s eyes, but its mouth is a veritable cavern of sharp teeth. It flails its arms, slashing at the fog around it, and lets out a horrible wail of frustration. The crowd panics at the sight of it and flees into the mist and rain. Meanwhile, two members of the City Watch sneak up behind the blind troll, hoping to strike a mortal blow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The white-haired man is a Waterdavian noble of no real accomplishments named Bromas Sultlue. When he sees the characters, he shouts, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a troll! Do something!&rdquo; If the characters intervene, the two City Watch veteran fight alongside them. These constables act on the same initiative count. On their initiative count each round, there&rsquo;s a noncumulative <wc-roll chance>20|20 percent chance percent</wc-roll> that another veteran arrives and joins the fray.</p>
<p>The troll is <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch> while wearing the eyeless helm, and the ball-and-chain shackles clamped around its ankles reduce its walking speed to 20 feet. In this state, its challenge rating is 4 (1,100 XP). As the characters battle the troll, children in troll masks bravely pelt the creature with candied apples.</p>

Bromas Sultlue congratulates them and spends the next tenday recounting every detail of the battle to friends and family members. The story of the characters' heroism spreads, and they gain many new patrons at their tavern. For the next six tendays, when determining the tavern&rsquo;s profitability, add 20 to rolls on the Running a Business table (see &ldquo;Tavern Keeping Expenses&rdquo;). Thereafter, add 10 to such rolls to represent Waterdeep&rsquo;s lingering fondness for the &ldquo;Trollslayers of Trollskull Alley.&rdquo;</p>
