<p>Gold makes people do strange things, and Lord Neverember&rsquo;s hidden cache of dragons is up for grabs. The <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> knows where the treasure vault is located and how to get inside, and much of this chapter focuses on the characters' hunt for the artifact. The challenges before them depend on the villain (or villains) that you selected to oppose them. Whatever the season, a villain&rsquo;s goals are simple: obtain the stone, find the Vault of Dragons, and claim the treasure within.</p>

The nimblewright delivers the artifact to a location and leaves it there for the main villain or villains to retrieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Xanathar is the villain, the stone is delivered to a mage named Grinda Garloth. She owns an <wc-fetch type=item>apparatus of Kwalish</wc-fetch> and lives in Mistshore, a seedy neighborhood built on a dock in the Dock Ward.</li>
<li>If the Cassalanters are the villains, the stone is left in their family crypt in Waterdeep&rsquo;s cemetery, the City of the Dead. A halfling necromancer gets to it before the Cassalanters or the characters do.</li>
<li>If Jarlaxle is the villain, the stone is delivered to Fenerus Stormcastle, a lamplighter in the Trades Ward. Fenerus has a criminal history and is currently in trouble with the law.</li>
<li>If Manshoon is the villain, the stone is brought to Thrakkus, a dragonborn butcher in the Field Ward who chops up bodies for the Zhentarim.</li>
</ul>

If it occurs to none of the characters, an NPC suggests that the party visit the House of Inspired Hands to see whether the priests of Gond know a way to find it (see &ldquo;Nim&rsquo;s Secret&rdquo;). Thereafter, armed with Nim&rsquo;s nimblewright detector, the characters can sweep the city. But by the time they find the nimblewright, it has already delivered the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to its intended destination.</p>
<h4 id=caught-at-last>
<a href=#caught-at-last class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Caught at Last!</h4><p>When it is finally found, the nimblewright (see appendix B) is wearing a stolen cloak and hiding under a pile of uncollected garbage in an alley. Exactly where and when the characters stumble upon it is up to you. With nowhere to go and no other purpose, it fights until destroyed. Regardless of where and when this event takes place, six members of the City Watch (veteran) arrive as the fight ends. Drawn by the commotion, the Watch couldn&rsquo;t care less about the nimblewright and believes any plausible story the characters tell them. (As a construct, it had no rights to speak of.) The officers are near the end of their shift and eager to move on; they urge the characters to go home and cause no further mischief.</p>

Characters who search the nimblewright&rsquo;s remains find the folded-up map, which depicts one of Waterdeep&rsquo;s wards. Written on the map is an X with a name next to it. This map points the characters to where they need to be, setting off a sequence of encounters (see &ldquo;Encounter Chains&rdquo; below). The main villain determines which ward the map depicts and what name is written on it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Xanathar is the villain, &ldquo;Grinda Garloth&rdquo; is written by the X on a map of the Dock Ward. (The X marks the dock neighborhood of Mistshore, where Grinda lives.)</li>
<li>If the Cassalanters are the villains, the name &ldquo;Cassalanter&rdquo; is written by the X on a map of the City of the Dead. (The X marks the location of the Cassalanter mausoleum.)</li>
<li>If Jarlaxle is the villain, &ldquo;Fenerus Stormcastle&rdquo; is written by the X on a map of the Trades Ward. (Residents of the Trades Ward know Fenerus. He&rsquo;s a lamplighter with an alley dwelling. The X marks the alley.)</li>
<li>If Manshoon is the villain, &ldquo;Thrakkus&rdquo; is written by the X on a map of the Field Ward. (The X marks the location of Thrakkus&rsquo;s butcher shop and residence.)</li>
</ul>

The stone doesn&rsquo;t want to be found too easily, though.</p>
<p>If the characters obtain the stone earlier than expected, it proves uncooperative and tries to separate itself from the party as quickly as possible, refusing to share any knowledge with characters in the meantime. The stone tries to take control of anyone who attunes to it, triggering a conflict (see &ldquo;Sentient Magic Items&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). If the stone fails to take control, it can&rsquo;t try again against that character until the next dawn. If the stone succeeds in taking control of its owner, it orders that character to deliver it to whichever location sets into motion the sequence of encounters discussed in this chapter (see &ldquo;Encounter Chains&rdquo;). Once the stone divests itself of its current owner, it tries to erase all knowledge of itself from that character&rsquo;s mind (see the item&rsquo;s description in appendix A). Any player whose character is forced to forget about the stone carries the burden of roleplaying that memory loss. You can award inspiration to that character as a way to acknowledge the player&rsquo;s good roleplaying.</p>
<p>As chapter 4 unfolds, you decide when it&rsquo;s time for the characters to have a chance of securing the Stone of Golorr. Try to keep it out of their hands for as long as possible to maximize the suspense.</p>
<p>Once the characters have earned the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, it no longer tries to take control of them. A character can attune to it and learn the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The location of the Vault of Dragons (see &ldquo;Vault of Dragons&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The three keys required to unlock the vault&rsquo;s doors (see &ldquo;Vault Keys&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the vault&rsquo;s gold dragon guardian, and the powers of the staff in its possession (see the description of the <wc-fetch type=item>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</wc-fetch> in appendix A)</p>
</li>

They form a chain, and their order is determined by your choice of villain and season. The diagram on the facing page illustrates the order of encounters in each chain. If Xanathar is the villain, for example, the chain begins with encounter 2, &ldquo;Mistshore,&rdquo; and ends with encounter 6, &ldquo;Theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel bound by an encounter chain. Let the characters' decisions and actions drive the story. You can change the order in which encounters happen, remove encounters you don&rsquo;t need, or create new encounters. You can also modify encounters to suit your tastes.</p>
<p>If the characters stray, they might find themselves at a loss for what to do next. You have a couple of easy ways to guide them back on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>A friendly faction that has information about the whereabouts of the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> whereabouts can bring that knowledge to the characters.</li>
<li>A treacherous underling of the villain reveals the location of the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> for a price.</li>

If the characters don&rsquo;t steal the stone in time, the villain sends forces into the vault to defeat Aurinax and recover the gold, which takes another <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> days. Once the gold is recovered, the villain moves forward with a master plan as detailed in the introduction. If the characters are still alive, they could oppose the villain by stealing the gold from the villain&rsquo;s lair.</p>

When she refuses to give up the stone, members of the Xanathar Guild try to take it by force (encounter 2, &ldquo;Mistshore&rdquo;). After the characters defeat these attackers, they learn that Grinda told her rat familiar to hide the stone in her family&rsquo;s crypt in the City of the Dead. From this point on, the characters are followed by a gazer (see appendix B), through whose eyes Xanathar can see. If this gazer is killed, Xanathar doesn&rsquo;t send another one to replace it.</p>
<p>Losser Mirklav, a halfling necromancer, raids the Garloth mausoleum and takes the stone shortly before the characters arrive (encounter 4, &ldquo;Mausoleum&rdquo;). As they emerge from the mausoleum, members of the Xanathar Guild attack them, believing they have the stone. A clue left behind in the mausoleum leads the characters to an old windmill in the Southern Ward and a pair of grave robbers (encounter 10, &ldquo;Converted Windmill&rdquo;). Fearing arrest, the grave robbers point them to a cellar complex under the Trades Ward (encounter 9, &ldquo;Cellar Complex&rdquo;). When the characters arrive, they find Losser surrounded by foes and kenku working for the Xanathar Guild making off with the stone. A chase through the streets on or before Trolltide (encounter 3, &ldquo;Street Chase&rdquo;) ends when the kenku, fearing capture, duck into an old tower (encounter 7, &ldquo;Old Tower&rdquo;). If they are caught and confronted, the kenku hand over the stone.</p>
<p>The Xanathar Guild makes one last attempt to regain the stone (encounter 1, &ldquo;Alley&rdquo;). Any character who becomes attuned to the stone learns that the Vault of Dragons lies beneath a theater in the Castle Ward (encounter 6, &ldquo;Theater&rdquo;).</p>

A left-for-dead survivor reveals that these cultists were betrayed by two of their own. The characters head to an old windmill in the Southern Ward where the cult fanatics practice their diabolical faith (encounter 10, &ldquo;Converted Windmill&rdquo;). Spined devils swoop in, snatch the stone, and flee, setting up a rooftop chase (encounter 5, &ldquo;Rooftop Chase&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The spined devils deliver the stone to a hire-coach parked in an alley (encounter 1, &ldquo;Alley&rdquo;). Inside the coach is Victoro Cassalanter&rsquo;s valet, Willifort Crowelle, a doppelganger in tiefling form. As the hire-coach flees, a street chase ensues (encounter 3, &ldquo;Street Chase&rdquo;). When a crowd cuts off his escape route, Willifort leaps out of the hire-coach and tries to lose himself in the crowd. In the confusion, street urchins snatch the stone. The characters catch up to the children in their cellar hideout (encounter 9, &ldquo;Cellar Complex&rdquo;).</p>
<p>With the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> in their possession, the characters emerge from the cellar complex only to find themselves surrounded by members of the City Watch. They are arrested for one or more crimes and taken to a courthouse in the Dock Ward to face sentencing by a magister (encounter 8, &ldquo;Courthouse&rdquo;). Meanwhile, the doppelganger tries to get the stone back.</p>
<p>Any character who becomes attuned to the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> learns that the Vault of Dragons is hidden under an old tower in the Sea Ward (encounter 7, &ldquo;Old Tower&rdquo;). When they arrive at the tower, they encounter its new owner, who is discussing renovations with various local guild members.</p>

They arrive to find the place ransacked (encounter 1, &ldquo;Alley&rdquo;). The duergar who looted the residence work for the Xanathar Guild, and Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe spies have tracked them to a cellar complex in the Southern Ward. In the guise of Laeral Silverhand, Jarlaxle steers the characters in that direction (encounter 9, &ldquo;Cellar Complex&rdquo;). A search of the cellar complex yields a fake stone, but not the real <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>. With no other leads, the characters can follow up with &ldquo;Laeral&rdquo; at a theater in the Dock Ward (encounter 6, &ldquo;Theater&rdquo;). Jarlaxle makes the characters an offer they can&rsquo;t refuse, setting his agents on them if they dare to do so.</p>
<p>Once he realizes the Xanathar Guild doesn&rsquo;t have the stone, Jarlaxle asks the characters to interrogate Fenerus to find out where he hid it. Jarlaxle has learned that Fenerus is awaiting trial at a courthouse in the Castle Ward (encounter 8, &ldquo;Courthouse&rdquo;). Fenerus wants immunity for all of his past crimes. The characters are in no position to grant his wish, but they might threaten him, persuade him, or use magic to charm him. If he is compelled to reveal the stone&rsquo;s location, Fenerus points the characters to an old tower in the Dock Ward (encounter 7, &ldquo;Old Tower&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Jarlaxle&rsquo;s lieutenants reach the stone first and flee across the rooftops in the Dock Ward to escape the characters (encounter 5, &ldquo;Rooftop Chase&rdquo;). They go to ground in Mistshore (encounter 2, &ldquo;Mistshore&rdquo;). Once the characters wrest the stone away from these drow, they can use it to guide them to the home of a famous painter in the Sea Ward (encounter 10, &ldquo;Converted Windmill&rdquo;), beneath which is a tunnel that leads to the Vault of Dragons.</p>

Thrakkus hides the stone in one of his meat deliveries. The characters follow the delivery cart to an alley in the Trades Ward where Zhents meet in secret (encounter 1, &ldquo;Alley&rdquo;). Before the characters can lay hands on the stone, a Zhent named Vevette Blackwater grabs it and flees, initiating a chase across icy rooftops (encounter 5, &ldquo;Rooftop Chase&rdquo;). She hands off the stone to Agorn Fuoco, a bard who is attending a play in a nearby theater (encounter 6, &ldquo;Theater&rdquo;), before leading her pursuers on a merry chase through the snow-covered streets (encounter 3, &ldquo;Street Chase&rdquo;). The characters learn that the stone has been taken by hire-coach to Mistshore. The characters can catch up to Agorn there (encounter 2, &ldquo;Mistshore&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If he is captured and questioned, Agorn reveals that he made one stop on his way to Mistshore. He dropped off a lady friend, a priest of Bane allied with the Zhentarim, and left the stone with her and her acolytes for safekeeping. The characters can find them in an old tower in the Castle Ward (encounter 7, &ldquo;Old Tower&rdquo;). Before they leave that place, the characters are confronted by Manshoon&rsquo;s simulacrum, which arrives by way of teleportation circle to collect the stone. Once the simulacrum is defeated, the characters can use the stone to learn that the entrance to the Vault of Dragons is hidden below a mausoleum in the City of the Dead (encounter 4, &ldquo;Mausoleum&rdquo;).</p>

A creature that has a passive Perception score of 13 or higher spots a trap before accidentally stepping in it.</p>
<p>Any creature that steps into a trap&rsquo;s square must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) slashing damage as the trap snaps shut around its ankle, and the creature is <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> until the trap is removed.

<p>Lord Cassalanter&rsquo;s doppelganger valet, in the guise of an elderly tiefling named Willifort Crowelle, sits in the passenger cab, which grants half cover. Standing next to the hire-coach is a bearded devil disguised as a cloaked human bodyguard wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and perched on the coach are three <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> imp. Any spined devil that survived the previous encounter are also present, having just delivered the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to Willifort.</p>
<p>When he sees the characters, Willifort orders the imps and the spined devils to attack. The bearded devil stays close to Willifort and engages any character who tries to reach the hire-coach.</p>
<p>The hire-coach has AC 14, 45 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any chance that the characters might obtain the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> as the encounter progresses, Willifort orders the driver to move the hire-coach out of the alley as quickly as possible. If the driver is <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> or killed, the bearded devil climbs into the driver&rsquo;s seat on the back of the coach and steers the vehicle. If the bearded devil is unable to replace the driver, the doppelganger takes the reins. Willifort flees on foot if the hirecoach is destroyed or its horses are unable to move.</p>

Determine their marching order, then read the following text once they reach the alley&rsquo;s midpoint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cart laden with apples comes careening toward you from the opposite direction, rolling downhill. Riding on the cart is a tiefling boy with an eye patch, screaming at the top of his lungs. &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; he shouts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A character in the path of the apple cart must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be struck for 5 (<wc-roll>2d4</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage and knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>. A character can forgo the Dexterity saving throw and try to stop the cart bodily, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the character is struck by the cart and falls <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch> as it continues to roll. After plowing through the party, the cart flips on its side, sending apples tumbling down the alley. The tiefling boy is thrown from the cart but not seriously hurt.</p>
<p>The boy is one of three street urchins who teamed up to steal the apple cart from a nearby street corner. The other two children lost control of the cart at the crest of the alley before they could hop on. They catch up to their friend after the crash, make sure he&rsquo;s all right, and then apologize profusely to anyone who was hurt. The urchins, harmless troublemakers, are detailed in the sidebar &ldquo;<strong>area The Three Urchins</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If they are asked about Fenerus, the children know who he is. They describe him as a big man with graying hair who looks like he has been in many fights, based on &ldquo;the scars he wears on his face.&rdquo; They know nothing more about him, other than that he lives alone.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t frighten them away, the children loiter around the alley, eating apples and picking through garbage piles.</p>

When he was drummed out of the gang after a botched raid, Fenerus &ldquo;retired&rdquo; to Waterdeep and joined the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters.</p>
<p>Until recently, Fenerus supplemented his income by spying for the city of Luskan and providing his contacts with information on the political climate in Waterdeep, as well as juicy bits of news overheard on his nightly rounds through the Trades Ward. He has no clue that his contacts are drow members of Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe, since they wear cloaks and keep to the shadows.</p>
<p>Agents of the Lords' Alliance recently labeled Fenerus as a wanted brigand and notified the Lords of Waterdeep, who sent the City Watch to arrest him. Fenerus had the good sense to hide the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> elsewhere and hopes to use it as leverage to gain his freedom as well as forgiveness for past crimes.</p>
<p>Shortly after Fenerus&rsquo;s arrest, drow agents of Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe showed up to collect the stone and were waylaid by <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> duergar hiding in the alley. The duergar were members of the Xanathar Guild that had been sent by Nar&rsquo;l Xibrindas (see appendix B) to retrieve the stone. After searching Fenerus&rsquo;s home and finding nothing, they were waiting for Fenerus to return when the drow showed up. The drow barely got away with their lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A tall, graceful woman in an emerald green cloak approaches you, her long, silver hair billowing out from under her hood. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve come looking for Fenerus Stormcastle, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re too late,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It appears Xanathar has gotten to him first. Fenerus had something in his possession that I desire. Perhaps you can help retrieve it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Laeral&rdquo; tells the characters that Fenerus had a sentient magic item in his possession called the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, which knows the location of a large cache of gold that was embezzled from the city by its previous Open Lord. She asks the characters to retrieve the stone, for the good of Waterdeep, and deliver it to her at the Seven Masks Theater in the Dock Ward. &ldquo;Laeral&rdquo; offers no reward other than the gratitude of Waterdeep&rsquo;s Open Lord.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle suspects that Nar&rsquo;l Xibrindas, his spy in the Xanathar Guild, has betrayed him and is now using the resources of Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe to help the beholder retrieve the stone. Jarlaxle also knows that the Xanathar Guild has a refuge fairly close by, in a cellar complex under the Southern Ward. &ldquo;Laeral&rdquo; suggests that the characters search for the stone there. (Jarlaxle doesn&rsquo;t want Nar&rsquo;l to know that he&rsquo;s onto him, which is why he would rather send a small group of adventurers than call upon a Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe attack force.)</p>
<p>Characters who are suspicious of Laeral&rsquo;s intentions can ascertain that she&rsquo;s hiding something with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by Jarlaxle&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If the characters somehow penetrate Jarlaxle&rsquo;s disguise, he smiles and offers them 10,000 gp if they promptly deliver the stone to him at the Seven Masks Theater. He assures them, in all honesty, that he plans to give the gold back to Waterdeep in exchange for some political goodwill.</p>

<p>The characters approach from either end of the alley. Hoofprints and wheel ruts in the snow testify that Justyn Rassk&rsquo;s delivery cart passed through the alley recently after a brief stop outside the meat shop. A character who inspects the tracks and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can tell that the deliverer visited both the shop and the alley residence. Before the characters can investigate further, they are assaulted by members of the Xanathar Guild.</p>

Five bugbear have quietly climbed up through the grate and concealed themselves in the side alley. They pour out and attack the characters, hoping to gain surprise in the blizzard. Characters who have a passive Perception score of 16 or higher aren&rsquo;t surprised.</p>
<p>The bugbears were sent by Xanathar to retrieve a prisoner being held in the Zhent safe house, but they&rsquo;re too bloodthirsty to pass up the chance to murder a band of adventurers standing in their way. The wind and snow render the City Watch oblivious to the danger.</p>

Given that fresh meat is in short supply in winter, Sora could hardly turn it down. If the characters see fit to tell her that the meat came from chopped-up humanoids, Sora falls ill. She has no knowledge of Thrakkus&rsquo;s nasty handiwork and promises to bring the matter to the attention of the Guild of Butchers and the local magister. Until then, she won&rsquo;t use any of Thrakkus&rsquo;s meat to make her famous meat pies.</p>
<p>Sora is suspicious of her two neighbors in <strong>area L1</strong>. They come and go at strange hours, sometimes returning from a night&rsquo;s sojourn with blood on their leather armor. If the characters do Sora the courtesy of warning her about the meat, she happily shares her concerns about her naughty neighbors, along with descriptions of them. One is a pale, gaunt woman in her twenties with dark, stringy hair. The other is a much older, darkskinned man with a bald head, a half-missing ear, and a short white beard.</p>

Their names are Avareen Windrivver (LE female Illuskan human spy) and Zorbog Jyarkoth (NE male Turami human thug).</p>
<p>When the characters first enter the alley, Avareen is in the front doorway of the house, handing the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to a high-ranking Zhent named Vevette Blackwater (CE female Tethyrian human swashbuckler; see appendix B). Zorbog is stoking a fire in the fireplace while quietly observing the transaction. With stone in hand, Vevette scrambles up to the rooftops, leaving Avareen and Zorbog to deal with the survivors of the conflict between the characters and the bugbears.</p>
<p>Gagged and tied to a chair in the back room of the house is a known member of the Xanathar Guild-a shield dwarf who wears a leather skullcap stitched with fake beholder eyestalks. The dwarf, Ott Steeltoes (see appendix B), was captured while buying fish food in a Dock Ward market. After the Zhents interrogated Ott, it became clear to them that Xanathar would want him back. He is being held until a ransom is paid, but Xanathar has learned where he is being kept. Any bugbears that survived the initial attack try to rescue Ott, while Avareen and Zorbog do their best to fight them off. If Ott is set free, he runs back to the waiting eyestalks of his insane beholder master. Characters who follow him are led straight to Xanathar&rsquo;s lair (see chapter 5).</p>

Multiply the total of the check by 10 to determine the gold piece value of any treasure found. Grinda sells the bounty and gives half to the characters.</p>
<p>As the characters search the harbor for treasure, roll any die. If an even number is rolled, an awakened shark named Obliteros attacks them. Grinda has had several close encounters with the shark recently, but fails to mention this to the characters for fear of scaring them off. Obliteros is a giant shark, with these changes:</p>

The characters have no trouble getting directions to her Mistshore residence (<strong>area D2</strong>).</p>
<p>When the characters arrive at her home, Grinda is holed up inside, having barricaded the doors with furniture. Trying to break down the doors are four members of the Xanathar Guild (CE male human bandit) under the command of a dwarf enforcer named Noska Ur&rsquo;gray (see appendix B). A merrow also under Noska&rsquo;s command swims beneath the docks. It surfaces to attack when the characters arrive.</p>
<p>If the characters come to Grinda&rsquo;s defense, Noska orders his thugs to attack them while he takes potshots at the characters with his crossbow. Two rounds later, eight more bandit leap down from the <em>Kraken&rsquo;s Folly</em> (<strong>area D1</strong>) and join the fray. These hooligans were paid 1 gp each to watch Noska&rsquo;s back. The characters can turn them against Noska by offering a larger bribe (at least 5 gp each).</p>
<p>If the characters turn the hooligans against Noska or reduce the dwarf to half his hit points or fewer, Noska flees. Any remaining Xanathar Guild members cover his escape. Grinda emerges from her residence to thank the characters once the fight has concluded.</p>

Her orders were to protect the stone until Noska arrived to claim it, but she changed her mind and decided to keep the stone for herself. She now realizes that decision was a mistake.</p>
<p>Grinda tells the characters that she gave the stone to her rat familiar and told the creature to stash it in her family&rsquo;s mausoleum in the City of the Dead. The mage gives the characters directions to the site and a key to the mausoleum. (They won&rsquo;t need the key, since the mausoleum is open when they arrive.)</p>

The two drow gunslinger (see appendix B) lurk behind the <em>Kraken&rsquo;s Folly</em> (<strong>area D1</strong>) and wait to be rescued. When the characters confront them, Fel&rsquo;rekt and Krebbyg stall for time until their escape vehicle arrives. If either drow falls, the other tosses the stone into the harbor to keep it from falling into enemy hands. A character can recover the sunken stone by using a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell to help pinpoint its location.</p>
<h4 id=big-belchy>

Lantanese gnomes working for Jarlaxle have managed to repair the construct. Two rounds after the characters corner Fel&rsquo;rekt and Krebbyg, Big Belchy surfaces next to the dock on initiative count 5, close enough that the drow can leap onto its barnacle-encrusted back on their next turns.</p>
<p>In the round after it surfaces, the mechanism breathes a cloud of steam onto the docks in a 30-foot cube, then begins to move away at a swimming speed of 20 feet. Any creature in the cloud of steam must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Big Belchy can breathe steam only once. On each of its turns thereafter, it swims a total of 40 feet toward Jarlaxle&rsquo;s flagship, the <em>Eyecatcher</em>, which is anchored in the middle of the harbor 1 mile away.</p>
<p>Big Belchy has AC 18, 75 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it sinks once more to the bottom of Deepwater Harbor. If the drow are still on its back when it goes down, they swim the rest of the way to the <em>Eyecatcher</em> but gain two levels of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> from the cold water and exertion.</p>
<p>If the drow are defeated while on Big Belchy&rsquo;s back, the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> tumbles off the mechanical dragon turtle&rsquo;s shell and drops into Deepwater Harbor. If the water is deep enough, the characters might need to borrow Grinda Garloth&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=item>apparatus of Kwalish</wc-fetch> to recover it.</p>

En route to that destination, the man had his hire-coach make a brief stop in the Castle Ward to drop off his lady friend. She now has the stone-a fact that characters can discover by questioning the man, a bard named Agorn Fuoco.</p>
<p>Agorn made such a good impression on Manshoon that he was elevated quickly through the ranks of the organization, but his life is full of disappointment otherwise. He has not achieved the fame he craved nor earned the wealth he felt he was entitled to. He has adopted the Zhentarim credo that power comes to those who deserve it and has come to see the Black Network as a new family of sorts. Agorn has come to Mistshore to visit a member of his actual family-his mother, who is gravely ill and lives in abject poverty.</p>

Two draft horse stamp their hooves impatiently in the snow. The driver, Rowan Evenwood (LG female Chondathan human commoner), was paid extra to wait for Agorn to return. He left in a hurry, and she doesn&rsquo;t know how long she is expected to wait, but her patience has limits.</p>

The water around the docks is frozen solid, and impoverished commoner clad in tattered garments gather around sputtering campfires for warmth. These folk are suspicious of anyone they don&rsquo;t recognize and far from welcoming, even toward those who show them charity.

They dart in and out of view, hurling snowballs at each other and laughing as the blizzard batters the structures above them (see &ldquo;<strong>area The Three Urchins</strong>").</p>
<p>When the children see the characters for the first time, their interest is piqued. The children fancy themselves adventurers of sorts, and they are quick to idolize and emulate real-life ones. Squiddly even has the audacity to hurl a snowball at one of them (+0 bonus to hit). The children know who Agorn Fuoco is because he used to live and play music in Mistshore. They offer to lead characters to his mother&rsquo;s residence.</p>

Agorn Fuoco (NE male Turami bard; see appendix B) is inside, trying to smother his bedridden mother, Marta (N female Turami human commoner with 1 hit point), with a sack she uses as a pillowcase. With tears born of joy and sadness streaming down his face, Agorn is cutting loose his old family ties and embracing his new family: the Zhentarim. The characters can stop him from committing matricide by pulling him away from his mother before she suffocates.</p>
<p>Agorn was moved to perpetrate this act by the play he saw at the theater and by his lady friend, Amath Sercent, to whom he entrusted the Stone of Golorr. He won&rsquo;t give up her location willingly, though magic can be used to pry the information from his lips. Characters can also speak to the hire-coach driver, Rowan Evenwood, who dropped off Agorn&rsquo;s lady friend before transporting Agorn to Mistshore. Amath lives in an old tower in the Castle Ward called Yellowspire.</p>

The thugs fight to the death while Agorn tries to escape. If he gets away, the characters might encounter him again in chapter 8.</p>
<p>As the Zhents attack and Agorn attempts to flee, the characters hear a child&rsquo;s scream coming from the opposite direction. Through the blowing snow, they can see that one of the urchins, Jenks, has fallen through a thin patch of ice and is in danger of sinking to the bottom of the harbor. His two friends are trying to pull him out of the hole, but he&rsquo;s too heavy. The children are roughly 30 feet away. A character within arm&rsquo;s reach of Jenks can use an action to try to pull the boy from the cold water, doing so with a successful DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check. If no adult comes to Jenks&rsquo;s aid within 1 minute of his falling through the ice, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown as the cold water overcomes him.</p>
<p>If the characters find themselves outmatched by the Zhents, help comes in two forms. Two Harper spy sent by Remallia Haventree (see appendix B) appear on the scene. Their names are Salazar Lorrance (CG male Tethyrian human) and Mavia Oxlander (NG female Chondathan human). If the battle doesn&rsquo;t turn quickly in the party&rsquo;s favor, Grinda Garloth (see <strong>area D2</strong>) appears and uses her magic to aid them.</p>

The chase takes place on crowded streets, in front of agog spectators.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t been tracking the distance between the doppelganger and the characters, assume the characters are 120 feet away from their quarry at the start of the chase if Willifort is traveling by hire-coach, or 60 feet away if the doppelganger is on foot. The hire-coach has an initiative modifier of +0, and Willifort moves with it. A creature in the hire-coach doesn&rsquo;t need to roll on the Urban Chase Complications table on its turn.</p>

(If the chase occurs on Founders' Day, the crowd is part of the holiday celebration.) The doppelganger jumps out of the hire-coach on his next turn and makes his way through the crowd on foot.</p>
<p>Any creature in the crowd has half cover, and any attack that misses the creature because of the cover hits an innocent commoner instead.</p>
<p>If Willifort is <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>, a raven abruptly swoops down, acting next in the initiative count. It snatches the stone and flees with it. This raven is a shapechanged imp that works for Lady Cassalanter.</p>

Once they have the stone, the street urchins quickly lose themselves in the crowd. If Willifort the doppelganger is still around, he tries to slip away, believing he still has the stone. The imp, if present, turns <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and circles above the crowd in a futile attempt to find the stone.</p>
<p>A character can use an action to search the crowded street by making a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a successful check, the character spots an iron grate in the street that wasn&rsquo;t closed properly. Lifting it reveals an iron ladder that descends 10 feet to an underground sewer tunnel. Characters who lower themselves into the tunnel can hear the sounds of splashing water and children&rsquo;s voices in the distance and might decide to follow them. (The children are holding hands in the dark and being guided by Squiddly, who has darkvision.)</p>

She leads them on a merry chase through snowy streets until she is finally caught or until the characters give up the chase. She starts 30 feet away from the characters. If forced to make an ability check or saving throw because of a chase complication, she has advantage on the roll.

Vevette no longer has the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, after parting with it back in the theater. She doesn&rsquo;t willingly divulge who has the stone, though the characters can pry the information from her using a <wc-fetch type=spell>charm person</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>
<p>If the characters return to the theater, Remallia Haventree (see appendix B) waves them over and tells them that she saw two people exit the theater shortly after they did and then depart together in a hire-coach shortly thereafter. One of them is a bard named Agorn Fuoco, the other a woman unknown to Lady Haventree.</p>

<p>At dusk, hundreds of <wc-fetch type=item>driftglobe</wc-fetch> make their way from the inhabited part of the city and congregate in the City of the Dead. They spend the night here, then disperse and return to the waking city at dawn-for a reason no one knows.</p>
<p>Sir Ambrose Everdawn (LG male human Tethyrian knight), an aging servant of Kelemvor (god of the dead), patrols the cemetery from sunset to sunrise, chasing off grave robbers and making sure the dead stay buried.

One of the grave robbers dropped it while looting the crypts.</p>
<p>The characters can take the key to the Metal House of Wonders, the guildhall of the Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths in the Dock Ward, or to any local locksmith. In either place, someone can identify the key as the handiwork of a dwarf locksmith in the Trades Ward named Elaspra Ulmarr. Characters who visit Elaspra&rsquo;s shop can learn from her that she made a key for a client who bought one of her excellent locks. She even installed the lock for him. Elaspra won&rsquo;t easily divulge the name of the client or his place of residence. She has great respect for the Harpers, however; a character who belongs to this faction and produces a Harper pin to prove it can pry the information from her with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A character pretending to be a Harper can fool her with a successful DC 16 Charisma (Deception) check.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the characters must either compel Elaspra to release the information using magic, or they must sneak a peek at her records, which she keeps in an iron safe that can be opened with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. To pick the combination lock on the safe, a character must succeed on three DC 20 Dexterity (Investigation) checks in a row. Each attempt made to pick the lock requires an action.</p>
<p>From Elaspra or her records, the characters learn that she sold the key to a man named Volkarr Kibbens, whose address is an old windmill in the Southern Ward. The key unlocks the door to his apartment, which he shares with another man named Urlaster Ghann.</p>

The leader, Gorath, accosts the characters in Dwarvish, demands the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, and refuses to believe that they don&rsquo;t have it. If the stone isn&rsquo;t turned over to them promptly, the duergar enlarge themselves and attack. Xanathar watches the battle unfold through the eyes of a gazer (see appendix B), which stays out of the fight and tries to remain unseen.</p>
<p>If this encounter occurs at night, there&rsquo;s a <wc-roll chance>50|50 percent chance percent</wc-roll> that Ambrose Everdawn hears the disturbance and investigates, arriving after two duergar fall in battle.

One well-maintained mausoleum has the name CASSALANTER engraved above its entrance. The outer door is locked when the characters arrive in search of the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that it has been opened recently, as evidenced by dirt smears on the door. A character can try to pick the lock using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic also opens the door.</p>
<p>Human footprints crisscross through the dust on the upper level. A search of the underground crypt reveals the bodies of three humans-two males and a female, all dressed in hooded robes.

They were betrayed by two cult fanatics acting on orders from Lord Cassalanter, who not only wants the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> but also, as a security precaution, intends to eliminate cult members who know too much about it. These three cultists were felled by daggers and <wc-fetch type=spell>inflict wounds</wc-fetch> spells.</p>
<p>The survivor is Vaelle Lurval (LE female Tethyrian human cultist), a 30-year-old Waterdavian florist. She was brought into the cult by her boyfriend, Holiver Tornrudder, who lies dead nearby. The other dead cultist is named Kaeth Warloon.</p>
<p>If she is healed, Vaelle regains consciousness. She reveals that the cult fanatics, Arn Xalrondar and Seffia Naelryke, would likely have taken the stone to an old windmill in the Southern Ward, where they hold their own ceremonies worshiping Asmodeus. Vaelle can provide directions, or she can lead characters there if she is healed fully, for the sake of avenging her murdered lover.</p>
<p>Vaelle believes that the cult fanatics acted on their own, not under Lord Cassalanter&rsquo;s orders. She won&rsquo;t reveal the Cassalanters as the leaders of the cult unless magically compelled to do so.</p>

The characters are unlikely to know it, but the Brandath family is an old one. Lord Dagult Neverember married into it for its wealth, and Lady Brandath gave birth to his son, Renaer. It&rsquo;s a dark irony that Neverember entrusted the location of his embezzled gold to his dead wife&rsquo;s family. Renaer Neverember would be horrified but not surprised to learn the truth.</p>
<p>The cemetery is buried in snow, and though some visitors are drawn to its scenic beauty even in winter, the blizzard keeps most of them away. The crumbling mausoleum is sealed tight, and the name BRANDATH is etched above its entrance. Large elm and birch trees grow around the structure, sheltering it as best they can with their leafless boughs.</p>

It awakens when one or more creatures approach the entrance and growls, &ldquo;Only those of Brandath blood are welcome here! Begone!&rdquo; The treant is particularly surly, it being winter and all.</p>
<p>If someone other than a Brandath descendant tries to open the mausoleum, the treant animates two nearby trees and then attacks. The treant and its animated allies are too big to enter the mausoleum.</p>
<p>The characters can kill the treant, try to slip past it, or retreat until they learn more about the Brandath family. A day&rsquo;s research followed by a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the characters know one such person: Renaer Neverember. If they ask Renaer to admit them to the Brandath family mausoleum, he agrees to do so. Because the treant can sense that Renaer has Brandath blood in his veins, it allows him and those he calls his friends to enter unmolested, and says to Renaer in passing, &ldquo;Your mother was a lovely person.&rdquo;</p>

Once the dust is swept aside, a character who searches the stairs notices the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
<p>If the glyph is triggered, it erupts with magical fire in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on it. The fire spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (<wc-roll>5d8</wc-roll>) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

(A gargoyle broke off the corner of a government building and fell on Uld, crushing him.)

The former is a comical glimpse into the travails of a large halfling family engaged in illicit criminal activity. The latter is a tragic play about an evil Mulhorandi prince who is banished to a desert, <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch> by a lamia, and sent back with powerful magic items to conquer his homeland in her name.</p>
<p>In the early hours of the morning, the backstage area is abuzz with halfling actors donning costumes, wigs, and makeup in preparation for the afternoon&rsquo;s show. As that show wraps, the cast and musicians for the evening&rsquo;s tragic fare arrive.

She pays close attention to characters who nose around backstage, then shares any interesting revelations with Remallia Haventree (see appendix B) at the earliest opportunity.

The Pink Flumph was her husband&rsquo;s passion; for Iokaste, it&rsquo;s strictly a means through which she can rub shoulders with the city&rsquo;s elite. She requires the directors to choose plays and hire actors, while she spends her time &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; greeting important guests and promising them the finest entertainment. She treats her actors and staff like half-forgotten children, and she turns away characters who come to the theater seeking the Vault of Dragons unless there&rsquo;s something in it for her. Appealing to her greed backfires, since Iokaste wants all the treasure for herself.</p>

It can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic also does the trick.</p>
<p>Below the trapdoor is a 30-foot-deep shaft containing a wooden ladder. Characters who descend the ladder find themselves at one end of a 20-foot-wide stone passageway that gradually slopes down 100 feet before ending at the entrance to the Vault of Dragons.</p>

The faerie dragon detests Iokaste but remains on the payroll, begrudgingly using its magic to enhance performances for the sake of preserving Algondar&rsquo;s legacy. It prefers to remain <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and unseen otherwise. Iokaste refers to it derisively as &ldquo;the flying serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the characters threaten it or endanger the theater, Wishes uses its magic to confound and neutralize them. As they make their way to the Vault of Dragons, it follows them invisibly. Once it learns about the gold in the vault, the faerie dragon casts <wc-fetch type=spell>mirror image</wc-fetch> on itself, turns visible, and addresses the characters telepathically. It demands a share of the hoard (at least 5,000 gp), threatens to tip off the City Watch if the characters refuse, and makes good on its threat if the characters don&rsquo;t share the wealth. The faerie dragon doesn&rsquo;t have a hoard of its own, since it gives its earnings to unfortunate Waterdavians by invisibly flying around the city at night and leaving coins on doorsteps, window sills, nightstands, and pillows.</p>

Jarlaxle is waiting for them at the Seven Masks Theater in the Dock Ward. The theater caters to a lower-class clientele, and ship captains and sailors are admitted for free. The owner of the theater is a burly and jovial Shou man with a braided goatee named Rongquan Mystere-another of Jarlaxle&rsquo;s many disguises. When Jarlaxle is away, he entrusts his stage managers to look after things.</p>

Characters who slip in through the back see actors and stagehands bustling about and the director arguing with the playwright while the stage manager looks on helplessly. On the stage, actors walk through their scenes and read their lines to a mostly empty theater. Watching the rehearsal from the front row while smoking a pipe is Jarlaxle Baenre (see appendix B), disguised as Rongquan. Hidden in the shadows in various spots are four drow elite warrior ready to fight by Jarlaxle&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The play, <em>Sapphiria&rsquo;s Booty</em>, is a romantic comedy about a blue-haired madam named Sapphiria who runs a thieves' guild out of a festhall. When a charming sea captain arrives with a hold full of booty from a faraway land, Sapphiria decides to steal it. Zaniness ensues when she falls in love with the first mate, who is half her age, while the captain falls in love with her. On one side of the stage is a backdrop resembling the deck of a ship; the other side is decorated to look like a madam&rsquo;s parlor in a brothel, complete with a gaudy chandelier and a fainting couch.</p>
<p>Westra Moltimmur (CG female Illuskan human commoner with Insight +2 and Performance +6), the play&rsquo;s leading lady, is one of Waterdeep&rsquo;s great treasures, and the cast and crew are very protective of her. Now in her seventies and having been married no fewer than seven times, she has a brisk sense of humor and a zest for life. She&rsquo;s also insightful enough to know that &ldquo;Rongquan Mystere&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t what he appears to be. She has seen the dark elves who watch over Rongquan and observed him using subtle hand gestures (Drow Sign Language) to communicate with them.</p>

In the guise of Rongquan, he claims to be a member of the Lords' Alliance who answers directly to Laeral Silverhand. He also seems to know all about the characters' meeting with Laeral (see encounter 1, &ldquo;Alley&rdquo;) and says he can speak on her behalf. He asks about the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> and is disappointed if the characters don&rsquo;t have it. If they offer up the fake stone recovered in encounter 9, &ldquo;Cellar Complex,&rdquo; Rongquan immediately realizes it&rsquo;s a fake.</p>
<p>If the characters aren&rsquo;t sure what to do next, Jarlaxle imparts the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, don&rsquo;t be discouraged. The wind is blowing in our direction! I&rsquo;ve learned that Fenerus Stormcastle was arrested by the City Watch for theft and taken to a courthouse in the Castle Ward to face the judgment of a magister. No doubt he hid the stone before his capture. You must speak to him right away. You&rsquo;ll need to devise some sort of ruse to get close to Fenerus. I urge against violence, or you might find yourself locked up beside him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters ask why Laeral Silverhand doesn&rsquo;t question Fenerus herself or bail him out of jail, Jarlaxle laughs and says it would be politically unwise for the Open Lord to be seen negotiating with a man who has committed heinous crimes against the city.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle could speak to Fenerus himself, but he&rsquo;s not sure if the courthouse is warded against magic. He can&rsquo;t risk the exposure, so he sends the characters instead. If the characters refuse to work for Rongquan, he shrugs his broad shoulders and lets them leave unmolested, figuring they&rsquo;ll try to talk to Fenerus anyway.</p>
<p>If the characters attack him, Jarlaxle smiles, whistles for his drow bodyguards, and has at them. If the characters fall in combat, Jarlaxle and his guards stabilize dying party members before dragging all of them to a snowy alley and leaving them there with their gear. After the drow depart, a cold wind tears through the alley and awakens the <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> characters.</p>

Dressed in a suit, his hair unkempt, he floats in plain sight most of the time, waving his hands about in gestures of greeting and salutation. Locals are accustomed to his spectral form and his stock introduction: &ldquo;Let not this harried visage diminish you, gentlesirs and beautiful ladies, for I am but your friendly host. What fine art have we wrought for you this day? Buy your tickets and behold! You shan&rsquo;t be disappointed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost can engage in light conversation. It is bound to the theater because Malkolm Brizzenbright&rsquo;s soul couldn&rsquo;t bear to leave the place. If the theater were to close down, the ghost would haunt it still, perhaps becoming more deranged over time. Only razing or burning the theater to the ground can force his spirit to depart forever.</p>

In the story, a young woman is brought to a castle by a count, only to fall in love with his younger brother, a man of faith. Her betrayal eats away at the jealous count. He murders his brother on his wedding day and pursues the bride, who hurls herself off the castle battlements in despair. The count is cursed by the gods and transformed into a creature of darkness, damned to live in his castle and feed on blood. A female cellist and two male violinists provide musical accompaniment.</p>
<p>The shivering audience includes thirty commoner. Also present is a Zhentarim spy named Agorn Fuoco (NE male Turami bard; see appendix B) and his companion, Amath Sercent (LE female Mulan priest of Bane). Agorn is swept up in the drama and fighting back tears while Amath pats his arm gently. Vevette takes a seat behind them and surreptitiously passes the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to Agorn. Looking on from the back row is Remallia Haventree (see appendix B), a member of the Harpers who suspects Agorn of being a high-ranking Zhent. She has been watching him for a while now, hoping to identify other Zhentarim leaders in Waterdeep. Although Remallia appears to be alone, the two violinists (LG male Illuskan human spy with Performance +5) are Harpers under her command. Agorn and Amath are unaware that they&rsquo;re under surveillance.</p>

When cornered, the creature mimics the sound of a screaming child-its way of threatening to harm the boy unless the characters leave at once. The kenku doesn&rsquo;t respond to verbal threats or attempts at persuasion, but it can be bribed with coin, gemstones, or shiny baubles. It gives up both the stone and the boy in return for 100 gp worth of treasure.</p>
<p>If the characters and the kenku reach an impasse, Squiddly kicks the kenku in the shin, causing it to release him, and hides under some old furniture. This act initiates combat as the kenku draws its sword.</p>
<p>If he has a clear path to the stairs, Squiddly runs down them and rejoins his friends. The three children flee the tower together, disappearing into a nearby alley.</p>

Not long thereafter, she found the entrance to the Vault of Dragons beneath the tower. Unfortunately for her, she doesn&rsquo;t know what keys are needed to enter it or what lies within. When the characters arrive, Esvele is in <strong>area O2</strong>, meeting with the following three guild representatives (commoner):</p>
<ul>
<li>Sembra Vashir (LN female Calishite human), of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild</li>
<li>Pynt Oomtrowl (CG female rock gnome), of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild</li>
<li>Jarbokken Frostbeard (LG male shield dwarf), of the Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters, and Tile-makers</li>
</ul>
<p>This meeting is a formality. As the new owner, Esvele is required by law to bring the building up to code. She is gathering cost estimates from the guilds involved but has no intention of proceeding with repairs. The arrival of the characters provides her with a welcome distraction.</p>
<p>Characters will have a tough time convincing Esvele that they have come for any reason other than to break into the Vault of Dragons. Esvele is willing to bring them on as business partners, allowing them access to the vault (preferably when there aren&rsquo;t guild representatives around) in exchange for an equal share of whatever treasure it might contain. She and the characters have each other over a barrel. She can&rsquo;t have them arrested for burglary without the authorities discovering the vault and seizing the tower. And they can&rsquo;t afford to deny the noblewoman what she wants, lest she divulge the vault&rsquo;s location to the authorities in exchange for a reward.</p>
<p>Esvele offers to help the characters obtain the keys needed to unlock the Vault of Dragons and insists on accompanying them during their first foray into the vault, claiming all the while that she&rsquo;s capable of looking after herself. However this business with the party unfolds, she tries to conceal her secret identity from the characters for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Esvele doesn&rsquo;t use a key to lock and unlock the door to <strong>area O5</strong>. She uses thieves' tools instead.</p>

Esvele has already disarmed a magic trap on the door, rendering it safe to open. Beyond it lies a dusty staircase that descends 90 feet to a 20-foot-wide corridor. The hall extends another 90 feet to the vault doors. To one side of the vault doors, a natural fissure in the wall once served as a grick&rsquo;s lair, but Esvele killed the grick and left its corpse on the floor.</p>

Consequently, no magic functions inside the tower. This effect was left behind by the tower&rsquo;s previous occupant, a wizard hermit who dabbled in &ldquo;wild magic&rdquo; and could no longer control it.

But it&rsquo;s not there anymore.</p>
<p>Before the characters reach <strong>area O3</strong>, three drow gunslinger (see appendix B) under the effect of <wc-fetch type=item>potion of invisibility</wc-fetch> use their <wc-fetch type=spell>levitate</wc-fetch> spells to scale the outside of the tower and crawl through the arrow slits. While they are inside the tower, their <wc-fetch type=spell>invisibility</wc-fetch> spells are negated by the antimagic field. One of the drow quickly finds the stone and takes it before the characters show up.</p>
<p>Unless they were defeated earlier in the adventure, these drow are Jarlaxle&rsquo;s lieutenants: Fel&rsquo;rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq&rsquo;il&rsquo;yr, and Soluun Xibrindas. Replace any that were killed earlier in the adventure with other drow gunslingers, and roll initiative for each drow. Soluun (or his replacement) can&rsquo;t resist a good fight and attacks the characters, buying time for the other drow to escape. Once they&rsquo;re outside the tower, the fleeing drow become <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> again as they leap onto a nearby rooftop, but the potions wear off at the end of their next turns, enabling characters to chase after them.</p>

She and her acolytes reside in Yellowspire, a Castle Ward tower so named because its bricks have a pale yellow tinge to them. Amath is in the midst of converting the tower into a temple of Bane. A teleportation circle in the basement allows for swift transport to and from Kolat Towers and Manshoon&rsquo;s extradimensional sanctum.</p>
<h4 id=house-of-tyranny>

Inside the structure, they wear fur-lined robes to stay warm. They refer to the tower as the House of Tyranny, and black prints of their right hands, with fingers and thumb held together, cover every interior surface. These handprints mimic the symbol of Bane.</p>
<p>Amath and her followers assemble here for worship but sleep elsewhere. When the characters first arrive, all five have gathered in prayer on the upper floor of the tower (<strong>area O3</strong>). Three black flying snake nest in the rafters and join any battle here. During this ceremony, Amath and her acolytes hold candles and form a circle around a gagged and blindfolded broadsheet publisher named Shan Chien (N male Shou human commoner). The imperious, middle-aged man is shackled to the floor, and Amath carries the key to the shackles. The shackles can be broken by a creature that uses an action to make a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Picking the shackles' lock requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.</p>
<p>The Banites' ritual is designed to break Shan&rsquo;s will, making him subservient to Bane. Amath has been using this ritual to &ldquo;turn&rdquo; broadsheet publishers as part of a larger plot to control the flow of information in the city-a critical element of Manshoon&rsquo;s takeover. Shan was abducted by Amath&rsquo;s acolytes the night before while walking to his home in the Trades Ward. He publishes <em>The Targe</em>, a broadsheet that offers up vitriolic rants on all manner of local topics, including politics.</p>
<p>Amath has the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> in her pocket. She is expecting Manshoon or his simulacrum to arrive and retrieve it shortly.</p>

Despite its precarious appearance, the scaffolding is secure and safe to walk on, enabling creatures to scale the outside of the tower without having to make ability checks.

When they finally obtain it, fate deals them an unkind hand as Manshoon&rsquo;s simulacrum (see &ldquo;Manshoon&rdquo; in appendix B) arrives by way of the teleportation circle in <strong>area O5</strong>. If the characters had the opportunity and the foresight to destroy the circle prior to obtaining the stone, the simulacrum instead must travel to Yellowspire on foot, giving the characters ample time to get away before it arrives as long as they leave within 1 hour after obtaining the stone. The simulacrum tirelessly pursues the stone, and characters who flee would do themselves well not to leave tracks in the snow.</p>

They demand that the characters surrender their weapons and come along quietly. For guidance on how to handle character arrests, see &ldquo;Breaking the Law,&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The characters are charged with disturbing the peace, a minor offense that carries a fine and results in an edict. The charge stems from their conduct in encounter 3, &ldquo;Street Chase.&rdquo; Depending on how they comported themselves in previous encounters, the characters might be charged with additional crimes against the city or its citizens, possibly including brandishing weapons without due cause, robbery, assaulting a citizen, or murder. If they resist arrest, they are charged with hampering justice. See the Code Legal handout in appendix C for the penalties associated with such crimes.</p>

<p>Characters who give up their visible weapons without a fuss aren&rsquo;t searched, but those who give the Watch a hard time are searched for hidden weapons (and stripped of anything that could potentially cause harm). A character can conceal a Tiny object from the Watch with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> is found during a search, the Watch sergeant inspects it, concludes that it&rsquo;s nothing of consequence, and returns it to its owner.</p>

Any items taken from them during their arrest are entrusted to the front desk clerk (<strong>area H1</strong>) pending the trial&rsquo;s outcome. A character can take a short rest while incarcerated and use that time to attune to the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>. After <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> hours, word comes down that the magister is prepared to hear the characters' testimony, whereupon the guards in <strong>area H8</strong> unlock the characters' cells and escort them to the courtroom (<strong>area H5</strong>), where the magister is waiting.</p>

Then, in the guise of Hyustus Staget (see &ldquo;The Watch Arrives&rdquo;), the doppelganger kills the guards in <strong>area H8</strong> with its bare hands and uses their keys to open the characters' cells. &ldquo;Hyustus&rdquo; warns them that the magister is corrupt and suggests they flee the city before they&rsquo;re sentenced to death. &ldquo;Hyustus&rdquo; offers to deliver messages or items of import on their behalf while they make good their escape. The doppelganger is hoping that the characters will entrust the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to it for safekeeping. Failing that, it hopes to wrest the stone from them during the chaos of the jailbreak.</p>
<p>If the characters refuse to play along, the doppelganger cries out in alarm, bringing the full weight of the courthouse garrison (ten guard and two veteran) down upon the characters, whom &ldquo;Hyustus&rdquo; accuses of beating the cell block guards to death. These reinforcements have no reason to believe that Captain Staget isn&rsquo;t who he appears to be, and they side with him in any conflict.</p>
<p>If the doppelganger obtains the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, it promptly delivers it to Victoro Cassalanter. If the characters extricate themselves from the mess they&rsquo;re in, they can retrieve the stone from Cassalanter Villa (see chapter 6).</p>

He&rsquo;s known for his finely-honed sense of poetic justice and for meting out unconventional punishments.</p>
<p>Magister Umbero Zastro has the statistics of a noble, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is lawful neutral.</li>
<li>He is unarmed, unarmored (AC 11), and worth 0 XP.</li>
<li>He has these racial traits: He has advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>, and magic can&rsquo;t put him to sleep. He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. He speaks Common and Elvish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The magister has already heard the testimony of the arresting officers, as well as that of any eyewitnesses. The characters are given an hour to plead their case while he asks questions. A character who tries to deceive Zastro must make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the magister&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. A character who loses this contest is found guilty of hampering justice, locked up for a tenday, and fined 200 gp, on top of any other punishments meted out for crimes committed against the city and its citizenry. Those who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t pay the fine are sentenced to hard labor for a year in Amendsfarm, a City Guard-run labor camp among the farms of Undercliff.</p>
<p>If the characters committed one or more crimes, they are judged guilty and punished accordingly (see the Code Legal handout in appendix C). A character who pleads for leniency and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check receives an alternate punishment for crimes that don&rsquo;t carry punishments of death or exile. This check is made with advantage if the character has renown in a respectable faction, such as Force Grey (the Gray Hands), the Emerald Enclave, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, or the Order of the Gauntlet. Alternate punishments for lesser crimes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character must make beds and clean bedsheets at local orphanages for a tenday, under guard supervision.</li>
<li>The character must report to Morana Huldark, a dwarf member of the Guild of Watermen, and scrape barnacles off the docks for a tenday under her close supervision.</li>
<li>The character must spend the next month delivering 30-pound casks of drinking water to the guards stationed atop the city walls.</li>
<li>For a tenday, the character must stand on a particular street corner every afternoon from highsun to dusk and, like a broadcrier, shout out the crimes of which he or she has been found guilty while accepting the scoldings and verbal lashings of the citizenry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters who are tricked into acting in accordance with the wishes of the doppelganger can be forgiven for crimes committed during the jailbreak, but only if the doppelganger is apprehended or killed. (It reverts to its true form when it dies.) <wc-fetch type=spell>Speak with dead</wc-fetch> spells can be cast on the cell block guards slain by the doppelganger to obtain testimony that clears the characters of the guards' murder.</p>

If they try to speak with him, they are met by the clerk at the front desk, who informs them that they must schedule a meeting with the magister first, because visitors need her written permission to see him. The clerk says the meeting with the magister can happen no sooner than highsun on the following day but can be persuaded to move up the time for a bribe of 10 gp or more.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to speaking with the magister, if the characters have sufficient renown in a politically influential faction-or a talent for deception:</p>
<ul>
<li>A character who has at least 4 renown in the Harpers can convince Mirt (see appendix B) to use his authority as a Lord of Waterdeep to secure Fenerus&rsquo;s release. Mirt has personally lost coin to the Blood Hawk Posse, so helping Fenerus squirm out of jail stings him deeply.</li>
<li>A character who has at least 4 renown in the Lords' Alliance can arrange a meeting with Laeral Silverhand (see appendix B) at Piergeiron&rsquo;s Palace and convince her to give Fenerus what he wants in exchange for information on the stone&rsquo;s whereabouts. The safe return of Neverember&rsquo;s cache of dragons is more important to her than the fate of one brigand.</li>
<li>The characters can purposely get themselves arrested in the Castle Ward. Even a minor crime can result in a brief period of incarceration until the magister has time to render judgment. In the meantime, characters can try to speak to Fenerus.</li>
<li>The characters can try to infiltrate the courthouse using mundane disguises or magic. Impersonating an official or using magic to influence one is a crime (see the Code Legal handout in appendix C), so they must be stealthy or skilled at deception.</li>

</ul>
<p>The courthouse magister is Hester Barch (LG female Turami human acolyte with Insight +4), a petite woman in her seventies. Magister Barch is slow to anger and fond of sharing lengthy educational anecdotes and parables. Unknown to all but her closest aides, the magister has the innate psionic ability to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>detect thoughts</wc-fetch> spell without somatic or material components. After using it once, the magister must finish a short or long rest before she can cast the spell again. Wisdom is her spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12).</p>
<p>The magister is disinclined to agree to any request for a private meeting with Fenerus, on the grounds that he&rsquo;s a shady, unrepentant person and a flight risk. The conditions under which she will permit a meeting are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A character who has at least 3 renown in the Harpers or the Lords' Alliance, or a character who belongs to a Waterdavian noble family, makes a good argument and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</li>
<li>A character who is impersonating a noble or an official makes a good argument and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. If the check fails, Magister Barch sees through the ruse and uses her <wc-fetch type=spell>detect thoughts</wc-fetch> spell to verify that the character is in fact disguised as a noble or an official-a crime that carries a punishment of flogging followed by imprisonment for up to a tenday, plus a fine of up to 500 gp.</li>
<li>A character tells the magister about the hidden cache of dragons and Fenerus&rsquo;s role in finding it.</li>

</ul>
<p>Fenerus Stormcastle (N male Tethyrian bandit captain) is confined to a cell in <strong>area H8</strong>, waiting to stand trial. He is charged with multiple counts of theft (highway banditry) and assaults against Waterdavian citizens. Fenerus knew it was only a matter of time until someone tipped off the City Watch; he suspects that another member of the Blood Hawk Posse gave him up. The timing is unfortunate for him, since he was planning to earn a small fortune by turning over the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to his Luskanite contact. Now, he plans to use the stone to escape imprisonment and wipe his criminal record clean.</p>
<p>If the characters can get close enough to speak with him, Fenerus refuses to divulge the stone&rsquo;s location until he is released and granted immunity for his past crimes. He knows that the presiding magister or a Lord of Waterdeep has the authority to give him what he wants.</p>
<p>The only condition under which Magister Barch will consider acquiescing to Fenerus&rsquo;s demands is if the characters convince her that such a decision is good for Waterdeep. To accomplish that, they either must use magic to beguile her (which is a crime and likely to result in the caster&rsquo;s arrest once the effect wears off), or they must tell her about the Vault of Dragons and the stolen gold. In either case, she insists on trying something before letting him off the hook: after taking a short rest, she has Fenerus brought to her courtroom and questions him about the stone. Surreptitiously, she uses her <wc-fetch type=spell>detect thoughts</wc-fetch> spell to scan his surface thoughts in an attempt to discern the stone&rsquo;s location. Given that the stone is foremost in Fenerus&rsquo;s mind, Magistrate Barch learns where it is hidden, shares the information with the characters, and returns Fenerus to his cell.</p>

<p>The street urchins took the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to <strong>area B7</strong> (which serves as their clubhouse), entering the room through a secret door (<strong>area B3</strong>). The eldest child, Nat, attuned to the stone, but contact with the aboleth so terrified her that she dropped it, screamed, and ran away. The boys were panicked by her reaction and fled as well, leaving the stone in <strong>area B7</strong>. If the characters open the door at <strong>area B4</strong>, they startle the children on the other side, causing them to scream at the top of their lungs.</p>
<p>Communicating through the other children, Nat tells the characters where she dropped the stone and warns them that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;alive.&rdquo; Neither she nor the boys are eager to see it again.</p>

Korgstrod has been unable to attune to it and assumes he&rsquo;s unworthy of it, not that the stone is fake.</p>
<p>Korgstrod plans to deliver the stone to Xanathar in due time and won&rsquo;t willingly part with it before then. He uses a whip to flog his kobold lackeys and keep them in line. The cowardly kobolds flee into the sewers if Korgstrod is attacked and cower in his presence otherwise.</p>

In combat, they wield shovels that deal damage as clubs. Each carries <wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll> gp in a pouch.</p>
<p>Volkarr and Urlaster were recently hired by Losser Mirklav, a halfling necromancer, to help him break into mausoleums in the City of the Dead. They undertook the job because the pay was good, but they have no loyalty to the necromancer. If the characters confront them, Volkarr and Urlaster attack, but they surrender quickly if overwhelmed and share the following information in exchange for their lives and freedom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Losser Mirklav and his two human apprentices, Retchyn and Kreela, live in a cellar complex under the Trades Ward. The way to their lair is through Retchyn&rsquo;s powdered wig shop, which is called Dandymops.</li>
<li>Losser is stealing bones from the City of the Dead to create an army of animated skeletons. (Neither Volkarr nor Urlaster knows why.)</li>
<li>In the Garloth mausoleum, Losser killed a rat and took the small stone it was carrying. The rat vanished when it died, and Losser thinks the stone is magical.</li>

<p>Lord Cassalanter sent Arn and Seffia on a mission to retrieve the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> from his family&rsquo;s mausoleum.

Her meeting with Neverember marked the beginning of a torrid love affair that lasted over a year. One of the many gifts he lavished on her was an estate in the Sea Ward.</p>
<p>Their relationship faltered as Dagult&rsquo;s visits to Neverwinter became more frequent and extended. He made promises to Kalain that he failed to keep, and when she raised the subject of faithful commitment, he treated her poorly, for his true love was Neverwinter. Kalain became enraged after Dagult&rsquo;s rejection and turned to painting monsters that, in her mind, represented him. Her power to harness the Weave clings to the fabric of her works, giving her the ability to bring these monsters to life on command.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Neverember used his influence to ruin Kalain and divorce her from Waterdeep&rsquo;s high society. She was allowed to keep her home, but her works and her reputation were destroyed, slowly and methodically. Kalain&rsquo;s spirit was broken, leading to the onset of madness. Now she locks herself away, content to let time erode the last of her conscience. She always saw Dagult and Waterdeep as one and the same, and now they are both her mortal enemies.</p>

The only person with whom she&rsquo;s civil is Vhaspar Holmdreg (LG male Illuskan human priest), who rents a room in the west wing of the residence and works in the North Ward at the Hospice of St. Laupsenn, a temple of Ilmater, god of suffering. Vhaspar is an old man in his seventies, half blind with cataracts, who brings her food twice a week, firewood three times a week in the winter, and painting supplies every few months. Vhaspar has a key that unlocks the outer doors of Kalain&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p>Displayed in every room except <strong>area W5</strong> is one of Kalain&rsquo;s paintings. To determine the subject of any given painting, roll a <wc-roll>d12</wc-roll> and consult the Painting Subjects table. It&rsquo;s possible for a subject to appear more than once.

<a href=#path-to-the-vault-3 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Path to the Vault</h4><p>A heavy stone trapdoor in the floor of area W4a can be found with a thorough search of the room and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. Pulling open the door reveals a stone staircase that descends 120 feet to a 20-foot-wide corridor, which extends for another 60 feet and ends before the doors to the Vault of Dragons. Kalain and Vhaspar know nothing of the vault or the trapdoor that leads to it.</p>

A member of the Guild of Butchers, Thrakkus has a lucrative side business. Zhents loyal to Manshoon pay Thrakkus to chop up people they kill, and he sells the meat on the sly. As Deadwinter Day approaches, this meat is in high demand. The corpses are brought to him in the dead of night, most often delivered by Sidra Romeir (see chapter 8, <strong>area K2</strong>) in a covered cart pulled by a draft horse.</p>
<h4 id=butchery>
<a href=#butchery class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Butchery</h4><p>A red wooden sign carved to look like a butcher&rsquo;s cleaver hangs above the door of Thrakkus&rsquo;s butchery, which occupies the westernmost room of the west wing. The butchery is ice cold in the winter and reeks of meat and blood. A bloodstained chopping block dominates the room, and shelves of cut meat wrapped in bloody parchment line the walls. The floor is streaked with blood and covered with bits of gore.</p>
<p>Thrakkus padlocks the door at night. Picking the lock requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The door can also be forced open with a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<h4 id=larder>
<a href=#larder class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Larder</h4><p>The chamber next to the butchery has been converted into a larder, the doors to which are padlocked at all hours. The locked doors are otherwise identical to the butchery door (see above). Like the butchery, the larder is frigid in the winter and smells of meat and blood. Six half-frozen humanoid carcasses are stacked under a 10-foot-square canvas tarpaulin near the western wall. Thrakkus hasn&rsquo;t gotten around to cutting them up yet.</p>
<h4 id=squatters>
<a href=#squatters class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Squatters</h4><p>The dragonborn allows squatters to dwell in his home. Those who can perform menial chores are spared and fed scraps of cooked meat; the rest end up on the chopping block. These homeless sods are too <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch> of Thrakkus to speak ill of him, and the City Watch doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about crimes committed in the Field Ward.</p>
<h4 id=thrakkus-the-butcher>
<a href=#thrakkus-the-butcher class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Thrakkus the Butcher</h4><p>The butcher has no time to suffer fools, and the characters are fools for meddling in his business. Thrakkus spends most of the day in the butchery. At dusk, he retires to his apartment, where he stays until dawn or until someone comes knocking with a body to dispose of. Thrakkus carries keys to the butchery, the larder, and his apartment (<strong>area W7</strong>).</p>
<p>Thrakkus is a dragonborn berserker of red dragon ancestry, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is chaotic evil.</li>
<li>He has these racial traits: He can use his action to exhale a 15-foot cone of fire (but can&rsquo;t do this again until he finishes a short or long rest); each creature in the cone must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. He has resistance to fire damage. He speaks Common and Draconic.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=wheres-the-stone-5>
<a href=#wheres-the-stone-5 class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Where&rsquo;s the Stone?</h4><p>Thrakkus hid the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> in a recent meat delivery to an alley in the Trades Ward. Thrakkus doesn&rsquo;t keep records of his illegal transactions, so the characters must interrogate him or one of the commoners that dwell in his residence.</p>
<p>Thrakkus is belligerent and not eager to give up his Zhent friends. A <wc-fetch type=spell>charm person</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic is needed to compel him to talk. His squatters are another matter; they roll over on Thrakkus quickly to save their own skins once the dragonborn butcher no longer becomes a factor in their well-being. Either approach yields the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thrakkus&rsquo;s last shipment of meat was taken to a shop in the Trades Ward called Cuttle&rsquo;s Meat Pies. It&rsquo;s located in an alley.</li>
<li>The meat was delivered by a member of the Guild of Butchers named Justyn Rassk. Thrakkus paid extra coin to see it delivered &ldquo;quickly and quietly.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Rassk has a blood-spattered horse-drawn cart that he uses to make deliveries outside the Field Ward.</li>
</ul>
<p>The characters might know Justyn Rassk from their own dealings with the Guild of Butchers (see &ldquo;Sample Guild Representatives&rdquo;).</p>

</span></p>
<p>At the end of an encounter chain, a character who is attuned to the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> can learn the location of the Vault of Dragons and what three keys are needed to open its doors. The artifact also reveals that an adult gold dragon named Aurinax guards the vault.</p>
<p>The three keys needed to open the vault are chosen by you or determined randomly by rolling on the Vault Keys table. Illusory versions of keys don&rsquo;t open the door.</p>
<p>Every key can be found or procured in Waterdeep. If the characters don&rsquo;t already know the location of a key, they can gather information about it. To do this, a character must spend 1 day and 5 gp researching the location of a key. At the end of this day, the character makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, learning the location of the key on a success. If the check fails by 5 or more, the main villain learns of the search and sends lackeys to attack the characters and, if possible, wrest the Stone of Golorr from them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xanathar sends either five goblin dressed up as children wearing Trolltide masks and a bugbear (<wc-roll chance>70|70 percent chance percent</wc-roll>), or four wererat in human form (<wc-roll chance>30|30 percent chance percent</wc-roll>).</li>
<li>The Cassalanters send two imp in raven form, three human cultist, and either a human cult fanatic (<wc-roll chance>70|70 percent chance percent</wc-roll>), or four spined devil (<wc-roll chance>30|30 percent chance percent</wc-roll>).</li>
<li>Jarlaxle Baenre sends Fel&rsquo;rekt Lafeen and Krebbyg Masq&rsquo;il&rsquo;yr, or two other Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe drow gunslinger (see appendix B), and six drow.</li>
<li>Manshoon sends four Zhent martial arts adept (see appendix B). There&rsquo;s a <wc-roll chance>50|50 percent chance percent</wc-roll> that these Zhents are led by one of Manshoon&rsquo;s lieutenants, either Vevette Blackwater or Agorn Fuoco, if they&rsquo;re still alive (see chapter 8, <strong>area E8</strong>).</li>

<h4 id=adamantine-bar>
<a href=#adamantine-bar class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Adamantine bar</h4><p>The characters can purchase a 10-pound adamantine bar for 1,000 gp. The genasi smiths Embric and Avi (see chapter 2, <strong>area T3</strong>) can acquire one if the characters think to ask them.</p>
<h4 id=animated-construct>
<a href=#animated-construct class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Animated Construct</h4><p>Any creature of the construct type works as this key, provided the creature hasn&rsquo;t been destroyed or rendered inoperable. If the characters have befriended Valetta, the dragonborn priest of Gond (see chapter 3), she happily releases Nim the nimblewright into their custody until they no longer have need of it. An object animated by the <wc-fetch type=spell>animate objects</wc-fetch> spell also qualifies as this key.</p>
<h4 id=beardless-dwarf>
<a href=#beardless-dwarf class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Beardless dwarf</h4><p>Most female dwarves are beardless and thus meet the condition. A male dwarf NPC can be persuaded to shave his beard, either as a consequence of losing a bet or upon receiving some sort of recompense. The characters can also shave a male dwarf they have captured or against whom they have some sort of leverage.</p>
<h4 id=beholder-eyestalk>
<a href=#beholder-eyestalk class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Beholder eyestalk</h4><p>The eyestalk need not come from a true, living beholder. It can be plucked from a stuffed beholder (see &ldquo;Old Xoblob Shop&rdquo;) or obtained from a lesser form of beholderkin, such as a gazer or a spectator. The eyestalk also need not be detached. Xanathar (see appendix B) gladly accompanies characters to the vault if that&rsquo;s the way to guarantee getting its share of the treasure. Regardless of the arrangement it makes with the characters, &ldquo;its share&rdquo; equates to all the treasure. In other words, Xanathar turns on the party once the vault is unlocked, unless a powerful NPC (such as Laeral Silverhand or Vajra Safahr) is present to keep the mad beholder in check.</p>
<h4 id=bronze-dragon-scale>
<a href=#bronze-dragon-scale class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Bronze Dragon Scale</h4><p>Zelifarn, a young bronze dragon, has taken up residence in Deepwater Harbor. Many sailors and dock workers have seen the dragon, and Grinda Garloth (see &ldquo;Encounter 2: Mistshore&rdquo;), owns an apparatus of Kwalish that characters can use to search for the dragon. Characters who go looking for Zelifarn find him lurking inside a shipwreck 120 feet underwater. As the characters approach the wreck, Zelifarn comes out and tries to scare them away. (He&rsquo;s not done searching the wreck for treasure.) He inflicts harm only in self-defense. A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check or an offer of treasure worth at least 1,000 gp convinces the dragon to talk with the characters and part with one of his scales.

The eastern half of the northern bridge and the western half of the southern bridge are unstable. Either bridge collapses if more than 150 pounds of weight is applied to it. A creature standing on a section of bridge when it collapses must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 60 feet to the floor below.</p>
<p>The middle bridge has a 15-foot-wide gap in it. A character can clear this gap with a running jump-but part of the bridge breaks away under the character&rsquo;s feet on landing, forcing the character to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the floor below.</p>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of evocation magic on the statue.</p>
<p>The trapdoor is false and can&rsquo;t be lifted. Anyone who touches the trapdoor or its pull ring must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by rays of magical fire that spring from the statue&rsquo;s eyes, dealing 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) fire damage. The trap doesn&rsquo;t trigger if the target has total cover.</p>

<p>Although deep underground, this vault is lit by streams of sunlight that pour down from the ceiling, catching motes of dust in their luminous pools. Ornate columns support a thirty-foot-high vaulted ceiling, which is adorned with carvings of dwarves basking in the presence of their gods. Deep alcoves line the walls, and piled in one of them is a vast golden trove.</p>
<p>Out of the dusty gloom steps an aged dwarf clutching a staff carved and painted to resemble a pair of entwined dragons-one red, one gold. Despite the dwarf&rsquo;s age, his eyes are steady and bright. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting anyone,&rdquo; he says plainly. &ldquo;As you can see, the place is a mess. Perhaps you should come back later, after I&rsquo;ve tidied up a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dwarf, who calls himself Barok Clanghammer, is really the adult gold dragon Aurinax (see appendix B) in disguise. He guards the gold for Lord Dagult Neverember and holds the <wc-fetch type=item>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</wc-fetch> (see appendix A) in exchange for his services. Dealing with the gold dragon presents an unusual challenge for the characters, and a peaceful resolution is more likely to benefit them than a violent one.</p>
<p>Aurinax is patient, wise, merciful, and vigilant. He remains in humanoid form until combat breaks out, since he can&rsquo;t easily carry the <wc-fetch type=item>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</wc-fetch> in dragon form. The dragon attacks only in defense of itself, the staff, or the gold. The only individuals authorized to remove the gold under Aurinax&rsquo;s watch are Dagult Neverember and his appointed vassals, none of whom are currently in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>The characters can try to convince Aurinax that they have come on Neverember&rsquo;s behalf. Since he has never met them before or heard Neverember mention them by name, Aurinax is doubtful of their story. Fooling the dragon requires each character within his line of sight to succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the dragon&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If even one character loses the contest, Aurinax senses that the group is lying to him. These checks are made with advantage if Renaer Neverember is with the party, since the dragon remembers meeting Renaer when he was but a child and can easily imagine a scenario in which Dagult Neverember might use his son as his vassal. (The dragon knows nothing of the animosity between Renaer and his father.)</p>
<p>The characters can try to convince the noble dragon that Lord Neverember embezzled the gold from the people of Waterdeep, and that it would be fair and just to see the coin safely returned to its rightful owners. Deep down, Aurinax knows where the gold came from, but the dragon has allowed his greed and his agreement with Lord Neverember to cloud his moral judgment. With a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check, a character can talk the dragon into allowing the gold to be returned to the people to whom it rightfully belongs. The check is made with advantage if the characters brought a prominent city official with them, such as Mirt or Vajra Safahr, or if one of the characters professes to be a worshiper of Bahamut.</p>
<p>Any Charisma (Intimidation) check made to influence Aurinax automatically fails. After the first such attempt, all future Charisma checks made by the party to influence Aurinax have disadvantage.</p>
<p>Aurinax uses Legendary Resistance to avoid being <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>. If a character tries to charm him with a spell and fails, all future Charisma checks made by the party to influence Aurinax have disadvantage.</p>

<p>Aurinax won&rsquo;t give up his gemstones or the <wc-fetch type=item>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</wc-fetch> willingly, since they are his payment for guarding the gold. If need be, however, the dragon is willing to use the staff&rsquo;s power on behalf of the city in exchange for more gemstones.</p>

If the vault doors were left open, the characters encounter these antagonists in <strong>area V2</strong>; otherwise, they&rsquo;re lurking outside the vault, waiting for the characters to emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Xanathar is the main villain, Noska Ur&rsquo;gray (see appendix B) arrives with six bugbear and a gazer (see appendix B). If Noska is dead or otherwise indisposed, the beholder replaces him with Nar&rsquo;l Xibrindas (see appendix B) and his grell bodyguard.</li>
<li>If the Cassalanters are the villains, they send three cult fanatic and three cultist. Victoro&rsquo;s doppelganger manservant, Willifort Crowelle, leads the group in his tiefling guise unless the characters killed him or otherwise disposed of him earlier in this chapter or in chapter 6.</li>
<li>If Jarlaxle Baenre (see appendix B) is the villain, he arrives with three drow gunslinger (see appendix B). Replace no-name drow gunslingers with Fel&rsquo;rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq&rsquo;il&rsquo;yr, and Soluun Xibrindas if they are alive and free.</li>
<li>If Manshoon is the main villain, he sends his simulacrum (see appendix B) along with Agorn Fuoco (NE male Turami human bard; see appendix B), Vevette Blackwater (CE female Tethyrian human swashbuckler; see appendix B), and three Zhent thug. If Agorn and Vevette were killed or otherwise disposed of earlier in this chapter or in chapter 8, replace each of them with one additional thug.</li>
</ul>
<p>The forces sent by Xanathar, the Cassalanters, and Manshoon attack the characters on sight. Jarlaxle, on the other hand, congratulates characters for unlocking the Vault of Dragons and allows them to leave on the condition that they go empty-handed. He intends to see the gold safely returned to the city of Waterdeep but also demands the <wc-fetch type=item>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</wc-fetch> for his trouble.</p>
<p>If Aurinax is alive, the characters can lure enemies to the dragon. Aurinax attacks any creature that attacks him or tries to steal his staff or the gold. He also defends the characters if he has made a deal with them.</p>

<p>Emissaries of the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, and the Order of the Gauntlet come to the characters, asking that the gold be returned to Waterdeep. If the characters refuse to give it up, they are stripped of any memberships they might hold in these factions and quickly find themselves in political hot water. The Lords of Waterdeep charge them with the crime of robbery against the citizens of the city. The characters face up to 1 month of hard labor plus damages equal to the value of the stolen currency plus 500 gp. If they try to flee the city, the City Guard apprehends and imprisons them. If they somehow evade the local authorities, the Harpers and agents of the Lords' Alliance pursue them tirelessly.</p>
<p>Laeral Silverhand is prepared to let the characters keep one-tenth of the treasure (50,000 gp) for themselves. Even that much coin attracts unwanted attention, in the form of several people who beg loans or donations from them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emmek Frewn (see &ldquo;Business Rival: Emmek Frewn&rdquo;) needs 1,500 gp to pay off a loan with interest. If he doesn&rsquo;t repay the coin in a tenday, Istrid Horn (see appendix B) sends Zhentarim thugs to threaten, if not hurt, him. Emmek comes to the characters with hat in hand, preying on their generosity while denying any wrongdoing on his part.</li>
<li>Davil Starsong (see appendix B) asks the characters for a donation of 5,000 gp to keep his branch of the Zhentarim afloat in Waterdeep. Recent altercations and legal issues have drained the Doom Raiders' coffers. If the characters refuse, the Doom Raiders are driven out of the city, yielding control of the Zhentarim in Waterdeep to Manshoon (if he&rsquo;s alive).</li>
<li>Floon Blagmaar (see appendix B) asks the characters to give him 500 gp to cover a hefty gambling debt. If the characters refuse to give Floon the gold, he vanishes without a trace <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> days later.</li>
<li>volothamp &ldquo;volo&rdquo; geddarm (see appendix B) asks the characters for 5,000 gp to fund an expedition that he hopes will inspire a future book, for which he&rsquo;ll give them special mention in said masterwork. If the characters seem hesitant, Volo reminds them that were it not for his starting them off on this adventure, they wouldn&rsquo;t have the gold in the first place.</li>
<li>Jelenn Urmbrusk, a Masked Lord in debt to Manshoon, requests an interest-free loan of 10,000 gp, which she vows to repay within a year. In exchange, she promises to use her &ldquo;considerable influence with the Lords of Waterdeep&rdquo; to help them in the future. If the characters oblige, she makes good on her promise to pay them back and grants them a special favor (see &ldquo;Marks of Prestige&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). If they refuse, they will have made an enemy of the secret Masked Lord.</li>
<li>Temples, charities, guilds, and down-on-their-luck strangers come knocking from time to time. What they ask for isn&rsquo;t much-a few gold here and there-but it all adds up.</li>

In the weeks that follow, word of their deeds spreads to every corner of Waterdeep. Finally, a note is delivered to them that reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Undermountain beckons. See you at the Yawning Portal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters want to explore Undermountain, you can continue this campaign up through 20th level with the book <em>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</em>.</p>
