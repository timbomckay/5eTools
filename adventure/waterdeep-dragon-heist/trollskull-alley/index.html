<p>Trollskull Alley is filled with people who can shape the characters' day-to-day lives in Waterdeep. The characters will likely return to Trollskull Alley many times during the adventure and get to know their neighbors as time passes.</p>
<p>The locations described below are keyed to the map of Trollskull Alley. Buildings not specifically identified on the map are row-houses that serve as private residences for upper-middle class Waterdavians who can afford housekeepers, groundskeepers, and nannies.</p>

<p>Four stories tall and boasting balconies, a turret, and five chimneys, the abandoned building is one of the grandest in Trollskull Alley. Characters can refurnish, rebuild, rename, and otherwise personalize their new stronghold to their hearts' content.</p>

The tavern&rsquo;s other rooms are all empty, except for cobwebs, dust, and harmless rats.</p>
<h4 id=spirit-on-tap>

Maintaining the tavern was his life&rsquo;s work, and he couldn&rsquo;t abandon the place in death.</p>
<p>The poltergeist understands Common and Elvish, but it can&rsquo;t speak. It invisibly causes mischief at the expense of the new owners by smashing plates, breaking beer barrels, and so forth. If the characters don&rsquo;t take the hint, it writes not-so-subtle warnings (such as &ldquo;Closing time!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Last call!") on dusty floors and grimy windows. To truly claim the tavern as their own, the characters must either appease the poltergeist or destroy it.</p>

Once the business is up and running, Lif can also perform other helpful functions, such as locking doors, sweeping floors, and so forth.</p>

If attacked, it flees to the uppermost level of the turret when reduced to half its hit points. From there it fights to the bitter end.</p>

The front room contains displays of ornate wooden furniture, as well as a selection of bows and crossbows. The wall behind the counter is lined with rows of finely carved wooden canes, <wc-fetch type=item>quarterstaff</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=item>shield</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>Talisolvanar &ldquo;Tally&rdquo; Fellbranch, the owner and chief artisan of the Bent Nail, is a male half-elf carpenter and woodcarver. He is a commoner, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tally is chaotic good.</li>

Steam and Steel</h3><p>During daylight hours, smoke and steam billow from the many windows around this indoor forge where metal weapons, armor, and tools are made. The forge is owned and operated by a married couple: a fire genasi named Embric and a water genasi named Avi. Both are members of the Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths and Metalforgers. As an armorer, Avi also belongs to the Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths.</p>

Tiger&rsquo;s Eye</h3><p>This private detective&rsquo;s business is unremarkable on the outside, its only distinguishing mark an orange-and-black sign featuring a cat&rsquo;s eyes. Inside is a regal apartment dimly lit by flickering oil lamps. The door is locked, and visitors must knock or ring the bell before being let in.</p>
<p>They are met by Vincent Trench, a human detective and the owner of the Tiger&rsquo;s Eye. He speaks concisely, dresses in a sharp suit, and smokes a slim pipe. Vincent is in fact a rakshasa named Valantajar that always casts <wc-fetch type=spell>disguise self</wc-fetch> on itself before seeing visitors. The rakshasa has lived in Waterdeep for years, switching identities as often as needed to keep its true nature hidden. It has grown accustomed to living among mortals and, much to its own astonishment, is rather fond of Waterdeep and its citizens.</p>

Use your judgment when pricing its services; 50 gp is sufficient for most investigations, but if the characters want to learn secrets relating to the major antagonists of this adventure, the rakshasa might require a service in payment, such as slaying enemies that are hunting it, posting advertisements for its business in their tavern, or keeping tabs on someone Vincent has been hired to spy on.</p>

Book Wyrm&rsquo;s Treasure</h3><p>The front of this bookstore is adorned with a charming sign of a gold dragon curled around a treasure hoard of books and scrolls. Inside, the shop is decorated with beautiful hardwood, and the earthy scent of old books permeates the air. The library fills two floors of this three-story building, and it somehow seems to contain more shelves than the building should be able to hold.</p>
<p>The shop is managed by a short dragonborn of gold dragon ancestry named Rishaal the Page-Turner the Page-Turner, who lives on the third floor. Rishaal, a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, is a mage, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rishaal is neutral.</li>
<li>He has these racial traits: He can use his action to exhale a 15-foot cone of fire (but can&rsquo;t do this again until he finishes a short or long rest); each creature in the cone must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. He has resistance to fire damage. He speaks Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, and Elvish.</li>

Within days, faction representatives begin to approach the characters and try to recruit them. This book&rsquo;s introduction describes the various factions and what they look for in recruits. The characters need not all join the same faction, and some might not want to join a faction at all.</p>
<p>A character who belongs to a faction is given a mission upon gaining a level, from 2nd through 5th level. Completing the mission increases that member&rsquo;s renown in the faction. Other characters who aren&rsquo;t faction members can assist in the mission&rsquo;s completion. A character who belongs to a faction other than the Lords' Alliance can turn down a mission without consequence.</p>
<p>Each faction has a representative who serves as its primary contact. This NPC delivers mission briefings and dispenses the tangible rewards for completing a mission. An increase in renown quickly follows. The missions and the manner in which they can be completed are described in the tables throughout this section. You can use missions from these tables or replace any of them with ones of your own creation.</p>
<p>If a mission ends in failure, the characters can try again after 24 hours, unless the failure has created circumstances where doing so is impossible.</p>

Fel&rsquo;rekt Lafeen and Krebbyg Masq&rsquo;il&rsquo;yr watch the characters at night, and Soluun Xibrindas watches them during the day (doing his best to stay out of the sunlight). See appendix B for details on these lieutenants.</p>
<p>Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or higher see fleeting glimpses of the drow spies over a period of several days and can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check, ascertain that these spies are paying particular attention to the activities of the drow party members.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the characters try to confront the drow spies, they avoid contact but leave behind a black eye patch as a calling card. The next day, Jarlaxle Baenre (see appendix B) shows up at the party&rsquo;s headquarters, using his <wc-fetch type=item>hat of disguise</wc-fetch> to appear as a haberdasher named J.B. Nevercott. In this guise, he asks to speak privately with drow characters who he thinks might make suitable Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe recruits. Only drow are given serious consideration, but Jarlaxle doesn&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re male or female. As a test, he offers them their first mission.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle is a consummate actor who never lets down his guard. Even if the characters discern his true identity, he never admits to being anything other than what he pretends to be.</p>

One can also convince a noble to surrender it with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check.

(Jarlaxle never passes up a chance to rattle the nobility and sow political unrest.) A character can break into Gaxly&rsquo;s office while it&rsquo;s closed, either during lunch hour or after hours. Getting in and out without being seen requires two successful DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and getting past a locked door requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools (or a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic). <em>Reward</em>: Each Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe character gains 1 renown.</td>

Melannor delivers missions by way of <wc-fetch type=spell>animal messenger</wc-fetch> spells and is partial to using cats and pigeons as couriers.

<p>Melannor Fellbranch is a half-elf druid, with these changes:</p>

Jeryth, the only member of her family who currently resides at Phaulkonmere, manifests as a disembodied female voice that can be heard by anyone in the villa gardens. She offers membership in the enclave and bestows on each new member a <wc-fetch type=reward>charm of restoration</wc-fetch> (see &ldquo;Supernatural Gifts&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Jeryth also offers Phaulkonmere as a safe haven for enclave members and their friends.</p>
<p>In her disembodied state, Jeryth can&rsquo;t be harmed. If the need arises, Jeryth can cast any spell on the druid spell list. She uses her spells in defense of her estate and its beautiful gardens. A member of the Emerald Enclave can petition Jeryth to cast a spell, which she is happy to do if that character&rsquo;s renown in the enclave equals or exceeds the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>

<td>&ldquo;I just received a report that spined devils are terrorizing citizens in Twelvedog Court, in the Field Ward. Come, let us slay them together and find their evil summoner!&rdquo;</td>
<td>The characters must help Savra defeat five spined devil, which have locals pinned down in nearby buildings. Right afterward, Gysheer Omfreys (LE female Tethyrian human cult fanatic) emerges from an alley and attacks Savra. Gysheer is an overzealous member of a devil-worshiping cult led by Victoro Cassalanter (see appendix B). Savra tries to subdue and question her, but only magical compulsion can force her to implicate Victoro. Since devil worship isn&rsquo;t illegal in Waterdeep, Savra has no grounds to stir up trouble with the Cassalanters, and she advises characters not to do so, either. <em>Reward</em>: Each Order of the Gauntlet character gains 2 renown. Every character who took part receives a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of greater healing</wc-fetch>.</td>

</blockquote>
<p>If the characters seek out Davil, Yagra Stonefist (see &ldquo;Familiar Faces&rdquo;), greets them and leads interested parties to a table in the center of the Yawning Portal&rsquo;s taproom, where her boss waits with drink in hand.</p>

Over drinks, he shares the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Davil is a retired adventurer. He and his adventuring companions joined the Zhentarim a few years back. They help people in need. (More specifically, they provide loans, mercenaries, and other services.)</li>
<li>Another Black Network gang has recently infiltrated the city and tried to take over the Xanathar Guild. They failed, setting off a war in the streets. Davil and his colleagues want to end the violence and restore the peace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Davil offers membership in the faction to interested characters, then assigns them their first mission (see the Zhentarim Missions table). Subsequent mission briefings are written on scrolls and delivered by flying snakes.</p>

The characters continue to receive missions, but they come from Tashlyn Yafeera (see appendix B). Characters first become aware of this change when they receive their next mission briefing, since it&rsquo;s written in a different hand.</p>
<p>If the characters want to speak with Tashlyn directly, Yagra can arrange a meeting in the City of the Dead or some other quiet place. By the time the characters see her, Tashlyn has learned the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rumored leader of the renegade Zhent faction is Urstul Floxin, a known Black Network assassin.</li>
<li>A warrant has been issued for Urstul&rsquo;s arrest, but his current whereabouts are unknown. Even magical scrying has failed to reveal his location.</li>
<li>The botched kidnapping of Renaer Neverember won&rsquo;t sit well with Urstul. He might try again. (Tashlyn doesn&rsquo;t actually believe this, but she knows that Renaer has ties to the Harpers and might share information of interest with the characters.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Weeks after his arrest, Davil is released from custody once the Lords of Waterdeep are satisfied that neither he nor his associates are responsible for the recent violence.</p>

Characters who follow Heldar can save him from Soluun Xibrindas, a renegade drow gunslinger (see appendix B). Soluun hides in the shadows, blade drawn, waiting for the half-elf to stumble by. Spotting him before he strikes requires a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check.

Awaiting delivery near the God Catcher is Esvele Rosznar, the Black Viper (see appendix B). She wears a hooded purple cloak and is seated in the back of a hire-coach. She exchanges the coffer for a black velvet pouch, then orders her driver to depart. The coach delivers Esvele to her estate in the Sea Ward. <em>Reward</em>: Each Zhentarim character gains 1 renown.

Dasher shows up to hear what the characters have to say, but he has no intention of going home. He recently joined a gang of halfling wererats called the Shard Shunners (so named because they detest silver) and has since become a wererat himself.

As they approach his shop, they see him ride off in a dray with five other passengers and a driver (all commoner). If Skeemo realizes he&rsquo;s being followed, he casts fly and takes to the air. If the effect is dispelled or the characters maintain pursuit, he casts greater invisibility on himself and uses crowds to cover his escape. If the characters fail to nab him, he takes refuge in Kolat Towers (see chapter 8). <em>Reward</em>: Each Zhentarim character gains 2 renown if Skeemo is eliminated without implicating the Black Network. In addition, characters who snatch Skeemo&rsquo;s satchel find that it holds his spellbook (containing all the spells he has prepared), a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of mind reading</wc-fetch>, and 150 gp in a silk coin purse.</td>

Repairs to the walls and the roof require the approval and oversight of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild. The Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild is best equipped to handle the refurbishing of the basement and plumbing. Clean bedsheets are provided by the Launderers' Guild. The streets around the establishment are kept up by the Dungsweepers' Guild and the Loyal Order of Street Laborers. Meat must come from the Guild of Butchers; ale and wine from the Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild; and bread and pastries from the Bakers' Guild. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Broxley (LG male strongheart halfling commoner) is a laid-back, law-abiding halfling with mutton chops and bushy eyebrows. Inns and taverns are few and far between in the North Ward, so he makes frequent visits to the characters' place to see how it&rsquo;s doing and to offer his well-wishes. If none of the characters are members of the guild, he strongly urges them to join &ldquo;to avoid further harassment.&rdquo; The cost of membership in the Fellowship of Innkeepers is included in the regular expenses outlined in the &ldquo;Tavern Keeping Expenses&rdquo; sidebar.</p>
<p>Broxley has long believed the tavern to be haunted and is glad to see living souls in it once more. While lamenting the burdens of being a father of nine, he is quick to point out that the characters' continued compliance with guild rules and regulations makes his rather difficult life &ldquo;just a bitty bit easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hammond (N male Illuskan human commoner) doesn&rsquo;t like adventurers, but he likes their coin. This effete, well-dressed man is always seen in the company of a young scribe, Jinny (NG female tiefling commoner), who wears spectacles and silently records notes and conversations in a small book as Hammond speaks.</p>
<p>Hammond likes to stop by in the middle of the month to inform the characters of new spirits that the guild has to offer, and to give them a list of which ones to push hard. To test the extent of their willingness to cooperate, he chastises them for their current selection of beverages, even if he previously sold them those goods.</p>

<p>Dead-eyed, slack-jawed Justyn (NE male Illuskan human thug) grew up in the toughest neighborhood in the Field Ward and has the scars to prove it. The guild doesn&rsquo;t pay him enough for him to afford a residence in the North Ward, and going to that part of the city fills his heart with resentment. He darkens the characters' doorstep once a month to deliver a cartload of chopped meat for the tavern&rsquo;s larder. Although delivery fees are covered by the guild&rsquo;s monthly dues, Justyn always demands some extra coin for his service. If the characters don&rsquo;t give him a gratuity of at least 3 gp, he says, &ldquo;Maybe next time the meat will be someone you know.&rdquo; He lets the threat hang in the air, then departs.</p>

<p>Ulkoria (NG female shield dwarf archmage) has defended Waterdeep with her magic more times than she can recall. She&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;the Gargoyle&rdquo; because her face is frozen in a scowl that frightens adults and children alike. No one knows where she lives, but it&rsquo;s believed to be underground, possibly a cellar or dungeon under one of the city&rsquo;s oldest estates. She uses <wc-fetch type=spell>teleport</wc-fetch> spells to enter and leave her home, and she&rsquo;s never seen without her shield guardian close by.</p>
<p>A little-known fact is that Ulkoria once owned the tavern in Trollskull Alley. She sold it to a family of shield dwarves, who fell on hard times and sold it to a woman who made it into an orphanage. &ldquo;Turned out to be a hag who was cooking and eating the children,&rdquo; Ulkoria recalls. The estate passed through several more hands in the years that followed. Ulkoria hopes the new owners make something good of it.</p>
<p>Anytime she passes through the North Ward, Ulkoria stops by the tavern for a drink and to check out the place while her shield guardian waits outside. If she doesn&rsquo;t like what the characters have done with the establishment, she keeps her criticisms to herself. The characters can hire her to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch> on the place, for which she charges 300 gp apiece.</p>

<p>Emmek&rsquo;s family migrated to Waterdeep after its holdings in Neverwinter were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR. The family struggled to make ends meet by tanning leather in the Trades Ward. After Emmek&rsquo;s parents died, his sisters took over the business and bought him out. He never liked the work anyway, and he particularly hated dealing with the League of Skinners and Tanners.</p>
<p>Emmek is on shaky financial footing because he has sunk most of his wealth into this latest endeavor. He&rsquo;s also in trouble with two of the guilds. First, he tried to save coin by fixing the roof himself, in defiance of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild. Then he offended a member of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild by comparing the dwarf&rsquo;s beard to barnacles on a ship.</p>

He tends to spend a lot on big, showy items and cut corners on the little amenities.

He spends 50 gp for the services of the Shard Shunners, a gang of halfling wererats with which he has had nefarious dealings in the past. He pays the halflings to hinder the characters' efforts while he works feverishly to manage his own business.</p>
<p>Four gang members have been assigned to work with Emmek: two males named Shard Shunner and Shard Shunner, and two females named Shard Shunner (Kelso&rsquo;s younger sister) and Shard Shunner. These halflings are wererat, with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each wererat is Small and has 27 (<wc-roll>6d6 + 6</wc-roll>) hit points.</li>
<li>It has these racial traits: It can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. It has advantage on saving throws against being <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch>. It speaks Common and Halfling, and it knows thieves' cant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emmek&rsquo;s strategy for ruining the competition and the consequences for putting it into action are summarized in the table below.</p>

This period of time represents an opportunity for the characters to make friends and gain a reputation (for good or ill) in Trollskull Alley-and in Waterdeep itself-before the events of chapter 3 embroil them in a greater plot.</p>
