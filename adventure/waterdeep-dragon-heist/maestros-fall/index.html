<p>Jarlaxle, the leader of Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe, sees membership in the Lords' Alliance as his path to power beyond Luskan. As the secret lord of a city with an unsavory reputation, he has had a hard time getting a seat at the table with other cities of the North when it comes to trade and defense of the region. Thus, he plans to use the stolen gold to bargain with Laeral Silverhand for inclusion in the alliance, and to oust Neverwinter and its lord Dagult Neverember-Jarlaxle&rsquo;s fiercest political opponent-from the group.</p>

When Jarlaxle learns that the characters are aboard one of his ships, he arranges to meet with them in the guise of Zardoz Zord. If they refuse, Jarlaxle orders his crew to cast the characters overboard-or takes care of the job himself if he must.</p>
<p>If he thinks the adventurers can be trusted, Jarlaxle proposes that they join his search for the Vault of Dragons. He intends to return the gold to Laeral Silverhand, less 5,000 gp for the characters in exchange for their help. He offers another 5,000 gp for their help in recovering the <wc-fetch type=item>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</wc-fetch>. If the characters accept, Jarlaxle upholds his end of the agreement. Once the gold is secure, he gives the characters their cut.</p>
<p>If the characters don&rsquo;t agree to Jarlaxle&rsquo;s terms, or if they assault him, he tries to knock them <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> and leave them without clothes or equipment in a gutter in the Dock Ward. He stores their equipment in <strong>area J16</strong> aboard the <em>Eyecatcher</em>, with the exception of any magic items. Those he stashes in <strong>area U4</strong> aboard the <em>Scarlet Marpenoth</em>, his secret submarine.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Jarlaxle is killed, Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe raises him from the dead within a tenday. Once he&rsquo;s back in action, he tries to recover any gear that was stolen from him.</p>

If a figurehead is destroyed, the drow on that ship remain belowdecks to ensure that they don&rsquo;t draw unwanted attention.</p>

In the case of a sunken ship, such wanton destruction could also involve the City Watch, especially if the act results in people drowning.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Jarlaxle Baenre&rsquo;s seafaring carnival travels up and down the Sword Coast in three ships. The <em>Eyecatcher</em>, Jarlaxle&rsquo;s flagship, is ostentatious. Mounted underneath it is the <em>Scarlet Marpenoth</em>, a submarine of Lantanese design. The second ship, the <em>Heartbreaker</em>, is primarily used to transport performers, strange creatures, and <wc-fetch type=item>wagon</wc-fetch>. The third ship, the <em>Hellraiser</em>, transports musicians and decorative floats. The <em>Heartbreaker</em> and the <em>Hellraiser</em> are presently docked, while the <em>Eyecatcher</em> is anchored in the harbor.</p>
<p>All three ships are crewed by drow who are magically disguised to appear human. Despite their disguises, the drow still have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait.</p>
<h3 id=approaching-the-ships>
<a href=#approaching-the-ships class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Approaching the Ships</h3><p>The <em>Heartbreaker</em> and the <em>Hellraiser</em> are docked across from each other at the same pier in the Dock Ward. The characters need only walk up a ramp from the pier to <strong>area J1</strong> on either ship. The pier is so busy that no one takes notice of the characters until they are on a vessel.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle&rsquo;s flagship is anchored in Deepwater Harbor, a mile away from his other ships. To reach the <em>Eyecatcher</em>, the characters must travel there by using another vessel, by swimming, or by flying. If the characters approach in a vessel known to the crew, such as a rowboat from another of Jarlaxle&rsquo;s ships, the characters arouse no suspicion until they are seen on deck. The crew of the <em>Eyecatcher</em> crew sends word to Jarlaxle immediately if the characters approach in an unknown vessel.</p>
<p>If the characters approach the <em>Eyecatcher</em> in an underwater vehicle, such as Grinda Garloth&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=item>apparatus of Kwalish</wc-fetch> (see chapter 4), the character piloting must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check to keep the vehicle from being spotted by the crew of the <em>Scarlet Marpenoth</em>. If the characters approach by swimming, each of them must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid being spotted by the crew of the <em>Eyecatcher</em>.</p>

<h4 id=ship-captains>
<a href=#ship-captains class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Ship Captains</h4><p>Although Zardoz Zord (Jarlaxle Baenre) commands the fleet, each ship has its own captain: a Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe drow mage disguised as a slender, well-dressed human. These captains know of Jarlaxle&rsquo;s plans. They communicate with each other and with Jarlaxle by way of <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spells, which they prepare instead of <wc-fetch type=spell>fly</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>Velgos Ephezzrin captains the <em>Hellraiser</em> in the guise of a human named Fergus Crabwater. He enjoys wine a little too much, and characters have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with him during a meal.</p>
<p>Tylan Ilueph captains the <em>Heartbreaker</em> as a human named Klarr Besham. He&rsquo;s a humorless taskmaster whose tarantula familiar is always on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Llorath Pharn captains the <em>Eyecatcher</em> as a human named Tarwind Arryhook. He loves games of chance and can&rsquo;t resist a good wager.</p>
<p>A successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check and the mention of Zardoz Zord&rsquo;s name is enough to gain an audience with a ship captain.</p>
<p>If the characters capture one of the captains and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, they learn the following information by asking the right questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Sea Maidens Faire and all its ships are under the command of Captain Zardoz Zord of Luskan.&rdquo; (A ship captain won&rsquo;t divulge Zord&rsquo;s true identity unless magically compelled to do so.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Zord has a cabin aboard the <em>Eyecatcher</em> and spends a lot of time there with Margo Verida and Khafeyta Murzan, two of the Faire&rsquo;s star performers.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;A year ago, the Sea Maidens Faire visited the island nation of Lantan, where Zord acquired a submarine called the <em>Scarlet Marpenoth</em>. The submarine is mounted underneath the <em>Eyecatcher."</em> &ldquo;Zord has operatives searching for an artifact called the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, which leads to a place called the Vault of Dragons.&rdquo; (For security, the captains aren&rsquo;t kept informed as to the mission&rsquo;s progress.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Zord has drow spies in Waterdeep-Fel&rsquo;rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq&rsquo;il&rsquo;yr, and Soluun Xibrindas. All carry Lantanese firearms.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Our disguises are powered by a magical figurehead fixed to the fore of each ship.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

All are loyal members of Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe, and all know that Zardoz Zord is Jarlaxle Baenre in disguise. They know nothing about the <em>Scarlet Marpenoth</em> or Jarlaxle&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>The crew has orders not to fraternize with strangers or guests. Characters who question crew members can learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Zardoz Zord is master of the Sea Maidens Faire. If you want to meet him, talk to a ship captain.&rdquo; (A sailor won&rsquo;t divulge Zord&rsquo;s true identity unless magically compelled to do so.)</li>

(Performers have proficiency in the Performance skill.) They&rsquo;re kept in the dark about most things, but they&rsquo;re not oblivious. With a successful DC 10 Charisma check, a character can cajole or trick a carny into revealing one of the following pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Zardoz Zord uses magic to get from the <em>Eyecatcher</em> to the other boats. I&rsquo;ve never seen him in a rowboat.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The sailors communicate with each other using odd hand signals.&rdquo; (Members of Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe use Drow Sign Language.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;All the sailors have an aversion to sunlight.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Have you noticed the sailors have the slightest hint of an Elvish accent?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;All the crew members are men. Very odd.&rdquo;</li>

With a successful check, the character notices that most crew members speak Common with an Elvish accent and exchange hand signals when they think no one is looking. A drow character recognizes the hand signals as Drow Sign Language.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by the magic of the ships' figureheads (see <strong>area J8</strong>) fail to hold up to physical inspection, meaning that characters who interact with crew members have a chance to notice the illusion. For example, a character who grabs one of the sailors by the ear would quickly realize by touch that the ear is pointed, not rounded as it appears. Additionally, any drow character who boards one of these ships instantly takes on the illusory form of a human of the same gender, height, and weight, because of the magic of the ship&rsquo;s figurehead.</p>

Since the figurehead is unpainted, there&rsquo;s no way to tell that it depicts a drow, but a character who inspects the figurehead closely and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a tiny embossed spider on its forehead.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic reveals an aura of illusion magic around the figurehead-the effect that makes every drow aboard the ship appear as a human. A drow&rsquo;s gender, height, and weight are unchanged; the illusion affects only appearance, not voice or mannerisms. Casting <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> on a disguised drow causes the illusion around it to wink out only for a moment. An <wc-fetch type=spell>antimagic field</wc-fetch> suppresses the figurehead&rsquo;s magic within the field&rsquo;s area. Destroying the figurehead ends the effect throughout the ship. A figurehead has AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>

On other days, it contains the following paraphernalia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various trunks filled with musician, dancer, acrobat, and clown costumes</li>
<li>Casks holding confetti, glitter, and body paint</li>
<li>Bundles of wooden stilts (4 and 8 feet high)</li>
<li>Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© beholders mounted atop 10-foot poles</li>
<li>A float topped by a life-size mechanical unicorn ridden by a mechanical drow ranger waving two scimitars (when a lever under the float is pulled, the unicorn farts a 15-foot cone of confetti, which it can do twice before needing to be refilled)</li>
<li>A float topped with two mechanical goblins that repeatedly punch each other when wound up</li>
<li>A float bearing a mechanical armored knight battling a mechanical pit fiend (when wound up, the knight cleaves with its sword while the devil flaps its wings)</li>
<li>Deflated black, blue, green, red, and white dragon balloons (they float magically when filled with air, and their size is Huge while inflated)</li>
<li>An enormous tarrasque puppet for five puppeteers</li>
<li>Wagon covers decorated with tassels and painted with colorful patterns and creatures</li>
<li>Horse and ox harnesses, all brightly decorated</li>

These arachnids have been trained by Jarlaxle since they were hatchlings, and they can pass themselves off as inanimate float decorations by remaining perfectly still until they attack. They aren&rsquo;t hostile toward drow, whose true nature they sense despite the ship&rsquo;s illusion magic. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher realize that the spiders are a threat before the creatures attack.</p>
<p>All sorts of damaged and unfinished attractions are stored here, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of broken clockwork monsters</li>
<li>Half-completed or broken wagon covers and puppets</li>
<li>A deflated balloon of an oversized flumph that has a small gash in it (a mending cantrip can repair the damage)</li>
<li>An undecorated float, topped with an unpainted mechanical gold dragon made of canvas stretched over a wooden frame</li>
</ul>
<p>Rigged with a glass canister of flammable gas, the mechanical gold dragon is designed to breathe fire when a lever is pulled. Pulling the lever cracks the canister and sets the dragon on fire. If the fire breaks out here and isn&rsquo;t extinguished promptly, it spreads to other parts of the hold after 1 minute. Crew members in other parts of the ship detect smoke 5 minutes later, by which time the hold is a raging inferno. Crew members will focus on saving the submarine (if it&rsquo;s still attached) before abandoning ship.</p>

<p>Beastly odors fill the hold of the <em>Heartbreaker</em>, becoming stronger as the characters get closer to the creature pens (<strong>area J20</strong>). The hold is mostly empty on parade days. On other days, it contains disassembled wagons (axles, wheels, and cages) that are used to pull exotic creatures through crowded streets. Tools needed to assemble and repair the wagons hang from hooks on the walls.</p>

Creature Pens</h4><p><em>Heartbreaker only</em></p>
<p>This section of the hold reeks of animal musk and waste. When they&rsquo;re not being paraded through city streets in cage-wagons, the monstrous attractions of the Sea Maidens Faire growl, chortle, stamp, snort, and roar in closed stalls. Two handlers (commoner with proficiency in Animal Handling) walk from stall to stall, carrying buckets of food and speaking softly to the creatures.</p>
<p>Each pen is effectively a cell equipped with a sliding door that can be double-latched from the outside. A wagon assembled in <strong>area J19</strong> can be backed up to any pen. With the pen door open, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check then coaxes a caged creature into the back of a wagon. This check is made with advantage if food is given to the creature. If this check fails by 5 or more, the creature escapes, panics, and begins attacking indiscriminately as it tries to win its freedom. Any such ruckus alerts the animal handlers or other crew members if they are nearby.</p>
<p>The following creatures are kept in the twelve pens:</p>
<p>| - | - |
| Two ape | Four giant fire beetle |
| One rhinoceros | One hippogriff |
| One tiger | One axe beak |
| One allosaurus | Two death dog |
| Two panther | One giant vulture |
| One owlbear | One polar bear |</p>
<p>The death dogs and the giant vulture are evil, and the giant vulture can understand Common (though it can&rsquo;t speak). They seize any chance to escape and revel in the suffering of other creatures.</p>

<p>The crates hold a variety of lichens, mosses, and fungi that are fed to the herbivorous creatures. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the vegetation as native to the Underdark, and the haunches of animal meat as deep rothÃ©â€”an ox-like creature raised for its meat by drow in the Underdark.</p>

Guest Cabin</h4><p><em>Eyecatcher only</em></p>
<p>This richly appointed cabin is set aside for special guests. It contains a large bed, a wooden chest, a freestanding mirror, and a dresser with a lyre atop it. Empty wine bottles roll back and forth across the floor as the ship moves. The bed holds three giggling figures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jarlaxle Baenre (see appendix B), in the guise of Zardoz Zord (absent if he&rsquo;s marshalling the Day of Wonders parade; see &ldquo;Special Events&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Margo Verida, a female Amnian human bard (see appendix B)</li>
<li>Khafeyta Murzan, a female Mulhorandi human swashbuckler (see appendix B)</li>
</ul>
<p>Margo and Khafeyta both joined the Sea Maidens Faire within the past year-Margo as a lyrist, Khafeyta as an acrobat. Jarlaxle has taken a romantic interest in both women, who are also in love with each other.</p>
<p>Margo and Khafeyta are polite but terse. Both are neutral good. If attacked, they grab their weapons and other belongings and flee through a secret door (see below).</p>
<p>If separated from Jarlaxle and compelled to divulge information about their host, Margo and Khafeyta reveal some or all of the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zardoz Zord is a drow named Jarlaxle in disguise.</li>
<li>Each ship in the Sea Maidens Faire is crewed by drow. The ships' figureheads cast illusions on the drow, making them appear human.</li>
<li>Jarlaxle wants the Lords' Alliance to recognize his city, Luskan, as a new member, and he wants to push Neverwinter out of the alliance.</li>
<li>A year ago, the Sea Maidens Faire visited the island nation of Lantan, where Jarlaxle obtained a Lantanese submarine and several clockwork servants.</li>

<p>The room contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sweet smell of lavender permeates the cabin. (The scent is created by magic and can be dispelled.)</li>
<li>A nimblewright (see appendix B) stands in a small alcove next to a chess table. An empty wine bottle on the table is labeled &ldquo;One-Eyed Jax&rdquo; in Common.</li>

<p>The trapdoor has an <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell cast on it, but rapping on it three times suppresses the spell for 1 minute. Alternatively, the trapdoor can be forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>Below the trapdoor, a metal ladder descends to the bottom of a 10-foot-long, 3-foot-diameter steel tube with a circular metal hatch at the bottom. The hatch is opened by turning its valve wheel, which grants access to <strong>area U1</strong> on the <em>Scarlet Marpenoth</em>. This area is magically pressurized to keep water from entering the ship if the hatch is opened while the submarine isn&rsquo;t docked.</p>

These gnomes are apprentice wizard (see appendix B), with these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The gnomes are neutral good.</li>
<li>They are Small and have 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) hit points each.</li>
<li>They have these racial traits: They have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. Their walking speed is 25 feet. They have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. They speak Common and Gnomish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gnomes know a great deal about submarines and very little about everything else. They are treated well by Jarlaxle, but a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check or a bribe of 100 gp or more can convince a gnome to surrender its master keys, tamper with the engine, or pilot the submarine as the characters direct.</p>

The submarine&rsquo;s structural integrity fails when the vessel drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it floods and sinks. The submarine is worth 15,000 gp intact and requires at least one pilot and one engineer to operate. It has a maximum speed of 2 miles per hour and can hold up to 10 passengers plus 2 tons of cargo.</p>
<p>The submarine has the following general features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interior spaces are unlit. (The drow and the gnomes rely on darkvision to see.)</li>
<li>All furnishings and features are bolted down.</li>
<li>Chambers are 8 feet high, with 6-foot-high passages and doorways connecting them.</li>
<li>Air magically circulates through a complex ventilation system and small metal grills set into the floors.</li>
<li>Doors are made of steel and have AC 19, 27 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A door&rsquo;s lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A door can be forced open by a character who succeeds on a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Jarlaxle and the gnomes aboard the <em>Scarlet Marpenoth</em> have keys to all locked doors. All doors are airtight while closed.</li>

<li>The swarm is made up of Tiny constructs.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>

</ul>
<p>The chest has a secret compartment in the bottom that can be detected and opened with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If Jarlaxle has the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, he keeps it in the secret compartment, along with any magic items he might have claimed from the characters.

Command Center</h5><p>Three rock gnome engineer named Lorella Middenpump, Tervaround Waggletop, and Anverth Leffery are on duty here, along with two drow elite warrior named Karabal L&rsquo;enz and Marro Qaz&rsquo;arrt. The drow guard the control room and keep the gnomes on task.</p>
<p>Lorella sits in the pilot&rsquo;s swivel chair, which is bolted to the floor and can be lowered or raised to accommodate a Small or Medium creature. The chair is situated before a panel of dials, levers, and buttons. Tervaround and Anverth stand by the back wall, monitoring gauges and performing system checks. A copper speaking tube enables them to communicate with Breena Baffle stone in the engine room (<strong>area U2</strong>).</p>
<p>The gnomes can pilot the <em>Scarlet Marpenoth</em> without needing to make a check. Any other creature must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence check to figure out the controls. From the control panel, the pilot can detach the submarine from the <em>Eyecatcher</em>, as well as control its speed, direction, and depth. The pilot can electrify the outer hull for 1 minute, after which the system requires 1 hour to recharge. Any creature that comes into contact with or starts its turn in contact with the outer hull when it&rsquo;s electrified must make a DC 15 Dexterity check, taking 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature wearing metal armor has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>

<p>Zelifarn, a young bronze dragon, recently moved into Deepwater Harbor. He has spent the past several months scouring wrecks at the bottom of the harbor for treasure and stashing precious baubles in a hidden underwater cave. Recently, he noticed a strange craft mounted on the underside of the <em>Eyecatcher</em>. His attempts to treat with the crew have met with no success, but he&rsquo;s curious to know more. Since the characters appear to be headed toward a rendezvous with the <em>Eyecatcher</em>, Zelifarn would like them to find out all they can about the underwater vessel without raising suspicion. The dragon promises to meet them again after they have completed their mission. In exchange for information, he offers to give the party a barnacle-covered chest that he found recently.

<p>The shadowy figures are the three drow gunslinger Fel&rsquo;rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq&rsquo;il&rsquo;yr, and Soluun Xibrindas (see appendix B). If any of these drow are dead or otherwise indisposed, replace them with drow elite warriors.

She remains <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> for the entire meeting.</p>
<p>Harper spies in Luskan recently warned Laeral that Jarlaxle might be in Waterdeep. She reached out to him with a <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spell to arrange this meeting, in the hope of finding out his plans. The characters can follow the drow spies to the rendezvous. If the drow realize they&rsquo;re being followed, they make no effort to shake their pursuers. If they&rsquo;re attacked, they scatter and try to complete their mission before heading back to the <em>Eyecatcher</em>.</p>
<p>If a battle erupts and escape appears impossible, the drow fight to the death. A City Watch patrol consisting of six veteran arrives <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> minutes later to make arrests.</p>

It bears the wax seal of Luskan and is written in Jarlaxle&rsquo;s elegant hand, in Elvish. It reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Her Ageless Majesty, Laeral Silverhand, the Witch-Queen of Stornanter, Lady of the North, She of the Seven Sisters, Chosen of Mystra, and Open Lord of Waterdeep:</p>
<p>Your spies are to be commended! Rest assured, my presence in your fair city is purely recreational-though if fortune smiles upon me, this visit could benefit us both.</p>
<p>Your predecessor left the City of Splendors in a sorry state, but you have done wonders to lift the spirit of the citizenry during your short time in office. I know how politics offends you, so forgive me for taking this opportunity to point out the obvious. We can make both our cities stronger and strike back at he who robbed Waterdavians of their wealth and dignity. I&rsquo;m speaking, of course, of that dirty sack of rats, Dagult Neverember. That&rsquo;s the phrase you used to describe him yesterday to the emissary from Mirabar, is it not? Evidently, my spies are also to be commended!</p>
<p>Why let Neverember get away with his crimes against Luskan and Waterdeep? Can we be allies, if not friends? These are the questions that haunt my dreams, as surely as I haunt yours.</p>
<p>Sincerely, J</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laeral isn&rsquo;t surprised that Jarlaxle lacks the courage to meet her in person. She thanks the drow messengers for delivering the letter, cautions them to mind the City Watch and the City Guard, and heads back to the Palace of Waterdeep. The drow spies return whence they came.</p>
<h4 id=conversation-with-laeral>
<a href=#conversation-with-laeral class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Conversation with Laeral</h4><p>If Laeral becomes aware of the characters, she appears before them and asks what business they have with Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe. If the characters have not met the Open Lord before, she might impress them with her plainspoken manner and lack of pretense. Alone and outside the political maelstrom, she acts more like an adventurer than a city official.</p>
<p>If the characters inquire about the letter, she shows it to them and asks their opinions on Luskan&rsquo;s joining the Lords' Alliance. In her mind, Luskan is a greedy pirate state that can&rsquo;t be trusted under any circumstances. If the characters feel similarly, she trusts them enough to ask for their help in finding and securing Lord Neverember&rsquo;s hidden cache of dragons. In exchange, she promises them a 5,000 gp reward and Waterdeep&rsquo;s gratitude.</p>

In the guise of Zardoz Zord, he pays a visit the day before the holiday to the House of Inspired Hands, Waterdeep&rsquo;s temple of Gond, to coordinate with the acolytes in charge of organizing the parade. He presents a detailed plan that commingles the attractions of the Sea Maidens Faire with the bizarre inventions of the temple-a plan that is well received.</p>
<p>The evening before the Day of Wonders, workers begin assembling the wagons and floats of the Sea Maidens Faire on the pier. Early the following morning, the docks are a hive of activity as performers practice their routines and caged creatures are offloaded one by one. An hour before highsun on this crisp and windy autumn day, the Sea Maidens Faire makes its way to the House of Inspired Hands to meet up with the Gond worshipers and their contraptions. From there, the parade strikes out in earnest, marching through Waterdeep&rsquo;s streets to the cheers of the local folk. Zardoz Zord serves as grand marshal, leading the parade on the back of a rainbow-feathered diatryma summoned using his <wc-fetch type=item>feather of diatryma summoning</wc-fetch> (see appendix A). For Jarlaxle, the parade is a chance to show off and be cheered; he has no ulterior motive for participating in the event.</p>
<h4 id=while-the-boss-is-away>
<a href=#while-the-boss-is-away class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>While the Boss Is Away</h4><p>As the Sea Maidens Faire parades through Waterdeep, the characters can slip aboard one or more of Jarlaxle&rsquo;s ships. If things turn violent aboard a ship, its captain uses a <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spell to contact Jarlaxle. Jarlaxle is supremely confident that his crews can overcome any threat, so he doesn&rsquo;t rush to their defense at the first sign of trouble. Only if the characters do considerable damage will he treat their attack as a setback.</p>
<p>If the characters escape a confrontation on the ships but leave behind witnesses who can identify them, it takes Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe several days to track them down (assuming Jarlaxle hasn&rsquo;t already met them). Although killing the characters would be easy at that point, Jarlaxle would rather put them to work for him. He has them watched but doesn&rsquo;t provoke hostilities until such time as the reward clearly outweighs the risks.</p>
<h3 id=escaped-bear>
<a href=#escaped-bear class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Escaped Bear</h3><p>The Sea Maidens Faire parade ends where it started-at the docks. As the attractions are being loaded back onto their ships, the Faire&rsquo;s polar bear gets loose, fleeing into the Dock Ward before its handlers can corner it. News of the escaped bear spreads quickly, and sightings are frequent. If the characters impressed one of the drow ship captains, he contacts them by way of a <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spell and asks for help. He wants the bear retrieved before the City Guard finds and kills it, offering a reward of either 250 gp or a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of water breathing</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>The characters can track and corner the polar bear with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check. Whether a check succeeds or fails, each attempt represents 1 hour of searching. If the characters find the bear within 4 hours, it can be lured back to the Sea Maidens Faire with food or a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The captain then makes good on the promised reward. If the characters don&rsquo;t find the bear, members of the City Guard get to it first and kill it.</p>
