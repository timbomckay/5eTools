<p>Residents of Trollskull Alley are shaken by a loud whoosh, rattling windows, and the screams of city folk. A <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> spell has just detonated in the street, and the neighborhood is thrown into chaos. As members of the City Guard, the City Watch, and the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors rush to the scene, the characters are afforded a chance to assess the damage and investigate further. This incident sets into motion the main plot and puts the characters on a collision course with those who want to find and claim Lord Neverember&rsquo;s hidden cache of gold.</p>
<p>The fireball goes off early in the morning, at a time when all the characters are in Trollskull Manor. Read aloud the following text to set the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Windows rattle as the roar of an explosion fills Trollskull Alley. Charred bodies and anguished screams fly through the air. A thick cloud of acrid smoke billows outward from the blast, which seems to have occurred right outside your door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let the players tell you what their characters are doing at this moment and how they react to the explosion. Those who want to guess the nature of the explosion can, with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check, conclude that someone just cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> spell outside.</p>

The gnome is important because he was carrying the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> (see appendix A)-the key to finding Lord Neverember&rsquo;s hidden cache of gold. Hounded by agents of the Zhentarim, the Xanathar Guild, and Bregan D&rsquo;aerthe, Dalakhar was unable to escape from Waterdeep with the artifact, so he planned to entrust it to the characters briefly, for surely the folk who rescued Lord Neverember&rsquo;s son could keep it safe where he could not.</p>
<p>By the time the events of this chapter have played out, the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> has changed hands a few times and the characters have learned more about the big picture-though they still have a long chase ahead of them.</p>
<h3 id=zhents-caught-in-the-act>
<a href=#zhents-caught-in-the-act class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Zhents Caught in the Act</h3><p>Three members of the Black Network, including the Zhent assassin Urstul Floxin (see appendix B), were close to nabbing Dalakhar when they were caught in the blast. Of the three, only Urstul survived. Though he was wounded, he was able to pluck the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> from Dalakhar&rsquo;s pocket before fleeing the scene. While other survivors were coming to their senses, Urstul stumbled through the smoke and haze and eventually made his way back to Gralhund Villa a short distance away.</p>
<h3 id=house-gralhund>
<a href=#house-gralhund class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>House Gralhund</h3><p>The heads of the Gralhund noble family, Yalah Gralhund and her husband, Orond Gralhund, are providing coin and shelter to Urstul and his fellow Zhents in exchange for the promise of getting their fair share of the hidden cache of gold. But the Gralhunds aren&rsquo;t willing to put their trust entirely in the Black Network; they sent out their own agent to shadow the Zhents, eliminate Dalakhar, and obtain the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> on their behalf. Yalah gave the would-be assassin a <wc-fetch type=item>necklace of fireballs</wc-fetch> with instructions on how and when to use it. When it seemed as though Dalakhar might give Urstul Floxin the slip, this agent hurled one of the beads from the necklace to stop the gnome in his tracks.</p>
<p>The Gralhunds' assassin is a nimblewright (see appendix B) that escaped from the House of Inspired Hands, the temple of Gond in the Sea Ward, a month ago. The construct hitched a ride on House Gralhund&rsquo;s coach. Yalah Gralhund befriended it, offered it shelter, and used it as a servant until she and her husband found a more sinister use for it.</p>
<p>The incident with the fireball has strained the alliance between the Gralhunds and the Black Network. Urstul Floxin is refusing to hand over the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> until he speaks to his secret master, Manshoon. Meanwhile, the Gralhunds are weighing the risks of betraying and murdering Urstul in their own house. If the characters' investigation goes well, they&rsquo;ll blunder into this den of snakes before the chapter is done.</p>

If the investigation stalls, friendly NPCs might step forward to help in exchange for compensation. One such figure is Vincent Trench, the private detective, who lives in Trollskull Alley (see chapter 2, <strong>area T5</strong>). The characters can also consult with friendly factions such as the Harpers.</p>
<h2 id=the-crime-scene>
<a href=#the-crime-scene class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Crime Scene</h2><p>In the wake of the explosion, people emerge from their houses and shops to survey the devastation. The fireball didn&rsquo;t set any buildings ablaze, but it left eleven people dead:</p>
<ul>
<li>One elderly female human who was out for a walk (no one recognizes her)</li>
<li>Two cloaked male humans (Zhentarim sellswords) clad in leather armor with sheathed longswords</li>
<li>Two female humans and one male half-elf dressed in plain clothes (servants of wealthy North Ward families, killed while running errands)</li>
<li>One male gnome (Dalakhar) wearing a burned cloak and clutching a dagger</li>
<li>Two female halflings who were playing a flute and a fiddle, and two male halflings who were dancing</li>
</ul>
<p>The characters have only a few minutes to search the crime scene before members of the City Guard arrive. After that, they aren&rsquo;t allowed anywhere near the bodies, although <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and similarly hidden characters can search the crime scene further. A search of the bodies accompanied by a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the dead male humans has a black, winged snake (the symbol of the Black Network) tattooed on his right forearm.</li>
<li>The dead gnome has dry waste on his boots and cloak, suggesting he has spent time in the sewers recently. He also has a pouch containing five 100 gp gemstones.</li>
</ul>
<p>A character can try to snatch Dalakhar&rsquo;s pouch without being seen by NPC onlookers, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, the character still acquires the pouch, but someone observes the theft and reports it to City Watch constables once they show up (see &ldquo;The Watch Arrives&rdquo; below). This witness to the theft can be silenced with a bribe of 50 gp or more.</p>

The guards don&rsquo;t allow anyone in or out without permission from a superior officer. Another six guard, including a sergeant with 18 hit points, make their way to the crime scene and watch over the dead bodies until the City Watch arrives. Lingering smoke from the fireball also attracts a Griffon Cavalry rider (see appendix B). As its griffon mount circles the neighborhood, the rider watches the streets and alleys for suspicious figures.</p>

<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/WDH/Watch.jpg alt="Saeth and Barnibus" class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>Twenty minutes after the explosion, a City Watch sergeant named Saeth Cromley (see appendix B) escorts a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors named Barnibus Blastwind (see appendix B) to the crime scene. Barnibus quietly takes charge of the investigation at that point, while Sergeant Cromley directs a force of twenty constables (veteran) to knock on doors and question locals.</p>
<p>Before allowing the corpses to be removed and taken to local temples, Barnibus inspects the scene closely and reaches the following conclusions, which he prefers to keep to himself but might share with other members of the Watchful Order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The gnome was running from armed pursuers, of which there were three. The third person who was chasing the gnome isn&rsquo;t among the dead.</li>
<li>The gnome and his pursuers were moving toward the tavern in Trollskull Alley (which Barnibus will soon come to realize is the characters' property).</li>
<li>Neither the gnome nor his pursuers saw the blast coming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these findings, Barnibus decides to question the tavern&rsquo;s owners and occupants, with Sergeant Cromley by his side as a witness and bodyguard. Specifically, Barnibus wants to find out the gnome&rsquo;s identity and whether he was known to anyone. The characters, having never met Dalakhar, have little information to offer unless they decide to lie.</p>
<p>Neither Barnibus nor Sergeant Cromley is quick to jump to conclusions. They both prefer to have ironclad evidence and testimony from reliable witnesses before making any arrests. Even though the characters are suspects by virtue of their proximity to the crime scene, it hardly seems plausible that they would unleash destructive magic so close to their place of business in broad daylight. Consequently, Barnibus intends not to take up too much of their time.</p>
<p>Barnibus and Sergeant Cromley refuse requests by characters to join the investigation. &ldquo;That would introduce too many new variables into an already confounding equation,&rdquo; replies Barnibus with a frown. &ldquo;Trust in the Watch,&rdquo; Cromley adds dismissively. Characters who seem truthful and honest can press Barnibus for further information by making a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they nudge Barnibus into revealing what he has discovered, as outlined above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Lucky I wasn&rsquo;t injured! Through the smoke, I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of a dead gnome, then start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Bent Nail.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fala saw Urstul Floxin fleeing the scene with the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> in his clutches. He circled around the Bent Nail (see chapter 2, <strong>area T2</strong>) on his way out of Trollskull Alley.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!&rdquo;</p>

He didn&rsquo;t see much beyond that, but he found something important after the blast went off:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. Then I heard a &lsquo;plop&rsquo; and found this in the barrel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martem produces a <wc-fetch type=item>necklace of fireballs</wc-fetch> with two beads remaining and a broken clasp. As it fled across a rooftop, the nimblewright accidentally yanked on the necklace, which came off, fell to the roof, slid off the edge, and plopped into the rain barrel next to Martem.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what to make of this object but was planning to keep it. A character can snatch it from him or convince Martem to relinquish it with a successful DC 8 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.</p>

Clerics from local temples are brought in to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>gentle repose</wc-fetch> spells on the corpses, to preserve them while the investigation is ongoing. Any character who has a renown of 1 or higher in Force Grey (the Gray Hands), the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, or the Zhentarim can petition their faction representative to hire a cleric to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> on one or more of the fatalities.</p>
<p>The characters can hire a cleric themselves by making a donation of at least 25 gp to the cleric&rsquo;s temple for each casting of the spell. They must also provide a list of questions they want answered.</p>
<p>A <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> spell can pry some or all of the following information from Dalakhar&rsquo;s corpse if the right questions are asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dalakhar stole an artifact called the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> from the lair of a beholder known as Xanathar, in a dungeon deep below the city.</li>
<li>Dalakhar worked for the Open Lord of Waterdeep. (Here he refers to Lord Dagult Neverember, whom he believes is the rightful Open Lord, not Laeral Silverhand.)</li>
<li>The <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> is the key to finding a hoard of dragons hidden in the city.</li>
<li>Dalakhar heard about a group of adventurers who rescued Lord Neverember&rsquo;s son from the Zhentarim and thought the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> would be safe in their hands for the time being. He was on his way to deliver it to them, planning to come back and reclaim it after he had eluded his pursuers. Then the fireball went off.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following information can be learned by casting <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with dead</wc-fetch> on one or both of the dead Zhentarim sellswords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their names were Bashekk Ortallis and Wern Malkrave. They worked for Urstul Floxin and resided at Gralhund Villa.</li>
<li>Their job was to help catch a gnome named Dalakhar.</li>
<li>Dalakhar had some kind of artifact in his possession which, according to Urstul Floxin, would make them as rich as kings.</li>

It bears a striking similarity to the automatons that sometimes march in the Day of Wonders parade, as anyone who has lived in Waterdeep during the fall season knows. Because the Day of Wonders parade is sponsored by the local temple of Gond, characters might want to visit the temple and investigate a possible connection.</p>

If the characters visit the temple, they see the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The House of Inspired Hands looks like a cross between a temple and a workshop. The symbol of Gond, a toothed cog with four spokes, is displayed prominently. You see the silhouette of a humanoid shape perching on the rooftop. It extends an arm, releasing a tiny metal sparrow into the sky. The bird does a few loops in the air, then veers right toward you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creature atop the temple is Nim, a nimblewright (see appendix B). Nim was given to the temple as a gift from a visiting Lantanese wizard and has been creating its own inventions on the sly. One of those inventions was the nimblewright that detonated the fireball in Trollskull Alley. Another less-dangerous invention, a mechanical sparrow, is on an accidental collision course with the party.</p>
<p>Have the characters roll initiative. Nim&rsquo;s mechanical bird acts on initiative count 10, has a flying speed of 60 feet, and starts 60 feet away from the characters. It has AC 15, 1 hit point, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. On its turn, it flies toward one party member at random and makes a melee weapon attack (+0 to hit) against that character. On a hit, the bird deals 2 (<wc-roll>1d3</wc-roll>) piercing damage as it slams into the character with surprising force. On a miss, it crashes. Either way, it&rsquo;s destroyed on impact.</p>
<p>After the attack, Nim withdraws into the temple&rsquo;s attic through a secret hatch in the roof and lies low, hoping the characters don&rsquo;t report the incident to the temple&rsquo;s acolytes.</p>

Each one bears a prize-winning invention or a miniature model of some other extraordinary creation. Among the displays are several that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 4-foot-tall working model of a clock tower rings at the top of every hour. It is made of wood, iron, bronze, and glass, with brass bells and delicate hands formed from solid gold.</li>
<li>A wooden flying machine has wings that flap when it becomes airborne.</li>
<li>A miniature model of a mechanical dragon turtle has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, &ldquo;Big Belchy. Sank in Deepwater Harbor on the Day of Wonders in 1363 DR.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A functional &ldquo;waking helmet&rdquo; equipped with small, articulated metal arms and hands that gently slap the wearer if he or she falls asleep.</li>
<li>A miniature model of a red submarine shaped like a manta ray has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, <em>&ldquo;The Scarlet Marpenoth</em>. Lantanese submersible. Launched in 1489 DR.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>Valetta is neutral.</li>
<li>She has these racial traits: She can use her action to exhale a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot line of lightning (but can&rsquo;t do this again until she finishes a short or long rest); each creature in the line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. She has resistance to lightning damage. She speaks Common and Draconic.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters mention the figure they saw on the roof of the temple, Valetta identifies it as Nim, a nimblewright that was gifted to the temple by a Lantanese wizard. If they describe the incident involving the mechanical bird, Valetta sighs and leads them up a spiral staircase to an attic that Nim uses as a lair-only to find the attic&rsquo;s door fitted with a new lock. Valetta doesn&rsquo;t recognize the lock or have a key to open it, but a character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic also opens the door. Valetta won&rsquo;t allow characters to break down the door, but she does permit them to speak to Nim through the door. A character can persuade Nim to unlock the door with a successful DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Valetta grants advantage on the roll by strongly urging Nim to comply.</p>

It has developed a simple sign language that Valetta and other members of the temple staff understand. After the incident with the bird, Nim hides amid the clutter in its lair, but it emerges if the characters find their way inside or coax it into unlocking the door. If the characters ask about the other nimblewright, Nim admits (through gesturing to Valetta) that it built the other nimblewright to ease its loneliness. But then Nim&rsquo;s creation fled in confused terror a month ago, and Nim hasn&rsquo;t seen it since. In light of this revelation, Valetta angrily orders acolytes to remove Nim&rsquo;s tools and unfinished inventions from the attic, while she forces Nim to look on.</p>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of divination magic around it. If asked about it, Nim tells Valetta that it built this device to find the errant nimblewright and tried to seek it out, only to discover that Nim couldn&rsquo;t leave the temple grounds. Once Nim explains how the nimblewright detector works, Valetta allows the characters to take it. To activate the nimblewright detector, a character must hold down its trigger. When the activated device comes within 500 feet of a nimblewright other than Nim, the umbrella begins to spin, whir, and click. The spinning, whirring, and clicking accelerates as the distance to the target lessens, reaching maximum velocity and volume when a nimblewright other than Nim is within 30 feet of the device.</p>

A ward-by-ward search is the best approach, but let the players tell you how their characters conduct the search. Depending on where they go, the search could take days.</p>
<p>A character mounted on a griffon can complete a city-wide search in a couple of hours. To secure the use of a griffon, a character must either be a member of the Order of the Gauntlet on good terms with Savra Belabranta or a member of the Lords' Alliance on good terms with Jalester Silvermane. As it happens, a young griffon named Bonesnapper is being trained to serve as a mount in the Griffon Cavalry. If Savra or Jalester is inclined to help the party, the characters can arrange to meet the griffon and its trainer outside the River Gate the following morning shortly after dawn. (The griffon and its trainer normally reside in Peaktop Aerie atop Mount Waterdeep, but most civilians aren&rsquo;t welcome there.) To gain Bonesnapper&rsquo;s trust, a character must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The griffon won&rsquo;t allow any character who fails the check to ride it.</p>
<p>Nim&rsquo;s errant nimblewright is in Gralhund Villa on Saerdoun Street, in the North Ward. It isn&rsquo;t, however, the only nimblewright to be found outside the House of Inspired Hands.

Two of these galleons, the <em>Heartbreaker</em> and the <em>Hellraiser</em>, are docked. Zord&rsquo;s flagship, the <em>Eyecatcher</em>, is anchored in Deepwater Harbor. Each of the three ships (described in chapter 7) has at least one nimblewright aboard.</p>
<p>The docks are bustling and chaotic during the day, except in winter. At night, darkness provides sufficient cover for characters to approach the docked vessels unseen. If one or more characters are caught aboard a ship, the crew tries to corner them until the ship&rsquo;s captain can have words with them. The nimblewrights, they say, are &ldquo;attractions and nothing more.&rdquo; If the characters ask to speak to the owner of the fleet, a <wc-fetch type=spell>sending</wc-fetch> spell is used to contact Zord, who invites the characters to dine with him aboard the <em>Eyecatcher</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dining cabin is bedecked with golden filigree, the purple curtains festooned with silken tassels, the wood paneling scented with perfume. A magnificent feast laid out on golden platters sprawls atop a mahogany table of exquisite craftsmanship. Even the doilies are something to behold. Standing behind it all with wine glass in hand is a well-built, scantily clad man, his scarlet apparel designed to accentuate his trim figure and bountiful chest hair. A flashy rapier hangs from his stylish belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome aboard the Eyecatcher,&rdquo; he says, flashing his pearly white teeth. &ldquo;Zardoz Zord, at your service.&rdquo;</p>

</span></p>
<p>This dashing figure is none other than Jarlaxle Baenre (see appendix B) magically disguised as Zardoz Zord.</p>
<p>The characters have piqued Jarlaxle&rsquo;s curiosity. He doesn&rsquo;t know much about them (yet) and wants to determine whether they pose a threat (they don&rsquo;t). To win them over, he shares the following information over dinner and wine:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sea Maidens Faire, owned and operated by Zord, is a seafaring carnival based in Luskan that travels along the Sword Coast. It provides good, wholesome entertainment in the form of fantastic street parades.</li>
<li>The <em>Heartbreaker</em> and the <em>Hellraiser</em> are used to transport entertainers, <wc-fetch type=item>wagon</wc-fetch>, and parade floats. The <em>Eyecatcher</em> is Zord&rsquo;s command ship and private yacht. All three ships are built for comfort and speed.</li>
<li>Zord visits the distant island of Lantan about once a year. During his last visit, he purchased four nimblewrights from a Lantanese wizard. He keeps two aboard his flagship, and one aboard each of the other two vessels.</li>
<li>When they&rsquo;re not marching in a parade, Zord&rsquo;s nimblewrights remain aboard his ships. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re perfectly harmless,&rdquo; he attests, whereupon a nimblewright holding a decanter enters the dining cabin and quietly refills everyone&rsquo;s wine glasses.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the characters mention the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, Zord shrugs his shoulders in a manner that suggests he doesn&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about. He also feigns disinterest in Waterdeep politics, saying, &ldquo;Every city has problems, I suppose. My job as an entertainer is to make people forget about politics for a while.&rdquo; Characters who are suspicious of Zord can make a DC 24 Wisdom (Insight) check. Any character who succeeds on the check senses that there&rsquo;s much more to him than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle owns a <wc-fetch type=item>hat of disguise</wc-fetch> but doesn&rsquo;t need it to hide his true form while he&rsquo;s aboard any of his ships. His disguise (and the disguises of his drow subordinates) can be dispelled only by destroying the ship&rsquo;s figurehead (see chapter 7). If the characters somehow discern his true form, Jarlaxle gives the party a slow nod of his head, dryly says &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; and lets them make the next move.</p>
<p>When dinner is concluded, Zord bids the characters farewell and sees that they are escorted safely back to the docks.</p>

Conversely, he could decide to pay them a visit at their tavern. If he&rsquo;s told that a gnome and two Zhents were killed in the blast, Renaer drops a bombshell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When the Lords of Waterdeep ousted my father, I thought his long, dark shadow was finally gone for good. The truth is, I want nothing to do with him. But his spies hound me. One of them, a gnome named Dalakhar, had been watching me for months. Then, about two tendays ago, the spy was suddenly nowhere to be seen. My father didn&rsquo;t trust many people, but he trusted that gnome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke to a few of Dalakhar&rsquo;s friends. Apparently, he was on a special mission to retrieve the Stone of Golorr and was afraid that the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild were close to catching him. When he heard about my kidnapping, he wanted more information about the adventurers who had rescued me. I think Dalakhar was planning to pay you to deliver the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to my father in Neverwinter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any attempt to follow up with Dalakhar&rsquo;s friends proves futile, since they have gone into hiding in the wake of the gnome&rsquo;s sudden demise.</p>
<p>If the characters tell Renaer that Fala Lefaliir saw a man fleeing Trollskull Alley (see &ldquo;Eyewitnesses&rdquo;), Renaer reaches out to his friends in the Harpers. A day later, he returns with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The man Fala saw matches the description of Urstul Floxin, a suspected member of the Black Network.</li>
<li>Another North Ward resident claims he saw Urstul enter Gralhund Villa, in the North Ward, shortly after the fireball incident. The resident reported him to the City Watch because Urstul looked suspicious.</li>
<li>Two City Watch constables spoke to Lord Gralhund. He assured them that no one had broken into the estate and that everything was fine. The constables had no grounds to get a search warrant, so they didn&rsquo;t pursue the matter.</li>
</ul>

Lady Gralhund decides she no longer likes Urstul and, taking advantage of his injuries, wrests the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> from him at swordpoint and orders her guards to lock him up until she decides what to do with him.</p>
<p>Your choice of main villain determines Lady Gralhund&rsquo;s motivation, which is a secret held by her and Hrabbaz, her loyal half-orc bodyguard:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Xanathar is the main villain, Yalah Gralhund has secretly cut a deal with the beholder crime lord, offering to return the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to it if the beholder helps her create a vacancy on the council of Masked Lords.</li>
<li>If the Cassalanters are the main villains, Yalah is a fawning member of their Asmodeus-worshiping cult and intends to deliver the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to them as a demonstration of her fealty and friendship.</li>
<li>If Jarlaxle is the main villain, he and Yalah are secret lovers. He has promised to facilitate her rise in power after he uses Lord Neverember&rsquo;s lost hoard to buy Luskan&rsquo;s way into the Lords' Alliance.</li>
<li>If Manshoon is the main villain, he promised not to destroy Yalah&rsquo;s family if she allowed her villa to be used as a staging area for his secret plots. Believing that Urstul Floxin is after the gold for himself, Yalah plans to cut Urstul out of the deal and deliver the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> to Manshoon herself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having gravely misjudged and underestimated Lady Gralhund once, Urstul isn&rsquo;t about to do so again. Rallying despite his injuries, he manages to kill the two inattentive Gralhund guards who were watching over him and alert the other Zhents on the estate, who begin dispatching the other guards and servants. Urstul&rsquo;s goal is to capture Lord or Lady Gralhund, force the surrender of the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>, and deliver it to his master Manshoon in Kolat Towers (described in chapter 8).</p>
<p>Urstul&rsquo;s plans-unbeknownst to him-are dashed when Lady Gralhund orders her nimblewright to take the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> elsewhere. Amid the chaos, the nimblewright flees the estate.</p>

Their two basic choices are to share what they know with the City Watch or to visit Gralhund Villa themselves.</p>
<h4 id=let-the-watch-handle-it>
<a href=#let-the-watch-handle-it class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Let the Watch Handle It</h4><p>The characters can go to any City Watch station in the North Ward and report what they have learned to the constables there. Shortly thereafter, the characters receive a visit from Barnibus Blastwind and Saeth Cromley (see appendix B), who have no reason to suspect the characters are lying. Their own investigation corroborates much of what the characters said. Barnibus concludes the meeting by saying, rather brusquely, &ldquo;Thank you for the information.&rdquo; Cromley adds, &ldquo;Rest assured, we&rsquo;ll have this case resolved in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A magistrate provides the City Watch with a warrant to search Gralhund Villa. Sometime afterward, Cromley visits the characters by himself and, as a courtesy, tells them what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Officers arrived to find Lord Gralhund <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>, Lady Gralhund in shock, and their half-orc bodyguard bloodied but unbowed.</li>
<li>Apparently, the Gralhunds had been held hostage for more than a tenday by agents of the Black Network. Most of the Zhents were killed during a bloody revolt led by Lord Gralhund himself.</li>
<li>The Zhent leader, Urstul Floxin, was among those who got away. He&rsquo;s still at large. The Watch plans to step up its search for him.</li>
<li>Of the nimblewright, there was no sign. According to the Gralhunds, the construct was delivered to Gralhund Villa weeks earlier. The family took it in, not realizing it was a Zhentarim spy. Lady Gralhund reported that it stole her <wc-fetch type=item>necklace of fireballs</wc-fetch>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cromley&rsquo;s summary of events is based on information given to the City Watch by the Gralhunds and is riddled with falsehoods. The hostage situation, Lord Gralhund&rsquo;s heroism, and the theft of Lady Gralhund&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=item>necklace of fireballs</wc-fetch> never happened. The nimblewright&rsquo;s affiliation with the Zhentarim is also a lie. The Gralhunds' account further doesn&rsquo;t explain why the nimblewright would use the <wc-fetch type=item>necklace of fireballs</wc-fetch> to inflict harm on the Zhents if it was working with them. If characters raise that question, Cromley thinks for a moment and then ventures the guess that the nimblewright underestimated the necklace&rsquo;s explosive power.</p>
<h4 id=investigate-the-villa>

<p>Sneaking in or out of the villa without being seen or heard by neighbors and passersby requires each character to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. A character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill can take disadvantage on the check to grant advantage on another party member&rsquo;s check (essentially compensating for a less stealthy companion).</p>
<p>If the characters side with the Gralhunds in the conflict, Lady Gralhund is inclined to overlook their trespass. Her demeanor sours, however, if they start asking too many questions. She vigorously denies accusations that her family is involved with the Black Network and claims the Zhents were holding her family hostage (a false claim also parroted by her husband, her bodyguard, her children, and her staff). If the characters assault any member of the household or brandish weapons in an attempt to intimidate, the Gralhunds inform the City Watch of the party&rsquo;s crimes.</p>
<p>During the characters' invasion of Gralhund Villa, the nimblewright flees the estate with the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> (see chapter 4 for more information on its destination). If the characters are using Nim&rsquo;s nimblewright detector to track the nimblewright, the device lets them know that the nimblewright has fled the scene, but not the direction it went.</p>

<li>The estate is enclosed by 12-foot-high stone walls that require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to negotiate without the aid of climbing gear or magic.</li>
<li>Neighbors and bystanders alert the City Watch if they hear loud, disturbing noises (such as a <wc-fetch type=spell>thunderwave</wc-fetch> spell) coming from the estate or if they see anything suspicious.

A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic emanating from the tome.</p>
<p>The tome is meant to be unlocked using a key that Lady Gralhund wears on a chain around her neck. The lock can be picked by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or it can be opened with a <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic. Opening the book by any means other than using the proper key causes three specter to appear within 10 feet of the book and attack its opener. The magic that binds the specters has weakened over time; they can exist on the Material Plane for only 1 minute, after which time they are banished to the Ethereal Plane (unless destroyed first). The specters manifest as ghostly tieflings with elongated fingers.</p>
<p>The Gralhund family crest appears on the book&rsquo;s title page. The rest of the book is written in Common and describes births, deaths, and other family events between 1239 DR, the Year of the Bloodied Sword, and 1422 DR, the Year of Advancing Shadows. Of particular note is the little-known fact that the Gralhunds forged pacts with devils in years past, giving rise to a strain of tieflings. All such members of the house were sent to live on a Gralhund estate in Yartar, a city far to the north (or so the book claims in its epilogue), and there are passing references to some Waterdavian family members having been born with tails.</p>

Guest Suite</h4><p>Until recently, this suite was set aside for the use of Urstul Floxin. Lord Gralhund has barricaded himself in area G15b, using heavy furniture to block the door. Forcing it open requires a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p>The characters encounter Urstul Floxin (see appendix B) in area G15a. Urstul is wounded with 50 hit points remaining and has no poison coating his weapons, reducing his challenge rating to 3 (700 XP). He&rsquo;s trying to kick open the door to area G15b in a desperate attempt to capture Lord Gralhund and trade him for the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch>. If he is accosted before reaching Lord Gralhund, Urstul tries to flee the villa and uses any other surviving Zhents to cover his escape. He knows the same information that Lord Gralhund does (see &ldquo;Orond Gralhund&rdquo; below) but won&rsquo;t divulge it or the name of his master, Manshoon, unless he&rsquo;s magically compelled to do so.</p>
<p>Area G15a is a bathroom. A curtain to the east has been drawn back, revealing a claw-footed bathtub.</p>
<p>Area G15b is a wood-paneled bedchamber with a birdcage on a table and a permanent teleportation circle inscribed on the floor. The birdcage contains three flying snake that Urstul uses to deliver messages to his spies throughout the city. The circle is used by Manshoon to meet secretly with Urstul Floxin and to teleport Zhents to and from Kolat Towers (see chapter 8). See the <wc-fetch type=spell>teleportation circle</wc-fetch> spell description in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook for more information on how the circle functions.</p>

Although he&rsquo;s armed with a rapier, Orond throws himself at the mercy of the first person to bust through his barricade.</p>
<p>Characters who have Lord Gralhund at their mercy can pry the following information from him with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, but the check is made with disadvantage if Lord Gralhund has reason to believe his wife can see or overhear the conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> is some kind of ancient creature transformed into an artifact. It knows the location of a hidden vault in Waterdeep containing half a million dragons.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;House Gralhund has been bankrolling Black Network operations in Waterdeep, including the plot to kidnap Renaer Neverember and the plot to steal the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> from his father&rsquo;s gnome spy, Dalakhar.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;My wife was frustrated with the Zhents and their inability to secure the artifact. She gave a <wc-fetch type=item>necklace of fireballs</wc-fetch> to her mechanical servant and sent it out to help retrieve the stone.

<li>Yalah Gralhund, wearing a breastplate and armed with a rapier, stands next to her well-dressed half-orc bodyguard, Hrabbaz (see appendix B for their statistics).</li>
<li>A locked wooden trunk rests at the foot of a large, canopied bed in the southwest corner.</li>
<li>A claw-footed bathtub sits in the northwest alcove near a freestanding mirror and a privacy screen.</li>
<li>Hanging above a fireplace in the southeast corner is a shield that bears the Gralhund coat of arms. Logs are stacked neatly next to the hearth.</li>

Its escape is crucial, since it sets into motion the events in chapter 4.</p>
<p>Lady Gralhund and Hrabbaz are the only people who know where the nimblewright has gone, but they feign ignorance when questioned about it.</p>
<p>Yalah Gralhund carries a ring of keys that open all locked doors in the mansion, as well as the locked wooden trunk at the foot of the bed. If her situation turns dire and Hrabbaz is unable to protect her, Yalah unlocks the door to <strong>area G18</strong>, rushes inside, and locks the door behind her with her next action. She makes her final stand there, with her children cowering behind her.</p>

The trunk appears to contain folded clothes and shoes. A secret compartment in the bottom can be detected by someone who examines the outside of the trunk and makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The compartment holds two holy symbols of Asmodeus and two robes, each red and gold in color.</p>
<p>Lord and Lady Gralhund are both secret members of a cult of Asmodeus worshipers popular among select nobles in Waterdeep. The cult is led by Lord Victoro Cassalanter (see appendix B), though the Gralhunds won&rsquo;t divulge this information willingly.</p>

Servants' Wing</h4><p>Three rooms in the southeast area of the upper floor are where the servants sleep at night. The head butler and head maid have rooms to themselves, but those places are currently unoccupied. The largest of the three chambers is a common room containing six bunk beds for the junior staff. A total of nine maids, cooks, and valets (commoner) are holed up here, waiting for someone to rescue them. They are armed with improvised weapons (rolling pins, mops, brooms, and the like) that are treated as clubs.</p>

<p>Even if the bloody conflict at Gralhund Villa goes unnoticed outside the walls of the estate, the carnage can&rsquo;t be hidden from the City Watch for long. There are too many murdered servants and guards for anyone to conceal what has transpired. The arrival of the City Watch foreshadows the return of Barnibus Blastwind and Saeth Cromley (see appendix B), who arrive in due course with twenty constables (veteran) and two griffon cavalry rider (see appendix B) astride griffon. The griffons and their riders remain airborne, providing aerial support and reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Barnibus thoroughly investigates the Gralhund Villa crime scene and questions neighbors and bystanders. Characters who are seen leaving the scene become suspects. If the characters killed any members of the Gralhund family and left witnesses or evidence of the act, Barnibus instructs Sergeant Cromley to arrest them for the crime of murdering a noble, which carries a death sentence if they&rsquo;re found guilty.</p>

Even members of the Zhentarim who have no known criminal ties are rounded up and interrogated, including Davil Starsong (see appendix B). Characters who are members of the faction are safe for the time being, as long as they keep a low profile. Otherwise, they too are rounded up and questioned over a period of several days, until the Lords of Waterdeep ascertain their level of involvement in the violence at Gralhund Villa. The broadsheets jump on the bandwagon by portraying the Black Network in the most unflattering light, thus dealing a crippling blow to the faction&rsquo;s already questionable reputation.</p>

After Davil Starsong is taken in for questioning, Istrid Horn (see appendix B) sends a message to the characters by way of a flying snake. The message, written in Common, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to know more about what happened at Gralhund Villa. If you can spare the time, meet me at Ahghairon&rsquo;s Statue in the City of the Dead at highsun tomorrow. You&rsquo;ll be paid generously for your time and trouble.</p>
<p>-Istrid Horn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters attend the meeting, use the following boxed text to help set the scene, embellishing it to reflect the season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahghairon&rsquo;s Statue is a well-known landmark in the city&rsquo;s parkland cemetery: a tall, marble sculpture of a bearded, robed wizard standing atop concentric steps and facing west toward the skyline of Waterdeep, his hands outstretched and a broad smile on his face. At the foot of the statue stands a female dwarf clad in plate armor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the weather is fair, characters can see pedestrians, picnickers, and frolicking children throughout the cemetery grounds. It&rsquo;s clear that Istrid chose a safe, public place for the meeting. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that she came alone.</p>
<p>Istrid fears being arrested by the City Watch. Although she wasn&rsquo;t involved in the matters concerning Gralhund Villa, she is worried that the Watch will uncover her illegal currency-lending operation in the course of its investigations. She offers the characters 10 pp just for meeting with her and promises another 40 pp if the characters agree to help her lie low for a tenday-half to be paid once a deal is struck and half at the end of her stay. If they decline her offer and the party includes one or more Zhentarim members, she threatens that if she&rsquo;s arrested and charged with a crime, she will reveal their affiliation and bring them down with her.</p>
<h5 id=hiding-istrid>
<a href=#hiding-istrid class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Hiding Istrid</h5><p>If the characters decide to let Istrid hide out at their tavern, she uses a disguise kit to make herself up to be a male dwarf named Jorn. If asked to do so, she&rsquo;s willing to perform chores around the place once she settles in. Ultimately, no one comes looking for her, but the longer she stays hidden, the more testy and demanding she becomes.</p>
<p>If the characters tolerate her bad behavior, Istrid leaves at the end of the tenday as promised and pays characters the remainder of what she owes. Characters who are members of the Zhentarim gain an added benefit for harboring Istrid in her time of need: their renown in the faction increases by 2.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the characters throw her out or rat her out to the City Watch, Istrid becomes their mortal enemy and tries to undermine them at every turn.</p>

If the characters betray or harm Istrid, her former adventuring companions use every resource at their disposal to ruin the characters. The laws of Waterdeep discourage them from attacking the characters openly, but they can damage the party&rsquo;s business by scaring off their clientele, and characters might find themselves the targets of worse if they dare to leave the confines of the city.</p>

Otherwise, they are still 3rd level at the start of chapter 4.</p>
