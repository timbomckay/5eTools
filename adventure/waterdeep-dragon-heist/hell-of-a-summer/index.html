<p>Victoro and Ammalia Cassalanter struck a deal with Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells. Three years ago, they traded away the souls of their children to escape financial ruin. The soul of their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately. What was left behind was transformed into a chain devil, which the Cassalanters confined to their attic. Their two youngest children, Terenzio and Elzerina, are doomed to lose their souls when they turn nine years old a mere ten days after Founders' Day, a midsummer festival that celebrates Waterdeep&rsquo;s founding.</p>
<p>After the deal was struck, the Cassalanters enjoyed a miraculous comeback. Their banking and money-lending business thrived while their competition suffered. The disappearance of their eldest son (and heir apparent) earned them sympathy. Their philanthropic endeavors bought them legitimacy and new friends. They became the envy of Waterdavian nobility in short order. Seemingly blessed, the Cassalanters attracted new followers to their cult of devil worship, which was Asmodeus&rsquo;s plan all along.</p>
<p>Reneging on a contract with Asmodeus is a luxury no mortal can afford, but there is a way for Lord and Lady Cassalanter to save the souls of Terenzio and Elzerina. A clause in the contract allows them to preserve their remaining (and future) children&rsquo;s lives by instead paying &ldquo;one shy of a million gold coins, and the sacrifice of one shy of one hundred unfortunate souls.&rdquo; The Cassalanters have most of the coin they need, but they require the gold from the Vault of Dragons to buy their children&rsquo;s salvation without bankrupting themselves.</p>
<p>Victoro is in charge of locating the Vault of Dragons and securing the gold within it. Ammalia, for her part, plans to sacrifice ninety-nine souls in one fell swoop by throwing a feast on Founders' Day featuring <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> food. Both the souls and the gold must be paid to Asmodeus at the same time. Foiling either one of these schemes spells doom for the Cassalanters' plot and their youngest children.</p>

The cult convenes at midnight once every tenday in the temple of Asmodeus beneath Cassalanter Villa.

The masks and daggers are worth 75 gp each for the gold alone.</p>

<p>Each member of the Cassalanter family relaxes in different parts of the house and reacts separately to the discovery of characters intruding in their home. Lord and Lady Cassalanter are often out of the house on business, especially as Founders' Day draws near; they return home an hour before dinner.</p>

She attempts to gain the intruders' confidence by pretending to believe that they are guests of Victoro&rsquo;s and saying that she simply was not told of their presence. With this pretense established, she tries to learn the characters' true intentions, casting <wc-fetch type=spell>charm person</wc-fetch> on the party using a 5th-level spell slot (affecting up to five creatures within 30 feet) if necessary. Using magic in this way is illegal, but Ammalia has a lot of goodwill banked in Waterdeep-enough to curry favor with a magistrate.</p>
<p>During the hours when Ammalia is home and awake, her location in the villa can be determined randomly:</p>

He demands to know their names and calls for the butler, Willifort Crowelle, to show them out. If he has the chance, he subtly casts <wc-fetch type=spell>dominate person</wc-fetch> on one of the characters using an 8th-level spell slot (extending its duration to 8 hours) to plant a spy among their ranks.

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Cassalanters fell on hard times a few years back, but they have since reversed their fortunes and restored their lucrative banking and money-lending business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Victoro and Ammalia&rsquo;s eldest son disappeared three years ago when the family was on the verge of bankruptcy. They have two surviving children, young twins named Terenzio and Elzerina.</p>

<li>
<p>Lord Victoro Cassalanter is the only living heir of the late Caladorn Cassalanter, a former Masked Lord and a hero of the North.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the years, the Cassalanters have founded a number of philanthropic societies and made generous donations to temples dedicated to good-aligned deities. They are known to worship Siamorphe, a demigod whose ethos is the nobility&rsquo;s right and responsibility to rule.</p>

Around strangers, Terenzio becomes suspicious and meek, while Elzerina seems brash and outgoing. Both children are incredibly excited to meet friendly strangers and treat their &ldquo;new friends&rdquo; to a trip around the house.

<p>If asked about their older brother, Osvaldo, Terenzio and Elzerina repeat what their parents have told them: he&rsquo;s attending school in a faraway city (they don&rsquo;t recall which one).

If one is assailed within Cassalanter Villa, the other arrives as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>A direct confrontation with the Cassalanters will likely result in defeat for the characters, or-if the characters and the Cassalanters both escape with their lives-their arrest for assaulting nobility. The Cassalanters have no desire to kill the characters, even in self-defense. They take great pains to divide and subdue the party with their magic while not inflicting grievous harm.</p>
<p>If the characters reduce Ammalia to 30 hit points or fewer and Victoro is with her, he banishes her to safety for a few brief moments while he continues fighting. If either Victoro or Ammalia is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer and the other Cassalanter isn&rsquo;t present, they try to negotiate with or bribe their assailants.</p>
<p>The Cassalanters don&rsquo;t fear being arrested, since they have faith that their wealth, reputations, and contacts will keep them out of prison. They do fear the ticking clock of Founders' Day. They plead for the characters to allow them to carry out their plan, if only to save Terenzio&rsquo;s and Elzerina&rsquo;s lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cassalanter Villa&rsquo;s stark white walls and gleaming crimson roof and turrets stand out even among the other opulent estates of the Sea Ward. A three-story mansion lies in the midst of picturesque green gardens dappled with hedges and water features. The estate is surrounded by a tall white brick wall, with a single wrought-iron gate as an entrance. The Cassalanter family crest-a green Y overlapping a stylized goose being fed-is emblazoned on the gate, and armored guards stand at attention on either side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cassalanter Villa is an extravagant manse with dozens of lavish chambers for the masters of the house and their guests-but its splendor belies the terrible secret it holds. The temple of Siamorphe that once lay beneath the estate has been desecrated by Victoro and Ammalia&rsquo;s devil-worship. Now, this great chapel is dedicated to the Lord of the Nine Hells.</p>

Two of them stand outside the gate of the estate, two more stand outside the front door of the house, and a total of six patrol the grounds at any time. These guards are humans and are outfitted in livery that bears the crest of House Cassalanter.</p>
<p>The house is surrounded by a well-manicured lawn. A cobblestone path leads from the estate&rsquo;s exterior gate to both the front entrance (<strong>area C1</strong>) and the entrance to the coach house (area CH1). The villa&rsquo;s grounds feature numerous deciduous trees and meticulously tended gardens.</p>

The security detail around Cassalanter Villa is meant to raise an alarm and deter petty thieves, not to stop determined adventurers. If the guards spot an intruder, they do the sensible thing: call the authorities.</p>
<p>The City Watch has small, single-person &ldquo;watch boxes&rdquo; set up on nearly every street corner in the Sea Ward, including the intersection just outside the gates of Cassalanter Villa. If a guard sounds the alarm, the Watch member on duty fetches a force of forty City Watch veteran to cordon off the property.</p>

The number of guards patrolling the grounds doubles, and Victoro dispenses with all human guards inside the house. Whenever a guard is mentioned in an interior area, that guard is now a bearded devil disguised as a human. A disguised devil looks like a muscular, bearded male human in house livery. A creature that observes one closely can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, notice its &ldquo;beard&rdquo; writhing.</p>

All the other servants who work at the villa live in dingy homes in the Dock Ward or the Field Ward and travel across the city in the wee hours of the morning to arrive before the Cassalanters awake.</p>
<p>With the exception of their personal attendants, the Cassalanters replenish their servants regularly. Most move on to other jobs, but occasionally a servant discovers the secret vault (<strong>area C29</strong>), visits the forbidden attic (<strong>area C24</strong>), or otherwise learns too much.

<li>Doors are made of exotic hardwood.

Victoro, Ammalia, and the head butler, Willifort, hold keys to every room in the house.</li>
<li>Floors are made of wood and covered with soft woolen carpets. Creatures walking in carpeted rooms have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</li>
<li>All areas are well lit by oil lamps, lanterns, or chandeliers.</li>

<p>Osvaldo Cassalanter (see appendix B) shrieks and moans at all hours of the day. He is trying desperately to get someone to hear him and come to his rescue. If one or both of his parents are here, he spits curses at them as they weep before him.</p>
<p>Guarding the room are two imp in spider form. They answer to Lord Cassalanter, and their job is to kill birds, rat, and other vermin that find their way into the attic. They attack anyone who tries to free Osvaldo or threatens other family members present.</p>
<p>The Cassalanter heir apparent is a soulless abomination thanks to his parents' thoughtless greed. His empty shell of a body has been transformed into a chain devil that his parents have imprisoned using his own chains. A 10-foot-diameter pentagram has been burned into the floor around him. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals a powerful aura of abjuration magic emanating from the symbol.</p>
<p>Osvaldo&rsquo;s chains are wrapped around the beams and timbers that frame the room. He can&rsquo;t damage the house, nor can he break his own chains. He can only howl impotently at the misery being inflicted on him. He is thoroughly insane and can&rsquo;t be reasoned with.</p>
<p>A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the pentagram prevents Osvaldo from manipulating his chains, and that the effect ends if another creature enters the area encompassed by the pentagram. The magic of the pentagram can also be dispelled (DC 15). If he is freed, Osvaldo regains control of his chains and attacks indiscriminately. If he is reduced to 0 hit points, the chain devil cries out for his mother before melting into a pool of sickening black ichor.</p>

Butterfly Garden</h4><p>In the spring, Ammalia Cassalanter&rsquo;s gardens attract caterpillars, which transform into butterflies come summer. Lady Cassalanter&rsquo;s butterfly garden is the envy of her peers. The sweet scent of flowers and herbs filters up from the planters and rose bushes.</p>
<p>If Terenzio and Elzerina are here, they are frolicking in the garden. If Ammalia Cassalanter (see appendix B) is here, she&rsquo;s watching the children or tending to her garden. Six imp in raven form hang around the butterfly garden and occasionally prey on Ammalia&rsquo;s prized pets when their mistress isn&rsquo;t looking. Despite their insolence, Ammalia uses these imps as spies. She sends them on missions throughout the city. They also warn Ammalia of trespassers and attack anyone who threatens a member of her family.</p>

During these ceremonies, they pledge their devotion to the Lord of the Nine Hells, call out the names of their enemies, and beseech Asmodeus to visit ruin upon their foes. They also drink wine, share gossip, and offer the occasional sacrifice. For the Cassalanters, these events are opportunities to flaunt their power and impose their will on their lessers.</p>

<p>The spirits of several dead members of the Cassalanter family are bound to this crypt.

<p>The ghost is all that remains of Caladorn Cassalanter, a former Masked Lord and hero of Waterdeep. The ghost halts its attack and calls off the specters if a character wears or presents a holy symbol of Siamorphe.

<p>Armed with the <wc-fetch type=item>Stone of Golorr</wc-fetch> and the keys to unlock the Vault of Dragons, Victoro Cassalanter enters the vault, uses a <wc-fetch type=spell>disguise self</wc-fetch> spell to appear as Lord Dagult Neverember, and tricks Aurinax the gold dragon into relinquishing the gold. A dozen House Cassalanter guard disguised as members of the City Guard stuff the gold into sacks while a dozen more haul the sacks to a pair of waiting carriages for safe transport back to Cassalanter Villa. Each sack holds 1,000 gp, and each carriage can hold fifty sacks (50,000 gp) at a time. Getting the gold from the Vault of Dragons to Cassalanter Villa takes ten round trips (five per carriage) and the better part of a day. Three <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> imp accompany each carriage, which is driven by a bearded devil wearing a hat and a high-collared cape to conceal its true nature. Upon arrival at Cassalanter Villa, each carriage is met by a dozen guard in House Cassalanter livery, who unload the sacks of gold and place them in <strong>area C29</strong>.</p>

<p>Ammalia Cassalanter hosts a grand party on Founders' Day that begins in the early afternoon and ends at midnight. Wealthy guests begin to arrive in the late afternoon and gather inside the villa, away from the sun and heat, while one hundred of Waterdeep&rsquo;s poorest residents-most brought from the Field Ward-gather under pavilions set up on the lawn. Hired actors dressed as Waterdeep&rsquo;s founders parade around, and bards play lively tunes. No one suspects that the food in the pavilion tents has been laced with midnight tears-a poison that will slay the impoverished guests at the stroke of midnight. Ammalia is immune to poison and thus partakes freely of the delicious food. Wealthy guests who remain holed up in Cassalanter Villa eat and drink at separate tables and are spared a grisly end.</p>
<p>An hour before midnight, the entertainers disperse as Ammalia begins making toasts to her wealthy guests, turning them into unwitting accomplices by virtue of their presence and thus ensuring their silence. Meanwhile, house guards prevent any of the rabble from leaving, forcibly detaining anyone who tries to flee. Unless the characters prevent the poor folk from eating the tainted food, those attendees consume the poison and perish at the stroke of midnight.</p>
<p>While Ammalia plays host, Victoro instructs his cultists to remove the sacks of gold from House Cassalanter&rsquo;s vault (<strong>area C29</strong>) and hurl them into the sacrificial bowl (<strong>area A7</strong>). They finish shortly before midnight. At the stroke of midnight, as the poison does its work, Ammalia keeps an eye on her wealthy guests and orders Tessina Khyret to notify Victoro that the deed is done. Standing before the statue of Asmodeus in the temple, Victoro summons a barbed devil and informs it that payment has been made in full. The devil declares (in Infernal) that the payment is &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; and informs Victoro that the souls of Terenzio and Elzerina will not be taken to the Nine Hells. It then disappears whence it came, leaving the Cassalanters to bask in their triumph.</p>
<p>After the party, in the dark hours of morning, the corpses of the dead are cast into the fiery bowl in <strong>area A7</strong>, leaving no evidence of foul play. In the days and months that follow, Victoro and Ammalia use threats of diabolical retribution to silence witnesses and wield their political clout to quash criminal investigations.</p>
