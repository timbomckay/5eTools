It is set in the Tenth District of Ravnica and serves as an introductory adventure to the setting. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges. Adventurers can be affiliated with any of the guilds.</p>

He has managed to cause no end of trouble for the citizens of the Tenth District, but not without attracting the attention of the guilds. A cunning opportunist, Krenko has spent years consolidating goblin street rabble into his fiercely loyal gang. He cultivated connections among the ruthless and powerful, specializing in high-value theft and mayhem. At the apex of his influence, he got into a nasty turf war with the Shattergang Brothers, a rival goblin gang that often deals in illicit arms. Rumors swirled that Krenko killed Dargig, the youngest of the three brothers, after a weapons drop went bad.</p>
<p>The remaining two brothers, Rikkig and Gardagig, attempted to kill Krenko in retaliation for the death of their kin. Before they could do the deed, Krenko was apprehended by the Boros Legion and thrown into Sawtooth Prisonâ€”near the legion&rsquo;s headquarters of Sunhomeâ€”to spend the rest of his life behind bars. But someone as well connected as Krenko has ways of shortening his own sentence.</p>
<p>Inciting a riot in prison secured him a transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security facility in Precinct Two of the Tenth District, administered by the Azorius Senate. During the transfer, agents of a former associate of Krenko&rsquo;s created a distraction, and he was able to slip away to rendezvous with his gang. He now plots his next move as he reestablishes power over his criminal enterprise.</p>
<p>Krenko&rsquo;s escape is no small matter. The Chamber of the Guildpact gets involved, alarmed at the possibility of another goblin gang war that could threaten the tenuous peace between the guilds. During the adventure, the Shattergang Brothers catch wind of Krenko&rsquo;s freedom, and are desperate to make him pay.</p>

As you build your own adventures in Ravnica, you can use the suggestions in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide for creating villains to craft a guildless villain, one who prefers the independence of operating outside the guild structure or even seeks to undermine that structure entirely. More often than not, though, the guilds turn out to be involved in the schemes of even minor villains.</p>

<p>The adventure begins at Sawtooth Prison as the party is summoned by Nassius Ven, an official from the Chamber of the Guildpact. He explains that Krenko has escaped during a prison transfer, and it&rsquo;s urgent that the characters locate him and bring him back to justice as soon as possible and with discretion.</p>
<p>The characters can retrace the route of the transfer, interview the guards for more information, and use their contacts in the city to find out more about Krenko. If they are indiscreet in their investigation, they could attract the attention of the Shattergang Brothers, a rival gang intent on murdering Krenko. Members of that gang will trail the party throughout the city in an attempt to find the goblin mob boss&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p>Eventually, the adventurers find Krenko&rsquo;s hideout: a warehouse near a canal. A final showdown with the goblin mob boss, his retinue, and possible Shattergang interlopers ensues. Then it&rsquo;s merely a matter of delivering Krenko back to Nassius before more trouble breaks out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life in the Tenth District is never dull. A hub of constant activity, it always offers a new opportunity, a new challenge, a new intrigue. It is a place where a promising adventurer like you can find your path to glory, riches, or power through your allegiance to your guild. But first you&rsquo;ll need a job that will help you prove your worth.</p>
<p>Today is your lucky day. This afternoon, you received a brief note from one of your contacts: &ldquo;I heard today from someone who is looking for help finding something. Seems serious. Might be a good opportunity for you. Meet outside Sawtooth Prison at dusk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the appointed time, you find yourself gathered with other like-minded individuals outside the front door to the functional and unremarkable Sawtooth Prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have the players introduce their characters to each other, if they aren&rsquo;t acquainted already. This might also be a time for the characters to identify or discover personal connections that might link them, such as common acquaintances or contacts, a shared background, or living in the same neighborhood. Once the characters have had a chance to get to know one another, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Light rain begins to patter on the cobblestones as the sun sets behind the spires and towers of the city. You see a male vedalken in well-tailored clothes approach your group from around the side of the prison. His deep blue face bears a gentle but concerned expression. He raises his hand to hail you and speaks in a low tone as his eyes take in your group and the nearby environs. &ldquo;Are you here to help us find something?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Nassius Ven, a vedalken noble and a proctor from the office of the Guildpact. While the Azorius and Boros help maintain the law and keep the peace, the office of the Guildpact tries to help quell disputes between the guilds while the Living Guildpact is away. Nassius is here to hire the characters to track down Krenko because he suspects the involvement of one or more guilds in the goblin boss&rsquo;s escape but doesn&rsquo;t know who is involved.</p>

</span></p>
<p>After receiving affirmative answers from the party, Nassius hands the characters a dossier from Sawtooth Prison with an image of a smug, tough-looking male goblin on it. Nassius offers up the following information, which can be conveyed through conversation with him:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;We have need of your particular skills to assist in the retrieval of a convict who got loose just before sunrise this morning. He escaped during his transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security prison where he would have spent the rest of his days.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;His name is Krenko. He&rsquo;s the boss of a large gang of goblins that operates around Foundry Street. He was apprehended to answer for a long list of crimes, including murder. He allegedly incited a riot that led to the deaths of a guard and two inmates at this prison a week ago. The warden decided enough was enough and put through his transfer.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Krenko has made a lot of enemies, but the Shattergang Brothers are his biggest threat. They&rsquo;re a rival goblin gang specializing in illicit weapons, and they want Krenko dead in reprisal for the murder of one of their lieutenants. The dead lieutenant also happens to be the youngest of the three siblings that run the gang. They&rsquo;ll tear apart the neighborhood to find him once they know he has escaped.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Normally, we&rsquo;d let the Azorius deal with this situation, but we suspect that Krenko might have had help from one of the other guilds when he escaped. We are enlisting others to investigate that connection, as it could point to a bigger problem.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We need you to track down Krenko and bring him back alive. Then we can interrogate him and keep him off the streets for good.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am prepared to give you ten zinos right now to cover any expenses you might incur during your investigation. Upon delivery of the criminal, you&rsquo;ll receive one hundred zinos and my gratitude, which I will convey to your guild leaders. Under no circumstances should you attempt to question Krenko yourselves.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>If he is asked, Nassius provides the guards' account of the circumstances of his escape (see &ldquo;Krenko&rsquo;s Patron&rdquo;). The guards have already been thoroughly questioned, and Krenko&rsquo;s trail has gone cold. Nassius is eager to get the characters started as soon as possible to prevent the Shattergang Brothers from learning of Krenko&rsquo;s escape.</p>
<p>Nassius asks the party to bring Krenko to an old Selesnya granary that was damaged in a Gruul raid at the edge of the district. There, he&rsquo;ll take Krenko into custody.</p>
<p>Nassius is evasive about any questions regarding why Krenko shouldn&rsquo;t be interrogated or why the characters should bring him to the granary. His eyes dart back and forth when confronted with these sorts of questions. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check knows that Nassius isn&rsquo;t being completely forthright. Even if pressed, Nassius doesn&rsquo;t offer up any other information beyond the mission objectives.</p>

They can conduct their investigation however they choose, but time is of the essence since eventually word on the street gets back to the Shattergang Brothers and they start another turf war to flush Krenko out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Krenko has been a goblin mob boss for several years. His turf was around Foundry Street. He has been a person of interest in numerous crimes befitting a mobster but managed to evade the lawâ€”until recently.</li>
<li>Krenko was brought into custody by Gideon Jura, a freelancer working with the Boros Legion at the time. Krenko was found guilty of murdering Dargig, one of the Shattergang Brothers, and of assault with a deadly weapon against Gideon Jura.</li>
<li>The weapon on his person at the time of arrest was a magic shiv (a prison knife). Reportedly, it could punch through force barriers. It isn&rsquo;t known how Krenko obtained the weapon.</li>
<li>Krenko&rsquo;s notable associates include the mysterious Mr. Taz (no other information provided) and a renegade Izzet weapons inventor named Falish (female human, seen around Tin Street). Both are also persons of interest to the Azorius.</li>

After <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> hours, a character sifting through rumors makes a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check. On a success, they find out one previously unknown piece of information from among those given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Krenko&rsquo;s absence has hurt his gang&rsquo;s reputation. Other gangs have been encroaching on his territory, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before there&rsquo;s another power struggle played out in the streets.</li>
<li>Tin Street is a bustling center of trade and the territory of the Shattergang Brothers. They have become emboldened since Krenko was put away and are readying for war to take out his gang once and for all.</li>
<li>Foundry Street is where you&rsquo;ll find manufacturing facilities for the Tenth District, and it&rsquo;s Krenko&rsquo;s gang&rsquo;s turf. His enforcers are still squabbling over who should lead. For now, they all have an uneasy truce with each other.</li>
<li>Some goblins were pulling up a sewer grate at a very early hour west of the plaza. They didn&rsquo;t look like maintenance workers and threatened anyone that came too close. The approximate location of this incident is obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three locations important to the adventure are mentioned in the information above: the sewers, Foundry Street, and Tin Street. Each site is described in detail below. The travel time (on foot) between any two of these locations is 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
<h3 id=the-sewers-at-plaza-west>

It takes 1 hour and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check to find a grate with scrapes from a crowbar on it. Alternatively, the characters can interview residents in the area, in which case it takes half an hour and a successful DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check to find the location of the grate.</p>
<p>The grate can be pulled up with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Once the grate is opened, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A circular maintenance shaft plunges down into the darkness. An iron ladder is bolted to one side of the shaft. The pungent smell of the sewers wafts up to your nose. A faint light is visible at the bottom, illuminating refuse-filled water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no light source in the shaft, which continues down 50 feet until it ends in a folding ladder with a dangling cord. When unfolded, the ladder reaches another 20 feet to the sewer tunnel floor. When the characters descend to the floor, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You stand shin-deep in sewer water, in a dimly lit tunnel. There&rsquo;s a raised walkway on either side that gets you out of the smelly, muck-filled water. Small lamps housing magical flames shed dim light. The walls are covered in moss and lichen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tunnel is dimly lit by small <wc-fetch type=spell>continual flame</wc-fetch> beacons positioned every 30 feet or so on alternating sides of the 20-foot-high tunnel. The sewer tunnel is 30 feet wide and continues in both directions. The tunnel has a raised walkway 5 feet wide and 5 feet tall along both sides. The main passage is flowing with 1-foot-deep water and smelly refuse.</p>
<p>Krenko and three other goblins came this way, heading to his new hideout. The characters can spot signs of grimy boot prints made by Small creatures on one of the walkways by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. After finding the prints, they can continue to track them through the sewer tunnels by succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) check. For every day since the goblins came through here, add 5 to the DC of the check. It takes 2 hours to navigate the twisting tunnels at normal walking speed. The tunnels are near Golgari territory, but above the undercity.</p>
<p>For each hour the party spends in the sewers, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll>. On a 15 or higher, the party has an encounter determined by rolling on the Sewer Encounters table.</p>

<p>The tracks end at another maintenance shaft in the ceiling of the tunnel. A cord dangles down from the shaft; pulling on it releases a folding ladder that can easily be climbed. The shaft terminates in a grate, which can be pushed aside with a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p>
<p>The characters emerge in an alley beside an old warehouse on a canal dock near Foundry Street, in Precinct Six of the Tenth District. The tracks continue up to the warehouse.</p>

<p>This bustling market area is busy with the flow of merchants, entertainers, shoppers, and revelers. During daytime hours, Tin Street is a prime destination for shopping and dining. At night, theaters and taverns come alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tin Street is one of the two avenues that traverse the entire Tenth District (see chapter 3). Where it passes through Precinct Six, the Shattergang Brothers have claimed much of it as their turf. They keep a keen eye out for Azorius arresters, rival gang members, and anyone who asks too many questions.</p>
<p>Tin Street is also the home of Falish, a renegade Izzet arms dealer who, for the right price, supplies criminals with weapons and explosives.</p>
<h4 id=shattergang-eavesdropping>
<a href=#shattergang-eavesdropping class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Shattergang Eavesdropping</h4><p>If a check to gather rumors fails by 5 or more, or the characters are otherwise indiscreet while investigating around Tin Street, word gets to the Shattergang Brothers that someone has been asking about Krenko. They send an unremarkably dressed, beady-eyed goblin named Erko to tail the characters (about 60 feet) and sneak up to eavesdrop on conversations. If a character&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score equals or exceeds the goblin&rsquo;s Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check, that character notices that they&rsquo;re being followed or observed.</p>
<p>If Erko notices the party has seen him, he tries to run away, back to one of his gang&rsquo;s hideouts. As he makes his way down the busy market of Tin Street, you can conduct this scene as a chase, using the chase rules and the Urban Chase Complications table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.</p>
<p>In addition to his weapons, Erko carries a flask of alchemist&rsquo;s fire, which he hurls at the first creature that threatens him. See chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook for rules on using alchemist&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>If a character interrogates Erko and succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check, the goblin reveals that he works for the Shattergang Brothers, and they have an interest in knowing what goes on in their turf. He doesn&rsquo;t reveal their hideout under any circumstances.</p>
<p>If Erko tails the adventurers long enough to discover Krenko&rsquo;s location, the Shattergang Brothers arrive at Krenko&rsquo;s hideout in force 2 hours later.</p>

The tavern&rsquo;s owner and barkeep is Wyroon, a male minotaur with a cracked horn and a surly disposition. He was drummed out of the Boros Legion for insubordination a few years ago. His starting attitude is indifferent, but if a character succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check, he&rsquo;ll tell the characters that Falish comes down some nights for a drink or two.

Noggra often patches up injured gang members after their scuffles, and occasionally hides them from the law. She sometimes sells Falish alchemical substances to enhance her weapons. Her starting attitude toward the party is indifferent. If a character asks her about Falish and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check, she gives up Falish&rsquo;s location.

<blockquote>
<p>Following the directions to Falish&rsquo;s shop, you find yourself in an alley behind a restaurant. Near the back door to the establishment is a smaller, padlocked iron door that looks as if it came from a vault.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The door has a padlock that requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to pick with thieves' tools, or a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open. Once it is open, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the door, you see a narrow staircase that leads twenty feet down to a green-tinged copper door, with a closed sliding peephole in its center.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This copper door is locked and requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to open. It can also be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The door is trapped with a <wc-fetch type=spell>glyph of warding</wc-fetch> spell that triggers when a character attempts to pick the lock or force open the door. The triggered glyph casts <wc-fetch type=spell>sleep</wc-fetch> at 3rd level, affecting <wc-roll>9d8</wc-roll> hit points of creatures. A character who searches the door for traps can detect the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>When the characters enter the room, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The flickering glow of lanterns reveals a haphazard room that is thirty feet long and twenty feet wide, packed with equipment, tools, and materials. Hanging from the wall are all manner of weapons. Boxes and small crates are stuffed under tables that overflow with flasks. A workbench is piled high with tools. There&rsquo;s a small living area with a bed and a large iron stove in the back of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room serves as a laboratory, showroom, and living quarters for Falish, a human scorchbringer guard. She deals in alchemically treated weapons and explosives. A renegade who was expelled from the Izzet League, Falish maintains contacts within the guild, who provide her with the materials she uses to upgrade weapons. She sells her wares to many of the gangs in the Tenth District.</p>
<p>If characters trigger the glyph trap on the door, Falish grabs her gear and heads out through a secret door in the back of her living quarters as quickly as possible, closing the door behind her. The secret door opens into a tunnel that leads down into the sewers. When closed, the secret door can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>If the characters surprise Falish or manage to sneak in, she realizes she has no quick escape and is willing to cooperate to a certain extent to get the characters out of her home. In exchange for freedom, she reveals the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Krenko contacted her to deliver some weapons, explosives, and any magic items she had to a drop point on Foundry Street, outside the Smokehouse Inn. She&rsquo;s supposed to make the drop at sunset on the day after Krenko&rsquo;s escape.</li>
<li>Krenko is planning on using the weapons to launch a preemptive attack on the Shattergang Brothers to reassert that he&rsquo;s back in power.</li>
<li>Krenko is probably hiding somewhere near the drop point. Falish knows that Krenko and his rescuers were spotted entering a sewer grate west of the plaza.</li>

<p>Goblins are common in this part of the city, and it is Krenko&rsquo;s gang&rsquo;s turf. Most of the gang members now know that Krenko has escaped, and the bickering between his enforcers has subsided with Krenko back on the streets.</p>
<p>Most of the folk who live around Foundry Street know to report any Azorius presence or nosy outsiders to a goblin gang member that serves as the block captain. If the characters conduct their investigation here, Krenko&rsquo;s gang learns about it within half an hour and sends out a crew to deal with the situation.</p>

Once they have found the warehouse, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large, soot-stained wooden building with a faded symbol of the Boros Legion sits at the edge of a canal, its timbers cracked and singed. A closed bay door faces north toward the water, and a wooden track runs from the building all the way to the edge of a pier. A similar bay door faces south toward the main street. On the alley sides of the building are two doorsâ€”a double door on the west side, and a single door on the east side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This old warehouse used to store equipment finished from the nearby foundries for the Boros Legion&rsquo;s use. It was badly burned in a gang war a few years ago and has since been abandoned by the Boros. Krenko&rsquo;s gang has used it occasionally as a secret meeting spot, and now Krenko is using it as his hideout.</p>
<p>The warehouse is 40 feet tall, 60 feet wide, and 120 feet long. It has no windows, but the outer walls are brittle and fire-damaged; a number of small holes, 1 or 2 feet in diameter, have opened up in various places. Dealing 5 damage to a section of the wall creates an opening that a Medium or smaller creature can walk through.</p>

The goblins keep this area brightly lit, since their <wc-fetch type=sense>darkvision</wc-fetch> only extends for 60 feet. When the characters enter, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The glowing lantern light reveals a warehouse charred by a fire. To the north and south are large, iron-reinforced bay doors, operated from the ground by chains and pulleys. The western wall has a square room in the center that fills a twenty-foot-by-twenty-foot section of the warehouse floor. The room has a door and window on the side facing the center of the warehouse floor.</p>
<p>A catwalk encircles the interior twenty feet above the floor. Stairs lead up to it near the center of the eastern wall. Dozens of large boxes and crates are scattered around the warehouse, their integrity in question due to fire damage. A pair of wooden rails runs through the center of the room. On the rails sits a giant wooden wheeled cart. Towering over the cart is a ten-foot-high, soot-stained iron statue. It looks vaguely humanoid, with claw-like appendages at the ends of its arms. In place of its head is a cavity containing a seat with a series of levers all around it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dealing 20 damage or more to a bay door creates a hole that a Medium or smaller creature can walk through. A character can use an action to open a bay door using its pulley system.</p>
<p>Charred and cracked wooden containers are scattered around the room. Nothing of value remains in any of them.</p>
<p>Resting on the rails that run through the center of the room is a Large cart. The north and south walls of the cart can be lowered to create ramps leading up to the cart&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>Near the cart is a loading rig covered in soot and currently inactive. A seat cavity built into the top the rig contains a series of small plates and levers. A creature in the seat can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check to figure out how to press the plates in the correct sequence to activate or deactivate the rig. Pressing the plates requires an action. Once the rig is activated, a creature in the seat can pilot it using the levers. The rig moves as its controller directs it, and the controller can use an action to direct the rig to take the Dash, Disengage, or <wc-fetch type=action>Dodge</wc-fetch> action, or the Multiattack or Slam actions as given in its stat block.</p>
<p>A creature with tinker&rsquo;s tools can try to repair damage to the rig. After spending 1 hour making repairs, the creature makes a DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check. If the check succeeds, the rig regains <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> hit points.</p>

He runs to the loading rig on the warehouse floor and activates it in an effort to fight his way out and flee. If he can get outside, he makes his way to the dock and jumps into the canal to swim away.</p>
<p>If Krenko is captured, he tries to convince the adventurers that bringing him to justice isn&rsquo;t in the best interest of the city. He might make any or all of the following arguments in his defense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without his leadership, the goblin gangs have been thrown into chaos, and the only thing keeping the Shattergang Brothers from blowing things up is his gangâ€”with him leading it.</li>
<li>He is emphatic that his killing of Dargig was an act of self-defense and that he was framed by the Boros Legion, which he suspects is in league with the Shattergang Brothers. Characters who succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check sense he&rsquo;s lying, as he subtly looks past them while making his plea.</li>
<li>Krenko is willing to offer the party a deal. He&rsquo;ll give them everything in his office strongbox if they tell Nassius they didn&rsquo;t find him.</li>
<li>Krenko warns the party that Nassius isn&rsquo;t all he appears to be. Krenko suspects that Nassius is in someone&rsquo;s pocket but doesn&rsquo;t know who that someone is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Krenko doesn&rsquo;t offer up any information on the allies that aided him in his escape, but he identifies them if pressed. He also remains tight-lipped on the subject of Mr. Taz, offering only the following if a character makes a successful DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check: &ldquo;Mr. Taz gave me a nice shiv as a present for a job once, and I&rsquo;d love to get my mitts on another one someday.</p>
<h2 id=the-handoff>
<a href=#the-handoff class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Handoff</h2><p>When the characters reach the meeting point that Nassius specified, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the rain intensifies into a downpour, you head to the outskirts of the Tenth District. You&rsquo;re directed to the old granary that Nassius picked as the rendezvous point. The wet, crumbling clay building sits out in an untended field and is overgrown with all manner of vegetation, almost completely reclaimed by the wild. Nassius steps out of the entryway into the field, holding a small purse and flanked by two heavily armed guards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nassius has asked for Azorius assistance but has also brought two human veteran wearing no obvious guild identifiers to help take Krenko into custody. Six Azorius Soldier are hidden in various spots between 50 and 100 feet of the front of the granary, ready to subdue characters who make a wrong move, or to take down Krenko if he tries to flee.</p>
<p>Nassius wants the characters to complete the exchange without a fuss and head home. He asks them if they questioned Krenko, and to recount what the goblin said to them. Krenko attempts to call out Nassius as a liar and a corrupt official, but Nassius&rsquo;s veterans move to gag Krenko to stop him from talking.</p>
<p>Nassius doesn&rsquo;t answer any questions about where he&rsquo;s taking Krenko, nor does he address the veracity of any claims of corruption. He remarks that he serves the office of the Guildpact, and he&rsquo;s taking Krenko in for the good of the city. The Shattergang Brothers might still take over the turf of Krenko&rsquo;s gang, but probably without a destructive gang war.</p>

A patron approached Nassius and made a deal to have Krenko delivered to them instead of to his rightful place in his new cell at Udzec. Nassius was assured that Krenko would eventually make his way back to the prison alive, but the patron wanted to have a few words with him first.</p>
<p>To determine whom Nassius Ven cut a deal with, you can roll to determine a patron from the table below, or you can choose one. If the patron is a guild, you should select a guild that isn&rsquo;t represented by an adventurer in the party. The patron might influence future dealings with both Nassius Ven and Krenko.</p>

<p>In addition to the adventure seeds in the first part of this chapter, you can build on the events of this adventure to chart a course for the party&rsquo;s next adventures. Consider these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who were Krenko&rsquo;s and Nassius&rsquo;s allies? How might they respond to the characters' actions?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the balance of power between Krenko&rsquo;s gang and the Shattergang Brothers? Is either gang likely to take revenge on the characters for what they did? Or did the characters earn the gratitude of either gang?</li>
<li>How might Nassius, Krenko, Falish, and other NPCs interact with the adventurers in the future? Could one of them ask for the characters' help with a new crisis, or turn into a dangerous antagonist?</li>
<li>Did the characters use any of their contacts to gather information? Might those individuals' involvement cause them trouble that could involve the adventurers?</li>
