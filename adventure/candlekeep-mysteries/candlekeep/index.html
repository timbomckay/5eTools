<p>Standing atop a rocky crag overlooking the Sea of Swords, the massive citadel of Candlekeep has endured the elements for centuries and defied the degradations of time. Visible for miles around, Candlekeep has an eye-catching silhouette: a high wall interspersed with towers. This wall encloses a large space from which more towers rise. Those who behold the edifice say it looks like nothing so much as a cake decorated with an overabundance of candles.</p>
<p>The entrance to Candlekeep is a double gate that stands at the end of the Way of the Lion, the only road that provides access to and from the outside world. The route follows a lonely path across the peninsula where Candlekeep stands.</p>
<p>Those who gain entry discover a cloistered community of scholars milling around inside Candlekeep&rsquo;s walls, a place of enlightened conversation and friendly debate. No better place in the Realms exists for those who have a love for or a need of knowledge and who want to pursue such interests alongside fellow seekers.</p>
<p>Candlekeep has the largest repository of written lore in FaerÃ»n, including the collected prophecies of an ancient sage named Alaundo the Seer. Those compiled divinations make up a tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge and secrets contained in the library&rsquo;s vast collection.</p>
<p>Not all knowledge preserved in Candlekeep is of historical importance. The library holds thousands upon thousands of lost recipes, old songs, collections of folklore, and journals written by folks whose time has long since passed. The abundance of these ancillary works makes finding notable tomes an exercise in patience and perseverance. Fortunately, a legion of scholars and sages called the Avowed look after the library and remain vigilant in the care and cataloging of all the knowledge it holds.</p>

Those who show up at the gates without such a gift are kindly but firmly turned away.</p>
<p>The enormous double gates of Candlekeep are three times the height of a human and wrought of black metal magically warded to foil attempts to damage them. Both doors are emblazoned with the sigil of Candlekeep. One of the two gates stands open far enough to admit visitors during the day, and the other is kept shut.</p>
<p>Bedecked in purple vestments, five Avowed Priest of Deneir (god of writing) oversee the front gates, examining and discussing written works presented by hopefuls trying to gain entrance. If a question arises, the Avowed send a runner to consult with a sage in the library. The runner eventually returns bearing a missive of acceptance or denial. Visiting scholars experienced in this procedure often bring a selection of possible donations to ensure admittance. Despite the stringent entrance requirements, the Avowed do accept rare editions of tomes already in the collection, journals of those who recount unique or insightful experiences, or the odd work that has been annotated by a prominent scholar outside the library. Once granted admission, visitors quickly discover that it&rsquo;s wise to assemble a &ldquo;wish list&rdquo; of works that members of the senior staff are interested in collecting, potentially reducing the guesswork of readmission on future visits.</p>
<p>Those admitted to Candlekeep, referred to as seekers, can request the assistance of an Avowed adjutant who acts as a guide and research assistant for the duration of their visit. This guide has access to all the resources of the library, with the exception of the vaults that contain the rarest and most dangerous works. Seekers can appeal to higher-ranking Avowed for permission to peruse these off-limits works.</p>

Although most of the Avowed are humble scholars, a number of potent spellcasters fill critical posts. If trouble occurs, the Gatewarden (an archmage) and up to four Mage arrive to investigate immediately. If they can&rsquo;t bring the situation under control in short order, up to four additional Archmage arrive to lend assistance.</p>

The most innocuous include wards to protect the library&rsquo;s books from mold, weevils, and other threats. Other protections are more dramatic, as discussed below.</p>
<h5 id=magic-restriction>
<a href=#magic-restriction class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Magic Restriction</h5><p>Wards prevent anyone from entering Candlekeep by any route other than through the front gates. Any attempt to magically bypass these gates fails. These wards do not prevent creatures from using magic to exit Candlekeep.</p>
<p>Anyone who tries to fly over the wall into Candlekeep is stopped short. Magical flight is dispelled, and the subject floats slowly to the ground fifty feet outside the gates. An intangible ward forces creatures that can fly naturally to either land or circumnavigate Candlekeep altogether. Ordinary birds are unaffected by this ward, and a clever wizard or other individual can bypass the ward by assuming the form of a Tiny bird. The Avowed don&rsquo;t discuss this flaw with outsiders, but anyone who can see the gulls flying over Candlekeep can easily reach the conclusion that certain creatures are exempt from this magical restriction.</p>
<h5 id=fire-suppression>
<a href=#fire-suppression class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Fire Suppression</h5><p>Flames larger than a candle are suppressed within the keep. (The fireplace in the Hearth, Candlekeep&rsquo;s tavern, is an exception.) Thus, any spell that creates fire is wasted if it is cast within the keep.</p>
<h5 id=theft-protection>
<a href=#theft-protection class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Theft Protection</h5><p>Every book, scroll, and other work considered part of Candlekeep&rsquo;s collection is magically protected against theft. Any such work that is removed from the keep disappears and immediately returns to its proper place in the library.</p>
<p>This ward also has a flaw that the Avowed don&rsquo;t discuss with outsiders. If pages from a book or parts of a scroll are torn away, these fragments can be removed from Candlekeep as long as the bulk of the work remains in the library. Similarly, if a work is split into pieces and entirely removed from Candlekeep, only the largest piece disappears and returns to its proper place in the library.</p>

<p>The Hearth gained its larger dimensions courtesy of extradimensional magic created by worshipers of Gond (god of craft). An intricate clockwork device is suspended in a two-foot-diameter, faintly glowing crystal orb embedded in the ceiling over the bar. The Avowed call this device a geometric amplifier. It is the source of the magic required to maintain the integrity of the enlarged space.</p>
<p>The bar seats up to twenty customers, and patrons can also be seated comfortably at round tables with stout wooden chairs or at rectangular tables with benches. A dozen soft, cushy armchairs encircle the fireplace in the center of the room.</p>

He&rsquo;s most often found sitting by himself in a corner of the Hearth&rsquo;s taproom, reading a book.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the ogre was like many others of his kindâ€”brutish and cruel. He met a halfling adventurer wearing the shiny gold headband and killed the puny runt for it. When the ogre attuned to it, the headband grew in size, enabling him to wear it. With an improved ability to reason and ponder, the ogre felt compelled to appreciate the error of his ways and seek out a better life. He adopted the name Little One, to honor the halfling whose life he cut short.</p>
<p>Shunned by polite society, Little One came to Candlekeep hoping to learn as much as he could. He&rsquo;s a quiet but popular fixture in the keep, and the Avowed are always saying hello to him and recommending new books for him to read. He is currently reading <em>Storm King&rsquo;s Thunder</em>, by Scriers Phink. This book follows the exploits of a band of adventurers searching for a storm giant king named Hekaton, whose sudden disappearance caused great upheaval up and down the Sword Coast some years ago.</p>
<p>You can use Little One to introduce your player characters to rare books such as the ones described in this adventure anthology. Little One doesn&rsquo;t mind sharing whatever book he is currently enjoying.</p>

<p>In 1492 DR, the exchange is managed by Feldmar Bisset III, a human acolyte of Gond, an expert tailor, and a sericulture hobbyist. He and his family fashioned a place among the Avowed, crafting robes and other garments upon request. Feldmar teaches a compulsory class on simple stitching to adjutants in an effort to reduce the amount of basic patchwork he and his family do to keep the Avowed neatly clothed.</p>

It is fifteen feet tall and made of a translucent dark green stone that glows with an inner light. An <wc-fetch type=spell>arcane lock</wc-fetch> spell seals the door, which is further warded against all damage. Here, a Keeper of the Emerald Door (a mage) stands at all times to welcome newly arrived seekers. The Keeper uses runners to help seekers secure lodgings at the House of Rest and places to study in the Pillars of Pedagogy.</p>
<p>Keepers of the Emerald Door politely dispel any mistaken notions seekers might have about passing through the Emerald Door and exploring the Great Library beyond. The Inner Ward is off limits to seekers without special dispensation, which must come from the Keeper of Tomes, the First Reader, or one of the eight Great Readers. When permission to enter the Inner Ward is granted by such an individual, it&rsquo;s customary for the beneficiary of this consent to receive a signed and sealed letter of admittance. The wax seal must be intact and unbroken when the letter is presented to the Keeper of the Emerald Door. The Keeper determines the letter&rsquo;s authenticity by opening and reading it. If the letter passes muster, the Keeper returns it, opens the Emerald Door, and allows the letter&rsquo;s owner to enter the Inner Ward. Unless a shorter or longer duration is specified in the letter, permission to occupy the Inner Ward lasts for a tenday, during which time the letter&rsquo;s recipient can come and go as they please.</p>
<p>A Keeper can spot a forged letter of admittance with a successful Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check contested by the forger&rsquo;s Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check. Anyone caught presenting a forged letter is denied access to the Inner Ward indefinitely.</p>
<p>A seeker who is denied entry to the Inner Ward can still enjoy the bulk of Candlekeep&rsquo;s collected works. The seeker need only ask an Avowed adjutant to fetch the desired works and deliver them to the seeker&rsquo;s preferred place of study in Candlekeep (usually a chamber in the Pillars of Pedagogy). Not all books in the collection can be checked out in this manner, however; the rarest and most dangerous tomes can be accessed only by creatures who are granted passage through the Emerald Door.</p>
<p>If a request is made for a work that has been checked out by another Candlekeep resident, it could be days or weeks before that work becomes available.</p>

<p>Non-Avowed rarely enter the Great Library, but senior staff members occasionally bestow letters of admittance upon individuals of remarkable talent and impeccable reputation (including adventurers). These visitors may peruse the contents within, with an Avowed adjutant (a commoner) serving as their guide.

<p>The oldest of the library&rsquo;s buildings are soaring stone affairs with floors crafted from lustrous dark wood and floor-to-ceiling shelves.

From the citadel&rsquo;s stone battlements, one can see over the walls of Candlekeep in every direction.</p>
<p>The Avowed live in Exaltation, and visitors are not welcome here unless they&rsquo;ve made an extraordinary donation or performed a special favor for the Avowed, in which case they&rsquo;re allowed a room and given strict instructions not to wander the halls without their assigned guides.</p>
<p>The halls of Exaltation connect to its classrooms, kitchens, bakeries, dining halls, shrines, workshops, offices, study halls, scriptoriums, and dormitories.</p>
<p>Bells rung at dawn mark the beginning of everyone&rsquo;s daily routine, and bells rung at highsun and sundown signal the serving of lunch and dinner. These bells also denote the changing of the guard at the eastern gatehouse and the Emerald Door.</p>

The flooded caves at sea level are haunted by all manner of strange creatures.</p>

She devoured scholars and destroyed a score of irreplaceable books before she was confronted by an archmage and bound into service to protect Candlekeep as penance for her misdeeds. The wizard passed away before Miirym&rsquo;s sentence had been served, and other spellcasters were unable to break the enchantment that bound her.</p>
<p>Time passed and so did Miirym, whose corpse has long since crumbled into dust. Unfortunately for Miirym, the enchantment remains in effect on her spirit. The spectral dragonâ€”what&rsquo;s left of herâ€”dwells in the catacombs and caves under the library. Those who have visited the depths describe Miirym as a set of immense spectral jaws whose essence roils with the promise of breath weapons and spells of destruction.</p>
<p>Adventurers who explore the passages beneath Candlekeep might encounter Miirym, who&rsquo;s more interested in news of present-day FaerÃ»n than in fighting. Indeed, Miirym is an engaging conversationalist if one has the inclination to chat with her.</p>
<p>Miirym doesn&rsquo;t have a treasure hoard. Instead, she protects the books and scrolls kept in her subterranean domain. The Sentinel Wyrm can be summoned by the Keeper of Tomes and called upon to defend Candlekeep from invaders who would plunder or destroy it. In her role as Candlekeep&rsquo;s defender, Miirym can move anywhere within the library fortress, passing through walls and other solid barriers. She can&rsquo;t enter extradimensional spaces, since they are not on the same plane of existence as Candlekeep. Miirym&rsquo;s stat block appears at the end of this section.</p>

Only the First Reader and the Keeper of Tomes have the ability to coax audible recordings from these magic gemstones. Each one holds a prophecy spoken by Alaundo himself in an antiquated version of Common that is incomprehensible without the aid of magic. These gemstones came to be called the echoes of Alaundo.</p>
<p>Alaundo&rsquo;s prophecies are easily misinterpreted, which is why First Readers and Keepers of Tomes rarely consult or take advantage of the echoes.</p>

Here, one can gain the power to contact the spirits of long-dead sages that are willing to share their insights and knowledge. High-ranking members of the Avowed make use of this chamber, but few seekers know of it.</p>
<p>Any creature that has an Intelligence of 8 or higher that spends 1 hour meditating in the chamber gains the ability to cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>contact other plane</wc-fetch> spell once, allowing the creature to commune with a spirit. The spell doesn&rsquo;t need to be cast right away, nor does it need to be cast in the chamber. If the spell is not cast within 24 hours, however, it is lost.</p>
