<p><em>The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces</em> was donated to Candlekeep with the rest of the library of the mage Fistandia, following her untimely disappearance. In her will, Fistandia bequeathed her collection to Candlekeep in appreciation for the many years she spent in its hallowed halls. This book is a treatise on extradimensional spaces similar to those created by the <wc-fetch type=spell>Mordenkainen&rsquo;s magnificent mansion</wc-fetch> spell. This information alone would make it worthy of note, but Fistandia&rsquo;s additions in the margins are even more interesting. In arcane shorthand, she details how she created a permanent <wc-fetch type=spell>Mordenkainen&rsquo;s magnificent mansion</wc-fetch> spell and records the command word to open the mansion&rsquo;s doorway.</p>
<p>Many researchers perused this book over the years it spent in Candlekeep, but knowledge of the command word was useless without the location of the gateway to the mansionâ€”until a chance discovery by the sage Matreous, an expert in the application and removal of curses. Upon arriving at Candlekeep to further his expertise, Matreous cast <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch>, as was his habit. The spell revealed a gateway in the very study room he had been assigned!</p>
<p>Forgetting about his earlier purpose, Matreous asked for any knowledge of who might have created such a gateway. Research by the Avowed revealed that Fistandia requested this room each time she visited the keep. They also turned up mysterious reports that she rarely left the room for weeks at a time. Rumors said that she was not even seen to eat or sleep during her visits. She would, however, go missing for hours at a time. Matreous concluded that she must have gone through the gateway during those absences. By searching through the books Fistandia donated to the library, he found the command word to open the portal and stepped inside.</p>

The settlement has withered this year. Crops have failed, the livestock stands in the fields like stick figures, and the rain has dwindled. A local mage determined that a curse had been levied on the land and recommended that the town seek aid from a sage named Matreous. After some inquiries, the mage found that Matreous was studying in Candlekeep and sent the characters to find him.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the characters could discover <em>The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces</em> while researching one of the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating permanent versions of existing spells</li>
<li>Demiplanes, pocket dimensions, and other spaces that exist outside the Material Plane</li>
</ul>
<p>Tied to <em>The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces</em> are two mysteries. The first is the whereabouts of the missing sage Matreous. The characters can resolve this question by opening the portal to the mansion. The larger mystery, however, is how to escape once they are trapped inside.</p>

Its thick covers are made of ornately tooled leather decorated with gold filigree. Of particular interest is the illustration on the cover: the bust of an imposing spellcaster. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check recognizes the legendary mage Mordenkainen.</p>

Only the sage&rsquo;s personal effects and a handful of books remain. <em>The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces</em> is open to the pages with Fistandia&rsquo;s handwritten notes. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check is able to decipher the shorthand and find the command word, &ldquo;scepter,&rdquo; that opens the doorway. Otherwise, the Avowed are happy to help examine Fistandia&rsquo;s notes.</p>
<p>Once the command word is spoken, shimmering, translucent doors appear in the middle of the room. The doors begin to slowly fade, and it&rsquo;s apparent that they&rsquo;ll disappear entirely in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>When the characters enter the portal, they appear in <strong>area area M1</strong>.</p>

It&rsquo;s luxurious, but not ostentatious. The structure is open, airy, and constructed of stone blocks. The floors are hardwood, and the bedroom, study, trophy room, and dining room have carpets that cover most of the floor space in those rooms. The mansion has brass or bronze fixtures and doors of ironbound oak. The furniture is all of deep brown wood, and most of the rooms are illuminated by oil lamps.</p>
<p>Outside, a swirling indigo miasma hovers 20 feet from the building on all sides. A creature that enters the miasma feels increasingly uneasy during the first minute of exposure. If it remains in the miasma, it gains 1 level of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> for every minute it spends there.</p>

She created seven books, each with a single gilded letter on its spine. When placed next to each other in the proper order, they spell the command word, &ldquo;liberty.&rdquo; The books bear not only the lettered spines but also the same image of Mordenkainen that graces the cover of <em>The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces</em>.</p>

It&rsquo;s not a statue, however, but a real imp that Fistandia summoned and transformed into a statuette. Removing the figurine from the mansion breaks the enchantment and releases the imp.</p>

Rooms with windows to the outside are lit by the indigo miasma swirling outside the mansion, which colors everything in the room with its tint. In the larger rooms it tones down the warm light of the oil lamps.</p>

Foyer and Hallway</h4><p>The characters emerge from the portal in the grand foyer of the mansion. On this side, the portal looks like a double door.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ceiling arches to fifteen feet overhead, and long hallways stretch out on either side of the foyer. Standing in the middle of this area is a middle-aged man wearing gray robes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matreous, a neutral human sage (see the <strong>area stat block</strong>), is startled when the characters appear. After his initial surprise, he introduces himself to the characters and expresses his delight that they have opened the portal to the mansion. He has been trying different command words for the last half hour to get the portal to reopen.</p>
<p>Matreous takes on a thoughtful expression and pauses for an instant, tapping his chin in thought. The mansion must be a treasure trove of information, and there&rsquo;s no telling what wonders it holds! As an example, he shows the characters an intricately carved figurine of an imp that he has found and is taking back to Candlekeep for study.</p>
<p>Matreous explains that he would dearly like to continue to explore the mansion&rsquo;s mysteries himself, but he could be much more useful back in Candlekeep. Thanks to the research he conducted to find the mansion, he has the skills to keep the portal open from the other side. If the characters take this chance to explain their errand to him, he is willing to accompany them back to their village in exchange for their time and efforts exploring the mansion.</p>
<p>If the characters agree to explore the mansion, Matreous steps through the double door leading back to the study room. When he does, the characters hear Matreous shriek as the doors slam shut, locking them inside the mansion. (Matreous lets out the shriek as the imp figurine in his possession reveals its true nature. The characters can&rsquo;t help Matreous until they find a way to reopen the portal.)</p>

<p>This room contains a battered wooden mannequin and a weapon rack holding staffs and daggers, all lit by indigo-tinted light streaming through a window. The floor is stained and scorched. At the far end of the room, a broom hovers in the air, sweeping the floor by itself!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room was where Fistandia practiced her martial and magical skills (at the expense of the fine floors). The mannequin has numerous cuts and chips. The weapons in the rack are mundane but finely made. There are four <wc-fetch type=item>Dagger</wc-fetch>, four <wc-fetch type=item>Quarterstaff</wc-fetch>, and twenty <wc-fetch type=item>Dart</wc-fetch> in a bandolier hanging from one of the pegs. One wall holds diagrams of attack and parry positions for wielders of staffs and daggers.</p>
<p>The broom is an animated broom. If left alone, it goes about its duties cleaning the floors and ignores the characters. If a creature attempts to grab it or menace it in any way, it attacks.</p>

Study</h4><p>The door to this room is left ajar so the cats can come and go as they please.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entire far wall of this room is a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf. Even more books are resting on several large scarlet armchairs and small wooden tables, and there are several paintings on the walls. A fluffy black cat is curled up on one of the chairs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters enter the room, the cat sits up, meows plaintively, and approaches. If they feed it or pet it and make a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) check, it follows them until they leave the study or venture up the stairs, at which time it heads to the kitchen (area M6). If the characters don&rsquo;t pay attention to it, the cat waits for a short time, but then loses interest and leaves for the kitchen.</p>
<p>If the characters spend 30 minutes investigating the books in this room, they discover the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost all the books in this study were written by someone named Fistandia. Most are her memoirs.</li>
<li>Fistandia was a powerful mage as well as a priest of Mystra. She frequented Candlekeep to further her studies.</li>
<li>In exchange for Fistandia&rsquo;s pious service and achievements in expanding the arts of magic, Mystra granted Fistandia a permanent extradimensional mansion for her to reside in when studying in Candlekeep.</li>
<li>Fearful that a guest might become trapped in the mansion, Fistandia hid the command word to open the portal to Candlekeep on the spines of seven books in her mansion.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The aromas of cooking permeate this kitchen. A large iron stove takes up one wall, and the rest of the room is filled with large tables and racks lined with hanging pots, pans, and cooking utensils. Everything is sparkling clean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kitchen is run by two Homunculus named Cumin and Coriander. Most homunculi can&rsquo;t speak, but these ones have the ability to speak Common. When the characters enter the room, the homunculi greet the new arrivals in squeaky voices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a flapping of wings, two small forms land on the nearest table. They bow low before you and ask, &ldquo;How can we be of help to our honored guests? Cooking? Cleaning? Mending your clothes, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The homunculi have had only the cats and the faerie dragons in area M9 to cook for or clean up after for ages, so they practically trip over themselves in their eagerness to provide any service to the characters. They pester the characters for tasks to do and insist on serving them fresh bread and soup.</p>
<p>The duties of the homunculi are confined mostly to the kitchen and the adjoining dining room (<strong>area area M8</strong>). They don&rsquo;t know much about what happens in the rest of the mansion, but they can answer direct questions with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cumin was created by Fistandia, while Coriander says that a mage named Freyot created it.</li>
<li>Their masters went away a long time ago.</li>
<li>They have been warned by their masters not to touch any books that have single letters on their spines. (The homunculi don&rsquo;t know the significance of these lettered books.)</li>
<li>Fistandia used to go into the planetarium (<strong>area area M12</strong>) and disappear for a long time afterward.</li>
<li>Something keeps building piles of books in the library. (The homunculi are unaware of the swarm of animated books in <strong>area area M3</strong>.)</li>
<li>The imp that Fistandia summoned hasn&rsquo;t been seen in some time.</li>
<li>The faerie dragons in the arboretum (<strong>area area M9</strong>) are mischievous but harmless. Try to stay out of their way.</li>

They are mischievous creatures, always looking for fun, but the homunculi and the cats provide little entertainment, so they hope to keep the characters in the arboretum for as long as possible so they can play with them. Giggling incessantly, they fly toward the characters, use their Euphoria Breath, and flit out of danger, still <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch>. If they are attacked, they <wc-fetch type=action>disengage</wc-fetch> and retreat to a safe place, becoming <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> again if their concentration is broken.</p>

<p>The door opens into a dark, open space offering a view of the starry firmament of the night sky. Five telescopes mounted on bronze plates point toward the constellations above. In the middle of the space, a one-foot-diameter sphere of clear crystal sits in a circular brass stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The room is a detailed and convincing illusion of a grassy knoll on a moonless night. Springy turf compresses underfoot, and when the doors to the room are closed, the starry night sky is visible in all directions. Terrain more than 20 feet away at ground level, however, is shadowy and indistinct; only the sky above seems sharp and clear. In fact, the stars shine down with an almost fierce light. Anyone who explores the room discovers that this effect is an illusion and can determine the size and shape of the actual space.</p>
<p>If the characters try to manipulate the telescopes, they find that it&rsquo;s easy to change the orientation of these well-balanced instruments. The telescopes cannot be moved in any other way, however, and are sturdily mounted to their pedestals. The crystal ball is also firmly fixed and cannot be moved.</p>

<p>The three shelves are filled with books bound in iron covers, which are attached to chains that secure them to the shelvesâ€”a chained library. The reading desk is used to support the chained books while they are being read. This chained library has been enchanted to be jealously possessive of its contents. It attacks any creature that comes within its reach (use the accompanying animated chained library stat block).</p>
<p>Fistandia&rsquo;s most treasured knowledge is kept here. There are rare tomes on the sciences, arcana, and alchemy, as well as books about planar lore and the summoning of fantastic creatures. All the books are firmly affixed to the shelves by enchanted chains and can&rsquo;t be freed without being destroyed.</p>

A character who examines the charts and formulas and makes a successful DC 13 Intelligence check determines that the main goal of the research here was to transmute various materials into gold. Judging by the numerous scorch marks and acid burns on the furniture, the laboratory was the scene of several spectacular failures.</p>
<p>Four clay figures rest on a table in the middle of the room. They range from a rudimentary, barely humanoid shape to a small, winged body so lifelike that it almost appears to be a real creature that is merely asleep. A character who makes a successful DC 13 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check can tell that these are figures used for creating homunculi.</p>

Summoning Room</h4><blockquote>
<p>This dark, stone-walled room contains only a few objects. A five-foot-diameter circle of intricate runes covers the floor. There&rsquo;s an empty wooden bookstand opposite the door and bronze braziers at the other three cardinal points of the circle. Whatever material they contained has long ago burned to cinders, but the room still smells of charcoal and sulfur. Sitting next to the bookstand is a warty toad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the room where Fistandia summoned the imp that would become the figurine found by Matreous. The current resident of the room is a quasit in toad form. It waits for a creature to approach and then attacks.</p>

Preserved Menagerie</h4><blockquote>
<p>Smells of alcohol and brine permeate this room. Glass vessels large and small stand in rows on the floor and tables, ranging from one foot to six feet tall. Inside each vessel is the body of a creature floating in clear liquid. One four-foot-tall container is missing its lid and has no occupant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fistandia considered herself to be a knowledgeable natural philosopher, and she collected many rare specimens to study. She kept examples of common and natural creatures in <strong>area area M11</strong>, and rare or aberrant creatures in this room. The collection includes a cockatrice, a flumph, a giant fire beetle, a small grell, a myconid sprout, a pseudodragon, four severed hands in the same jar, and a slaad tadpole that&rsquo;s still alive and attacks if its jar is opened.</p>
<p>The empty container once held the mimic found in <strong>area area M8</strong>. Gravely injured when it was captured, it feigned death until it could recover and escape into the upper levels of the mansion.</p>
<p>The four severed hands have absorbed enough magical energy to become Crawling Claw. They push the lid off their jar and attack when any creature comes within 5 feet of them.</p>

<p>Once the characters have recovered all (or most of) the lettered books, they should be able to guess the command word. When it is spoken, a pulse of power ripples through the mansion as the double door in <strong>area area M1</strong> swings open, forming a portal that leads back to the study room in Candlekeep. The doorway remains open only for a minute, but the characters can simply speak the command word to reveal it again.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>
<a href=#conclusion class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Conclusion</h2><p>When the characters return to the study room in Candlekeep, they find Matreous&rsquo;s body sprawled on the floor and the imp figurine missing. When the imp was taken from the mansion in its figurine form, the enchantment binding it ended, allowing it to sting and kill Matreous. The imp is now <wc-fetch type=condition>invisible</wc-fetch> and hiding in a corner of Matreous&rsquo;s study. It attacks the first creature that exits the mansion. If the characters defeat the imp, it disappears in a cloud of black smoke.</p>
<p>Any treasure, books, specimens, or weapons the characters acquired while in the mansion remain in their possession. Anything else taken from the mansion evaporates into smoke as they pass through the doorway.</p>

If they&rsquo;re willing to spend more time in Candlekeep, they might be able to find another sage who possesses the expertise they require. Alternatively, they might need to undertake new quests to earn enough money to have Matreous raised from the dead.</p>
<p>Fistandia and her wizardly colleague Freyot are alive, as evidenced by the homunculi they left behind in Fistandia&rsquo;s mansion. What are these two wizards up to, and where are they now? One or both of them might return to Fistandia&rsquo;s mansion some day. If the characters are using the mansion as a place to rest, how will Fistandia and Freyot react to the presence of uninvited guests in their home? These questions are left for you to answer.</p>
