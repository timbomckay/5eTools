<p>In this adventure, the player characters investigate the disappearance of a Candlekeep sage and disrupt the plans of a mad oracle bent on domination.</p>
<p>_The Canopic Being_arrived at Candlekeep nine months ago, wrapped in yellow cloth embroidered with the image of an eye. It was delivered with a handwritten note reading, &ldquo;As fate wills it,&rdquo; signed by Xemru Thaal, a high priest of Savras, god of divination and fate. As preservers of the teachings of Alaundo the Seer, the Avowed of Candlekeep were keen to study what they expected to be a book exploring the divinatory arts. When its horrific contents were revealed, _The Canopic Being_was relocated to the library&rsquo;s vaults, where it currently resides.</p>
<p>The book is the record of a ritual that allows the transplanting of a mummy lord&rsquo;s organs into living vessels to forge a dark connection between donor and recipient. The end of the book contains a list of those recipientsâ€”which includes the names of all the characters.</p>

The characters can be in Candlekeep already doing research of their own, or they might be summoned there if they are known to the library and its scholars.</p>
<p>Read or paraphrase the following when you&rsquo;re ready to begin the adventure, replacing Great Reader A&rsquo;lai Aivenmore with another scholar of the characters' acquaintance if you so choose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A&rsquo;lai Aivenmore&rsquo;s mood is dark as they pace before you. &ldquo;Mayastan Sadaar, one of our finest sages, had been studying a particular tome, held in the vaults.&rdquo; So saying, A&rsquo;lai gestures to a book on a cluttered desk whose cover appears to be of made translucent crystal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A&rsquo;lai describes the book as a treatise on dark rituals and tells how it arrived at Candlekeep as a donation from a high priest of Savras. She talks of how Mayastan came to her, clearly bothered by something she had read in <em>The Canopic Being</em>, and saying that she wanted to continue her research with the help of the oracle of the House of the All-Seeing Orb in Tashalar, east of Chult. Mayastan went there by way of teleportation. Shortly after Mayastan left, A&rsquo;lai consulted the tome, hoping to gain some sense of what was troubling the sage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A&rsquo;lai pushes the book toward you, opening it to a page near to the end that is filled with a list of names in a half-dozen different hands. Across the top of the page in the rushed script that fills the rest of the book is written the legend: &ldquo;Those Who Have Been Bestowedâ€”The Willing Sacrifices.&rdquo; At the bottom of the page is Mayastan Sadaar&rsquo;s nameâ€”followed by the names of each of you.</p>
</blockquote>

Every so often, the eyes move, shifting their gaze between different locations. The book&rsquo;s pages are edged in a protective crystalline finish and filled with a hurried, nearly illegible scrawl. Xemru Thaal&rsquo;s note (see the accompanying <strong>area player handout</strong>) still accompanies the book and is tucked in an envelope that bears the seal of the House of the All-Seeing Orb, a temple of Savras in Tashluta, the capital city of Tashalar.</p>
<p>The book describes rituals relating to the creation of a mummy lord. One is a unique and horrific process by which a mummy lord&rsquo;s organs, normally stored in sacred canopic jars during mummification, can be magically preserved and transplanted into living humanoids. The transplant recipients come under the control of the mummy lord, either as living supplicants or mindless golems through which the mummy lord can see and speak. The book also hints of a ritual that can free a servant after the mummy lord is destroyed.</p>
<p>The last page of the book appears to be a list of those who have undergone this rite to become a mummy lord&rsquo;s servantsâ€”but it also includes the names of the missing Candlekeep sage and of the characters.</p>

Valin Sarnaster is an honored oracle of Savras, based in the House of the All-Seeing Orb in Tashalar. In accordance with visions she experienced years before, the oracle has embraced undeath by becoming a mummy lord, using the rituals described in the book. The list of names in the back of the book is written by many hands, since it includes creatures bonded to other mummy lords before the tome came to Valin. The names Valin has added at the end are those of the oracle&rsquo;s current and intended victims, as seen in her visions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alessia Baseer, Valin Sarnaster&rsquo;s longtime attendant (and the unwitting custodian of Valin&rsquo;s heart)</li>
<li>Xemru Thaal, the high priest who sent the book to Candlekeep (now a golem serving Valin)</li>
<li>Zeren Zoradius, a human mage (who now serves Valin as a golem)</li>
<li>Okuzor, a tiefling gladiator (and another of Valin&rsquo;s golem servants)</li>
<li>Mayastan Sadaar, the dragonborn sage</li>
<li>Each of the characters, using whatever names they are best known by</li>
</ul>

It is my honor to have been selected as the first donor and recipient. By giving Valin a piece of myself and receiving a piece of her in return, I can help the fate of the world unfold as she has foreseen.</p>
<p>It is my honor to protect the oracle in her sanctuary, ensuring that only donors and recipients may visit her. I have no need of the rite of reclamation, for I believe in the vision and perfection of Valin Sarnaster.</p>
<p>For clarity&rsquo;s sake, I offer this record of the procedures performed on the donors and recipients, whose fates and organs are now bound to the oracle. May she serve the All-Seeing for centuries to come.</p>
<p>In transparency,</p>
<p>Xemru Thaal, High Priest of Savras</p>
<p>House of the All-Seeing Orb, Tashluta</p>

The First Reader has no proof that Mayastan is in danger, but the implications of her name appearing in <em>The Canopic Being</em> are alarming. A&rsquo;lai expects that the characters have their own reasons to investigate, having seen their names in the book. If they need further incentive, she offers the party 5,000 gp or the future services of Candlekeep to undertake the mission.</p>
<p>Mages at Candlekeep can set up the characters' journey by casting the <wc-fetch type=spell>teleportation circle</wc-fetch> spell to reach a permanent teleportation circle at the House of the All-Seeing Orb. This is the same destination to which Mayastan Sadaar traveled the previous day.</p>

It is a welcoming stopover point for travelers, merchants, and traders in the south. Tashalar is a land known for warm, breezy weather, bright, flowing garments, and spicy, delicious foods. It is also famous for the obsession its citizens have for divining the future; most Tashlutans claim to have some amount of skill with personal prognostication.</p>
<p>One of the most notable sights in Tashluta, the House of the All-Seeing Orb is an immense compound dedicated to the study of magical divination. Clerics, mages, and other scholars work at the institution&rsquo;s Celestial Observatory, its Library of Ultimate Truth, and its College of Divination.</p>
<p>When the characters arrive at the temple, read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The teleportation circle is surrounded by a courtyard garden and several buildings. The day is warm, with a mild breeze. Yellow-robed sages and priests, some carrying tomes or mysterious-looking magic devices, bustle about the immense compound. The largest building is patterned with inscribed eyes. A larger, more detailed eye is carved above the building&rsquo;s main doorway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The large building is the compound&rsquo;s main temple, home to the priests and oracles of Savras. Despite its elaborate exterior, the interior of the temple is simple, containing only an altar, modest living quarters, a kitchen, and a dining area. The building&rsquo;s only noteworthy feature is its reflecting pool, which is filled with holy water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several priests are present in the temple, all with a third eye tattooed on their foreheads, and all wearing simple yellow robes belted at the waist with a sash. Many carry elaborately carved and decorated staffs. Some are at work sweeping or scrubbing the temple&rsquo;s floors, while others gaze into scrying bowls or scrutinize tea leaves.</p>
<p>The priest who sits at the largest table has her tattooed eye decorated with gemstones. Her dark green hair is close-cropped, with a mark shaved into it that matches a sigil on her cherrywood staff. She looks up toward you as she pours from a steaming pot of tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More visitors from Candlekeep. Most delightful. I trust that your journey was not too taxing?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure with the bejeweled third eye is Shir Endellion (a lawful neutral human priest), currently the highest-ranking official in the temple. While engaged in her divinatory studies a tenday ago, she foresaw the arrival of both Mayastan Sadaar and the party, but she does not know the purpose of the characters' visit.</p>
<p>If the characters join her, Shir offers them tea, then calls for fine Tashlutan wine, pastries, and other finger foods to be delivered to the table. The priest knows the following information, which she is happy to share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayastan arrived yesterday, intending to speak with the oracle Valin Sarnaster. The sage was taken to Valin&rsquo;s sanctum and has not returned.</li>
<li>Valin Sarnaster is known to all who serve Savras, and her works have long been an inspiration. She has lived alone for decades now, so that the influence of the outside world will have no effect on her divinatory abilities.</li>
<li>If <em>The Canopic Being</em> is discussed, Shir doesn&rsquo;t recognize the name of the book. If its contents are described, she is horrified, but she says that the dark rituals the book describes have nothing to do with Savras&rsquo;s work. If she is told that Xemru Thaal sent the book to Candlekeep nine months ago, she has no idea why that happened.</li>
<li>If the characters ask to see Xemru, Shir says that the high priest went through the portal to visit Valin eight months ago and has not come back. Messages received from him through Valin&rsquo;s attendant, Alessia, say that he continues to study with Valin and plans to remain with her for the foreseeable future. (Xemru accepted the future in which he saw himself becoming Valin&rsquo;s servant. But a sense of misgiving caused him to send <em>The Canopic Being</em> to Candlekeep as evidence of what Valin had becomeâ€”as Valin had already foreseen.)</li>
<li>Valin lives in a secret sanctum, since she would otherwise be sought out by too many people seeking her wisdom and counsel. A portal hidden in the temple complex is the only means of reaching her. The oracle sends her attendant, Alessia, through the portal regularly to convey and receive messages.</li>
<li>Three other people have traveled through the portal to seek Valin&rsquo;s guidance within the past three months: Zeren Zoradius, a human mage; Okuzor, a tiefling gladiator; and Mayastan Sadaar, the Candlekeep sage. As with Xemru Thaal, none of the other visitors have yet returned.</li>

The shed is quietly watched at all hours by faithful acolytes, and an <wc-fetch type=spell>alarm</wc-fetch> spell regularly cast on the door by the temple&rsquo;s mages sounds out if the door is opened by anyone except Shir Endellion or Alessia Baseer (see <strong>area area T1</strong> of Valin&rsquo;s tomb). Shir and Alessia carry keys that can unlock the door from inside or outside. The door can also be unlocked with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>The shed holds unused gardening equipment and has a hidden trapdoor that can be found with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check if not revealed by Shir. Below the trapdoor is a 5-foot-diameter stone-walled well with a sturdy wooden ladder. The well descends 20 feet before opening up into a 40-foot-square chamber whose walls and floor are worked stone. The portal that leads to Valin&rsquo;s sanctum is on the wall opposite the well&rsquo;s ladder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The plain gray stone of the wall diffuses into a swirling ellipsoid of blue-and-white light, edged by translucent crystals. From across the room, the portal resembles an enormous eye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This portal is a permanent magical effect set up by Valin Sarnaster. It connects to the crystalline demiplane that serves as the mummy lord&rsquo;s tomb.</p>

The particulars of that future and the oracle&rsquo;s interest in the characters is left to your determination.</p>
<p>Valin has long plotted to usurp the role of Savras, acquiring power through her dark rituals that will enable her to become a new demigod of fate. In her visions, she has seen that the characters will thwart her plansâ€”so she has arranged the events that cause them to come to her, so she can end their threat before it begins. In the course of their fight to expose and destroy Valin, the characters might gain glimpses of the future or hear coded threats from her about the fate she sees for them. Especially if your campaign is built around an epic story line, these oracular insights can help you foreshadow what&rsquo;s to come.</p>

The site was once a temple and was long abandoned until the oracle&rsquo;s magic rediscovered it. It is filled with the signs and symbols of Savras, but whether it was built as a temple to the god or whether it was constructed by Savras when he was still a mortal, not even Valin has been able to determine.</p>
<p>The former temple is built entirely of clear, sparkling crystal. Though the complex has its own gravity and is not fully transparent, moving through it can sometimes create the unsettling sense of floating in space.</p>
<p>Characters who look outside the temple see the demiplane beyond as a shifting space of glowing crystals. The demiplane does not enter into the adventure, and its full details are left to your determination.</p>

<p><strong>Rite of Reclamation:</strong> A ritual known as the rite of reclamation involves claiming some of the dust of Valin&rsquo;s body after she has been reduced to 0 hit points. The ritual describes a process for mixing the dust with wax to create a magic candle, then floating the lit candle in a vessel of holy water. If a creature imbued with one of Valin&rsquo;s organs spends an entire long rest within 5 feet of the candle, the candle is consumed, Valin&rsquo;s organ is destroyed, and the creature&rsquo;s missing organ is restored. The rite of reclamation is known to Valin and detailed on a scroll found in <strong>area area T5</strong>. The characters might also be able to learn the ritual through research or a side quest.</p>
<p><strong>Replacing What&rsquo;s Lost:</strong> A more direct restoration can be undertaken if the creature imbued with one of Valin&rsquo;s organs has been killed and the characters have access to the creature&rsquo;s original organ. Removing Valin&rsquo;s organ from the creature&rsquo;s body reveals it to be shriveled, glassy, and pulsing with unnatural life. If the creature&rsquo;s original organ is replaced within 1 hour of its death at the same time Valin&rsquo;s organ is destroyed, the creature returns to life immediately as if targeted by a <wc-fetch type=spell>resurrection</wc-fetch> spell. A character who removes one of Valin&rsquo;s organs from a dead host creature and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch>) check intuits how this process works.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Walls and Floors.</b> The crystal from which the temple was constructed glows with a bright light that fills all areas, even as it allows the characters faint glimpses of what lies beyond it. The magic of the walls obscures certain features, however, so that secret passages and rooms can&rsquo;t be seen from outside them. The crystal that makes up the tomb can&rsquo;t be damaged by any means available to the characters.</li>
<li><b>Ceilings.</b> Hallways and smaller chambers in the tomb are 15 feet high with flat ceilings. The ceilings in larger chambers are 20 to 30 feet high.</li>
<li><b>Doors.</b> All doors in the tomb are made of crystal, and most of them are unlocked. A character can use an action to try to open a locked door, either by using thieves' tools and succeeding on a DC 20 Dexterity check, or by forcing open the door with a successful DC 25 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A door has AC 15, 60 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</li>
<li><b>Eyes of Savras.</b> The walls of the tomb are adorned with decorative eyes that serve as magical sensors, following the movements of visitors who explore the site. Valin Sarnaster controls the eyes, which have <wc-fetch type=sense>truesight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 120 feet and allow her to surveil the characters from anywhere in the tomb. She must maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) to do so. The eyes are free-floating in <strong>area area T9</strong> and are prevented from functioning in <strong>area area T3</strong>.</li>
<li><b>Extradimensional Interference.</b> The tomb is warded against teleportation, and creatures inside it can&rsquo;t travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.</li>

Portal</h4><p>The portal beneath the House of the All-Seeing Orb brings the characters to this location. The portal is not affected by the wards against teleportation magic that fill the tomb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stepping through the portal brings you into the center of a square room, its walls, floor, and ceiling made of glowing crystal set with images of unblinking eyes. A crystal door stands closed, but you can just make out the long corridor beyond it, and a lone, yellow-robed priest of Savras waiting for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the characters move around in the room, the eyes in the walls turn to follow them.</p>
<p>The guard is Alessia Baseer, a lawful good human priest of Savras (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Alessia Baseer</strong>&rdquo; sidebar). A premonition of someone arriving through the portal brought her here to await the characters. When she sees them, she assumes they have been summoned by or have important business with Valin, and she freely answers any questions put to her.</p>

If the idea that Valin might be a mummy lord is mentioned, Alessia confirms that she sees the oracle regularly and that Valin appears quite normal. (This is a product of the mummy lord&rsquo;s diadem, which functions as a <wc-fetch type=item>hat of disguise</wc-fetch>.)</p>
<p>Having escorted all the recent visitors to the temple, Alessia is under the impression that they are communing with Valin in the observatory of fate (<strong>area area T9</strong>). She explains that time passes differently in the observatory, making it not unusual that those visitors have apparently been gone from the world for months. (This is a lie told to her by Valin.) She thus does not understand that the canopic golems have been created from Valin&rsquo;s visitors. She has not been through <strong>area area T7</strong> in a few days, and so likewise does not know Mayastan Sadaar&rsquo;s fate.</p>

She tells the characters that they have free run of the temple, and that they will find Valin when fate determines it. She does warn them against the dangers they might face in certain areas, including the mirrors of fortune (<strong>area area T3</strong>), the testing chamber (<strong>area area T4</strong>), and the phasing passage (<strong>area area T7</strong>). She also knows why the sword hilt has been hidden in the dais in area T4, but does not share that information until Valin&rsquo;s true nature is revealed to her.</p>
<p>With suitable roleplaying or a successful DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check, Alessia agrees to escort the characters through area T3, but then returns to her quarters (<strong>area area T2</strong>).</p>
<p>Alessia keeps the key to her quarters and the key to the portal door on a leather thong around her neck.</p>

<p>This room is furnished with a simple cot, a small footlocker, a round table and chair, and a wooden cupboard with one door ajar. Small figurines of cats set along the top of the cupboard are the room&rsquo;s only decoration. A folding screen obscures the far corner of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alessia&rsquo;s collection of cat figurines include sculptures made of glass, ceramic, and wood. She has collected them since childhood, though they are not valuable. The footlocker holds the attendant&rsquo;s modest personal effects, including a stuffed cat with green button eyes and a bracelet with five charms. One of those charms is the key that unlocks the door to the antechamber (<strong>area area T8</strong>).</p>

It generates food and drink for Alessia and any visitors to the tomb. It currently contains empty glass flasks, half a loaf of bread, and three peaches.</p>
<p>If the cabinet door is closed, a bell rings. When the door is reopened, the previous contents are gone and the cabinet&rsquo;s shelves are filled with foodstuffsâ€”fresh bread, dried meat, flasks of clear water, fruit, sweet cakes, and more.

She is dressed in the simple yellow robes, belted sash, and leather sandals of the priesthood of Savras, and bears the customary third-eye tattoo on her forehead.</p>
<p>Naive curiosity paired with a lack of conversational practice makes Alessia honest to a fault. She remains unaware of Valin&rsquo;s evil natureâ€”and of the fact that she is the living canopic vessel for Valin&rsquo;s heart. Alessia&rsquo;s own heart was removed three years ago as part of the unique ritual described in <em>The Canopic Being</em>. The magic of the ritual allows her to remember being involved in a ceremony that bound her to Valin&rsquo;s service, but she recalls no details of the transfer. The ritual likewise leaves no physical signs behind.</p>

Mirrors of Fortune</h4><blockquote>
<p>The crystal floor, walls, and ceiling of this room are obscured by hanging mirrors whose brightness intensifies as they catch your reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chamber was once used by the priests of the temple for meditation, and its magic is still intact. Two-sided mirrors set along the outside walls of this area reflect everything inside and outside it, causing the area to appear empty from the outside. From the inside, the mirrors block the eyes of Savras, preventing Valin from looking within.</p>
<p>The magic mirrors that cover this area and hang as freestanding walls inside it show a super-realistic reflection of everything in the room, including the other mirrorsâ€”quickly creating a confusing cascade of images. Any creature that enters the area and can see normally is overwhelmed by multiple visions of itself. Each creature that passes through this area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or accidentally make contact with a mirror. A creature that makes contact with a mirror for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in contact with one takes 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) psychic damage.</p>
<p>A creature that passes through the area without taking damage earns a gift of supernatural insight that lasts until it finishes a long rest. While it has this gift, the creature can roll a <wc-roll>d8</wc-roll> and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> before deciding to use the number, but it must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. A creature can&rsquo;t gain this gift again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
<p>Creatures that have <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=sense>truesight</wc-fetch> can move through the area normally, as can Alessia. If the attendant leads the characters through the area, she tells them to follow her closely, and doing so grants them advantage on their saving throws.</p>

Testing Chamber</h4><blockquote>
<p>The wide corridor you are following leads into a huge square chamber whose only feature is a large crystalline dais at its center.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This area was once used by priests and acolytes to sharpen their mental acuity against harmful psychic energy. Valin has turned it into a formidable hiding place for a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>As soon as any character enters this area, they feel a sudden pulse of psychic energy radiating from the dais, which can&rsquo;t be sensed from the corridors beyond. The effect of this numbing energy causes any creature in the room to suffer visible tremors and have its speed halved.</p>
<p>A creature that has a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 18 or higher, or that succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check made to observe the dais, spots an ornate sword hilt embedded within it (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). The hilt can be noted automatically by anyone within 5 feet of the dais.</p>
<h5 id=genie-guardians>
<a href=#genie-guardians class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Genie Guardians</h5><p>Obtaining the hilt requires smashing through the dais, which has AC 18, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the dais is attacked or touched by any creature, two dao wearing bejeweled necklaces are conjured above it and immediately attack any creatures in the room.</p>
<p>On their first turn in combat, the genies target intruders with their <wc-fetch type=spell>phantasmal killer</wc-fetch> spells, maintaining concentration on these spells for as long as possible while attacking with their mauls on later turns. When a dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder. A slain dao leaves behind its maul and its necklace (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>
<p>The dao do not pursue creatures that leave the room. If the characters all leave the area, any dao that wasn&rsquo;t defeated vanishes after 1 minute but returns with full hit points if the dais is touched again.</p>

<a href=#shattered-dais class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Shattered Dais</h5><p>The hilt (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below) can be easily claimed once the dais is destroyed. The first creature to pick it up must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw, taking 14 (<wc-roll>4d6</wc-roll>) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A character wearing gloves or other protection has advantage on the saving throw.</p>
<p>The shattered dais repairs itself 1 hour after being destroyed. If the hilt (or any other object) is left amid the rubble, it is trapped inside the dais when it re-forms. The dais can&rsquo;t re-form around creatures and can&rsquo;t repair itself while one or more creatures occupy its space.</p>
<p>A character who studies the rubble of the shattered dais and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check determines that its original function was allowing acolytes to focus their divinations in the presence of low levels of psychic energy, and that its power has now been corrupted.</p>

It came into her possession years before, after she had received two visions about itâ€”one in which she used the weapon to slay a great enemy, and one in which it was used to slay her. Not willing to destroy the weapon for fear of thwarting the first vision, she has kept the hilt hidden in an attempt to keep the second vision from coming to pass.</p>
<p>Each dao wears a golden, gem-encrusted necklace worth 2,500 gp.</p>

Scrying Pool</h4><p>This chamber was once used to conduct scrying training and rituals, but it has been desecrated by Valin&rsquo;s corruption, as can be confirmed by a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect evil and good</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dark swirls of noxious steam fill this circular chamber, whose floor is taken up mostly by a large reflecting pool. Runes carved into the pool&rsquo;s rim glow faintly, and heat shimmers off its fetid water. On the far side of the pool&rsquo;s edge, a figure moves, its two bright ochre eyes piercing the fog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okuzor, a tiefling gladiator, sought out Valin expecting to persuade the oracle to offer up predictions for Okuzor&rsquo;s success in the arena. Instead, Valin enticed Okuzor into undergoing the ritual that transferred Valin&rsquo;s eye into the gladiator and turned her into a canopic golem (see the accompanying stat block).</p>
<p>Valin Sarnaster controls Okuzor and uses her to interact with the characters. The oracle speaks through the golem, greeting the characters warmly and asking why they&rsquo;ve come to the temple. She describes the golem as one of her servants, and responds to any talk of her illicit activities by saying that such rumors were no doubt started by enemies of the House of the All-Seeing Orb. She offers to have her golem servant escort the characters to her location if they seek an audience. Okuzor then leads the characters to the false tomb in <strong>area area T6</strong>, where she and the other two canopic golems there attack at once.</p>
<p>If the characters attack Okuzor, the golem fights until reduced to 30 hit points or fewer. She then tries to flee to <strong>area area T6</strong>, hoping to draw the characters to the false tomb and the other golems waiting there.</p>

<p>A character can spend 1 minute trying to undo the corruption of the runes, doing so with a successful DC 19 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check. If this occurs, the noxious smell dissipates as the water cools and reverts to holy water over the course of 1 hour.</p>

<p>The golems attack intruders at once, while Valin speaks through them to challenge the characters. She arrogantly proclaims that no one will ever break through her sarcophagus to face her, hoping to entice the characters to approach the magically warded sarcophagus at the bottom of the pit.</p>

<p>The other three jars are empty. At your discretion, you can have the empty jars scribed with symbols representing three of the characters, as if Valin has prepared those vessels for sacrifices to come. The jars can be easily shattered, but the organs inside (with the exception of Mayastan Sadaar&rsquo;s) can&rsquo;t be destroyed as long as the matching organ from Valin remains in its host.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the bottom of the pit is a dais resembling an enormous eye peering up. A ten-foot-long black onyx sarcophagus forms the pupil of the eye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valin placed her sarcophagus at the bottom of the pit not for security, but as a deadly trap. The sarcophagus is presently empty. Valin returns to it only if she is slain and re-forms, and uses the <wc-fetch type=spell>dimension door</wc-fetch> spell to leave it afterward.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus radiates auras of abjuration and evocation magic to a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell. Its first ward triggers when any creature that is not a construct or an undead moves within 20 feet of it, filling the area of the well to a height of 30 feet above the floor with a noxious gray fog equivalent to the effect of a <wc-fetch type=spell>stinking cloud</wc-fetch> spell. The vapors vanish after 1 minute, and this ward resets after 1 hour.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus&rsquo;s lid weighs 550 pounds. When opened, the sarcophagus vents a blast of stale air and triggers its second magical warding. Each creature within 5 feet of the sarcophagus that is not a construct or an undead must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, taking 27 (<wc-roll>6d8</wc-roll>) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This ward resets when the lid of the sarcophagus is closed again.</p>

Meditation Room</h4><blockquote>
<p>The ceiling of this room is supported by four crystal columns with eye-shaped capstones. A dozen thick cushions are scattered around the room, in the center of which a dragonborn lies in a pool of dried blood on the floor. A dagger and an oblong rock broken into two pieces lie near the body&rsquo;s outstretched arms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fallen figure is Mayastan Sadaar, the scholar who came to the temple to confront Valin, and who became another unwilling recipient of the mummy lord&rsquo;s rituals. Though she remembered nothing of the ritual, Mayastan&rsquo;s recollection of her mission and what she had read in <em>The Canopic Being</em> allowed her to successfully guess what had happened to her. She thus chose to end her life by carving out Valin&rsquo;s pancreas from where it had been placed in her and destroying it, rather than submit to the oracle&rsquo;s dark will.</p>
<p>Turning the body over reveals the horrible abdominal wound that killed Mayastan. Any character who has proficiency in the Medicine skill, or who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch>) check, recognizes that the shape of the rock resembles a pancreas, which shows signs of being hacked nearly in half before it petrified. A character who has proficiency in the <wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch> skill and examines the wound notes that the body&rsquo;s pancreas is missing.</p>
<p>If the characters need information on how to permanently slay a mummy lord, any search of Mayastan&rsquo;s body reveals a sheaf of papers in an inside pocket. These are pages copied from a tome of lore regarding mummy lords, and they note the fact that a mummy lord&rsquo;s heart must be destroyed to keep the mummy lord from re-forming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The walls of this room converge in a high peak overhead. Through the wall opposite the door, the room beyond can be vaguely seenâ€”a vast, cubic chamber filled with shimmering points of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who has a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 18 or higher, or who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check to scan the interior of the chamber beyond this one, notices a strange motion within.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The points of light in the chamber beyond are shifting slowly, like dust motes stirred by a gentle breeze. At the center of the haze of light, a flash of yellow marks the presence of a figure clad in the robes of the faithful of Savras. The figure circles slowly at the apex of the room, motes of light swirling behind it.</p>

Having watched the characters progress through her lair, the mummy lord (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Valin Sarnaster</strong>&rdquo; sidebar for changes to her statistics and roleplaying notes) is fully prepared to face them for a final showdownâ€”but the characters might find fighting in this strange environment to be a challenge.</p>

A zero-gravity effect in this chamber grants any creature a flying speed equal to its walking speed while in the area, but it might take a bit of practice for characters to get used to the effect. A creature that starts its turn in this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity check. On a failed check, the creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes on its turn. On a successful check, the character has become acclimated to the local gravity and does not need to make checks on subsequent turns.</p>

<p>Valin challenges the characters, saying that she has already seen their defeat written in their past and future. As you like, she can share key details from your campaign&rsquo;s past to indicate that she has been watching the charactersâ€”and might even reveal secrets that the characters have yet to figure out. She can also offer visions of futures that might have been before the characters fell into her trap. You can have the oracle describe a key encounter or challenge you expect to play a part in your campaign&rsquo;s future, or use the Consider the Ideal Climax; Adventure Climax in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide to come up with an idea you can then direct the campaign toward.</p>

Hovering in the middle of the room are three objects: a six-foot-long staff made of transparent crystal, a shiny steel helm embossed with lidless eyes, and a tiny blue rhomboid about the size of a piece of candy.</p>

<p>The objects hovering in the middle of the room cease to float as soon as they are grasped. The blue rhomboid is an <wc-fetch type=item>Ioun Stone, Awareness</wc-fetch>. The crystal staff is a <wc-fetch type=item>staff of fate</wc-fetch>, and the embossed steel helm is a <wc-fetch type=item>watchful helm</wc-fetch> (see the &ldquo;<strong>area New Magic Items</strong>&rdquo; section for descriptions of these two items).</p>

Observatory of History</h4><blockquote>
<p>The shell of this large, spherical chamber begins to shimmer with color, forming patterns and images.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creatures that enter this area feel their feet begin to lift gently off the floor. As in <strong>area area T9</strong>, a zero-gravity effect grants any creature a flying speed equal to its walking speed while in this chamber. Because there is no combat in this area, characters do not need to worry about acclimating to the unusual gravity.</p>

But any creature that remains in this area for 1 minute feels their mind open up as the room establishes a connection with them.</p>
<p>As an action, a character can use the room to replay up to 10 minutes of any past event they are aware of, whether personal or historical. The event plays back in perfect detail along the wall of the chamber for all to see and hear. When the vision ends, the character must make a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains the following flaw, which lasts until removed with a <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic: &ldquo;I obsess about the past, and I&rsquo;m constantly trying to go back to undo my mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<a href=#destroying-valin class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Destroying Valin</h3><p>Valin Sarnaster is permanently destroyed only if the characters reduce her to 0 hit points and also destroy her heart before she re-forms. Once Valin is destroyed, the priests of the House of the All-Seeing Orb can convert the tomb back into the temple it once was. If the characters can&rsquo;t find Valin&rsquo;s heart, spells such as <wc-fetch type=spell>commune</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=spell>divination</wc-fetch> can lead them to the truth about Alessia Baseer.</p>

If the characters are still in the tomb at that point, you can set up the terms of the rematch. As soon as she is restored, Valin is able to see through the eyes of Savras throughout the tomb, and she uses <wc-fetch type=spell>dimension door</wc-fetch> to move directly from her sarcophagus to the characters' location provided they&rsquo;re still in the tomb.</p>
<p>If the characters leave the tomb before Valin re-forms, the mummy lord oracle might hunt them down, becoming a recurring villain. If the characters bring Alessia with them but don&rsquo;t remove Valin&rsquo;s heart from her, the vengeful mummy lord tries to recover her heart by the most direct means.</p>

At your discretion, the characters can return the scholar&rsquo;s body to Candlekeep so that she can be returned to life (perhaps with the characters performing the rites). Alternatively, you might decide that the nature of Valin&rsquo;s ritual prevents Mayastan from being restored to life even with a <wc-fetch type=spell>resurrection</wc-fetch> spell. The characters might thus be charged with a side quest to learn more about the ritual, with the knowledge they gain eventually allowing the sage to be resurrected.</p>

If the characters rescue Alessia, the young priest is overwhelmed by the realization of what was done to her but grateful to the characters for their actions. She might remain in the House of the All-Seeing Orb, return to Candlekeep to take up a place among the scholars there, or stay with the characters (especially if the party has a base of operations and other NPC followers).</p>
