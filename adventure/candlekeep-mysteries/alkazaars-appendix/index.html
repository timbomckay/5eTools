<p>This adventure revolves around a thin book titled <em>Alkazaar&rsquo;s Appendix</em>, brought to Candlekeep by a renowned explorer named Alkazaar in 1363 DR, the Year of the Wyvern. This slim volume accompanied a thicker tome titled <em>Alkazaar&rsquo;s Thrilling Tales</em>, in which Alkazaar chronicled his numerous heroic exploits. He bequeathed these books to Candlekeep and also gifted the Avowed with a series of live storytelling sessions. The longer-lived Avowed remember these performances with fondness and have passed the stories on to the adjutants over the years. One story stands out from all the others, and the Avowed of Candlekeep wonder about it to this day: the tale of the lost golem, featuring the one adventure that Alkazaar could not complete. This story is told in <em>Alkazaar&rsquo;s Appendix</em>.</p>

The picture-portal can teleport the adventurers to the golem. The book was found by members of a tribe of nomadic people called the Bedine, who live in the desert of Anauroch. The Bedine are discussing what to do with the golem and how they can profit from it. The golem appears inactive, but the party can figure out how to activate the golem from the book. By talking with the Bedine, the adventurers learn about a ruined cave complex known as the Hall of Rainbows that could contain clues to the golem&rsquo;s origin. But the Bedine also warn that the cave complex is in the territory of a deadly purple worm.</p>
<p>The adventurers travel to the Hall of Rainbows. After defeating the worm, they discover clues that lead to the ruined city of Azumar. They must navigate the ruins and find the vault where the golem&rsquo;s master, Prince Hamukai, now rests.</p>
<p>In the final showdown, the party must defeat a dracolich named Zikzokrishka and then command the golem to open the vault and complete its missionâ€”to deliver the prince&rsquo;s body to Elysium.</p>

Tales proliferate about his daring and incredible discoveries across FaerÃ»n. Knowing that the definitive collection of Alkazaar&rsquo;s adventures rests within the walls of Candlekeep is reason enough for an adventurer to seek out this legendary book and claim a cozy corner to read about the escapades of Alkazaar and his dungeon-delving companions. <em>Alkazaar&rsquo;s Thrilling Tales</em> is a hefty tome, but its smaller companionâ€”<em>Alkazaar&rsquo;s Appendix</em>â€”contains the intriguing story of Alkazaar&rsquo;s one unfinished quest.</p>
<p>The Avowed in Candlekeep{$i }could bring <em>Alkazaar&rsquo;s Appendix</em> to the characters' attention and approach the characters (especially if the party has visited Candlekeep before) in hopes that they can complete Alkazaar&rsquo;s unfinished quest and perhaps procure for the library the fabled <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch> that Alkazaar believed the golem once guarded.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an ogre named Little One (see the &ldquo;<strong>area Little One</strong>&rdquo; sidebar in the &ldquo;Candlekeep&rdquo; section earlier in this book) might approach the characters while they&rsquo;re relaxing in the Hearth and give them the books, thinking they might be intrigued by the tale of the lost golem.</p>

Embossed gold letters proclaim the title on its lavishly decorated cover. Its beautifully rendered interior abounds with images of Alkazaar&rsquo;s handsome, mustachioed face under his wide-brimmed hat. Alkazaar is often shown with the wind whipping at his flowing shirt but having no effect on his tight pantaloons and shiny boots. He&rsquo;s depicted looking marvelous in fantastical realms alongside his rugged and ready adventuring companions.</p>
<p><em>Alkazaar&rsquo;s Appendix</em> is barely half an inch thick but otherwise has the dimensions of its companion. When it is opened, a few grains of sand fall from between its crisp, dry pages. It contains the story of the lost golem as well as detailed drawings of a stone golem with a brilliant blue sapphire for a heart. One of these illustrations doubles as a portal to Anauroch (see &ldquo;<strong>area The Picture Portal</strong>&rdquo; below).</p>

<ul>
<li>Alkazaar was searching for a <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>. This was to be his last adventure before retiring.</li>
<li>In the Anauroch desert, he came across a wandering stone golem. Alkazaar believed this golem was the legendary Sapphire Sentinel, rumored to have been created by Netherese wizards to protect one of the fabled <em>Nether Scrolls</em> under the control of Prince Hamukai.</li>
<li>The golem recognized its master&rsquo;s name, Hamukai, when Alkazaar mentioned it. From that point on the golem followed him, obeying his commands.</li>
<li>The golem communicated through sign language. It seemed lost and sad.</li>
<li>Alkazaar met Bedine nomads who said they knew of a place that held clues about the golem, but it was in purple worm territory. He followed the Bedine guides until a sandstorm obscured the route. The camels ran off, and, after losing his guides and his transportation, Alkazaar called an end to the expedition.</li>
<li>Before he left the desert, Alkazaar inscribed a magical tracer on the golem in the hope that he could find it again.</li>
<li>He begs the reader to go to Anauroch and find the lost golem, which might lead to the discovery of a <em>Neth__er Scroll</em>.</li>
<li>On the final page of the story, cryptic symbols surround an illustration of the golem. If deciphered, this code reveals the magic words to activate the picture portal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=the-picture-portal>
<a href=#the-picture-portal class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>The Picture Portal</h3><p>The symbols bordering the illustration of the golem unlock magic that turns the picture into a portal, teleporting any adventurer willing to touch the portal to where the golem waits, thanks to the tracer inscribed on it.</p>
<p>Deciphering the code requires 1 hour of study. After that, a character knows the magic words needed to activate the portal.</p>
<p>When an adventurer activates the portal, it stays active for 1 minute and then reverts back to an ordinary picture. Anyone who touches the activated portal appears instantly in an unoccupied space within 50 feet of the golem (see &ldquo;<strong>area Arriving in Anauroch</strong>&rdquo; later in the adventure).</p>

The wizards gave the golem a sapphire heart and magically bound a sliver from the gem to the right palm of its master, Hamukai. They charged the young wizard-prince of the ancient nation of Anauria with guarding the priceless scroll. The sapphires allowed both Hamukai and the golem (whether together or separate) to unlock a magically sealed vault that held the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>The blue dragon Zikzokrishka discovered the scroll&rsquo;s location, and she arrived at the vault ready to destroy any and all in her path. In the ensuing battle, the golem gravely wounded Zikzokrishka, but she blasted the golem with eldritch magic that damaged its memory and hurled it to a far corner of FaerÃ»n. Thinking his golem destroyed, Hamukai put a shield around the vault containing the scroll that could be opened only by the sapphire&rsquo;s power. Too weak to continue the fight, Zikzokrishka limped away to heal her wounds. But as she left, she incanted a powerful Netherese curse: when the prince died, the shield would disappear and the scroll would be hers for the taking.</p>
<p>Knowing that Zikzokrishka&rsquo;s curse had sealed his fate, Hamukai made a decision. Against the wishes of his subjects, who dearly loved him, the prince ordered his wizards to perform a ritual that would keep him on the brink of death for millennia. His magically sustained life force would maintain the shield that would seal him in the vault and protect the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>. Since opening the vault required either the sapphire shard in his right palm or the golem&rsquo;s sapphire heart (which he assumed was destroyed along with the golem), Hamukai felt sure of the scroll&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Zikzokrishka returned with an army, intent on ripping the sapphire from the prince&rsquo;s head. She scattered the populace and reduced the prince&rsquo;s city of Azumar to ruin. To her dismay, she found the prince&rsquo;s tomb to be impregnable. Howling with rage, Zikzokrishka knew that the spell that kept the prince alive would thwart her curse for thousands of years, far beyond her draconic life span. In her thirst for power, she sought and achieved transformation into a dracolich, willing to wait an eternity to outlast the spell that held Hamukai near death, knowing his life force would one day dissipate and the vault would become openable.</p>
<p>As she held her vigil, the desert wasteland of Anauroch consumed the city. Believing the golem and its sapphire to be destroyed, Zikzokrishka now lies coiled around the vault&rsquo;s entrance, waiting with the patience of undeath for the death of the prince, surrounded by her undead minions and jealously guarding her promise of godhood.</p>

The most famous include the lost cities of Netheril, an empire of wizards doomed by their lust for magical power.</p>
<p>When the characters come through the portal, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The desert sun blinds your eyes, and you feel the heat trying to pull every bit of moisture from your body. The bone-dry air makes each breath burn hot and taste of the baked earth.</p>
<p>Below you, about fifty feet away, a camel watches two desert nomads unearth a hulking stone golem half-buried in the sand. Intent on their investigation of the golem, they don&rsquo;t notice your arrival.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two desert nomads (use the bandit stat block) and a camel they call Old Stink (for good reason) hail from a Bedine tribe. They are discussing what to do with the golem. Their curiosity about its potential value conflicts with their fear of disturbing items of Netherese origin. The golem sits motionless, its eyes glowing dimly.</p>
<p>The Bedine nomads are wary of the characters until they assess the party&rsquo;s intentions. A successful DC 12 Charisma check quickly allays their fears.</p>

Bedine tribes differ in how friendly or hostile they are to outsiders. But all Bedine obey a code of hospitality and honor, and they provide shelter, food (goat cheese and dates), and drink (strong tea or water) to anyone who visits the desert unless the visitors prove unworthy of such kindness.</p>
<p>Bedine guides know how to survive in the desert. Stories about the magical destruction wrought by the Netherese on Anauroch make them wary of wizards and abhor magic, believing that it brings destruction and ruin.</p>
<p>Bedine are dark-haired and olive-skinned, with brown eyes. They wear a loose-fitting, linen robe called an aba, covered by a dark cloak called a jellaba. They carry daggers and scimitars as weapons, and some use eagles and falcons to catch prey such as small antelope and hares.</p>

<p>Shamir is Pesh&rsquo;s grandfather. He&rsquo;s cautious and pragmatic, with a kind and honorable heart. As an elder of a Bedine tribe, he is wary of magic users and not above scolding them, citing the folly of the Netherese and how their arrogance destroyed a once lush and verdant land.</p>
<p>Shamir is cautious and superstitious, but he&rsquo;s also intelligent and curious. The blue circle painted on the golem&rsquo;s chest and the symbols on its body make him think it&rsquo;s the same golem he heard about as a boy. His grandmother used to tell a strange story about a foreigner named Alkazaar and a lost golem with a sapphire heart that once guarded a powerful treasure. He believes this to be the same golem. His grandmother tried to guide Alkazaar to the caves of Haruun, but a sandstorm created by a wild djinni drove them back. A cavern inside Haruun called the Hall of Rainbows holds colorful paintings, some of which depict a golem.</p>
<p>Shamir knows the story of Hamukai and his stone golem and can help the characters remember the details as needed.</p>

<ul>
<li>The golem understands Common but can&rsquo;t speak.</li>

The outer surface of the disk is inscribed with a blue circle that has eight golden beams radiating from it like rays of the sun.</p>
<p>The disk can be removed to reveal the glowing sapphire only when the golem receives a command to use its power from someone whose commands it obeys (see &ldquo;Getting the Golem&rsquo;s Attention&rdquo; below). Otherwise, the sapphire remains hidden. The gemstone is 6 inches in diameter and has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is indestructible until the golem completes its mission.</li>
<li>The sapphire has 3 charges. As an action, the golem can expend 1 charge to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> (as a 9th-level spell) from the sapphire using Constitution as its spellcasting ability. The sapphire ceases to glow if all its charges are expended, but it regains <wc-roll>1d3</wc-roll> expended charges daily at dawn and glows again once it has 1 or more charges.</li>
<li>The golem attacks anyone who tries to remove the sapphire, which is worth 25,000 gp.</li>

Its stone face grinds and changes into a pleased expression as its eyes light up. It then bonds with and follows the party member who mentioned the name and obeys that person&rsquo;s commands.</p>
<p>Attempting to pry out the sapphire in its chest activates the golem, and it does not take kindly to thieves. If provoked further, it fights to the death.</p>

Characters can infer the golem&rsquo;s intent through its gestures and body language. The golem rubs its head when it&rsquo;s confused, becomes animated when it&rsquo;s excited, and slumps its shoulders when it loses hope.</p>
<p>The golem also employs a unique sign language created by its master, Hamukai. Any character who spends 1 hour observing the golem as it uses this sign language can, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check, learn enough of the language to communicate with the golem on a basic level. A character who fails the check can repeat it after spending another hour watching the golem communicate in this fashion.</p>
<p>The golem&rsquo;s memories are damaged and it wants to return to its master, Prince Hamukai. It has vague impressions of its past. The golem can be as communicative or as noncommunicative as you like.</p>

On seeing the golem restored, Zikzokrishka can&rsquo;t contain her glee. She tries to destroy the golem so she can use the sapphire to open the vault and steal the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>. If the dracolich is defeated, the golem goes to be reunited with its master and complete its mission to deliver Hamukai&rsquo;s body and the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch> to Elysium.</p>
<p>Over the course of the journey, the golem might face mortal peril. If it drops to 0 hit points, the golem stabilizes and topples over but isn&rsquo;t destroyed. It doesn&rsquo;t make death saving throws, and it can be revived and repaired using healing magic. If it has 0 hit points after being struck by a <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic, the golem is obliterated, but the sapphire is left behind.</p>

Anauroch holds lost cities, savage monsters, and more than its share of otherworldly phenomena.</p>
<p>Traveling across the desert by day is not recommended. Use the extreme heat rules in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide for daytime travel in Anauroch.</p>
<p>Traveling in the cool of the night is the best way to journey across the desert, but explorers should beware of nocturnal creatures hunting for prey.</p>
<p>The Bedine travel mostly by night, along the ancient roads and paths that crisscross Anauroch. Some of these paths are invisible on the ground, and the Bedine navigate by using the stars at night. Groups of Bedine might be traders carrying goods, scouts looking for food, or bandits hoping to raid merchant caravans that try to shortcut their way across the desert rather than circumnavigate it.</p>
<p>The Bedine nomads can act as guides for lost characters, offer clues for stuck players, and provide food and water for adventurers in desperate need.</p>

Bleached humanoid bones lie half-buried in the sand around the pedestal.</p>
<p>Any character who touches the sphinx telepathically receives the following riddle:</p>

<p><em>With every stroke, the storm is wrung</em></p>
<p><em>Of darkness by my zeal.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The riddle&rsquo;s answer is lightning. The first character who answers the riddle correctly while touching the sphinx gains resistance to lightning damage for 10 days. If an incorrect answer is given, the statue transforms into an androsphinx and attacks the party. If it is victorious, the sphinx returns to its pedestal and reverts to its inanimate state.

Those who fled the destruction of Azumar thousands of years ago used this area as a refuge. Over time, they carved and painted the interiors with the story of their prince, the golem, the battle, and the vault containing the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>Within the last five centuries, all the caverns except one have been reduced to rubble as the area fell under the sway of a purple worm. Only a small section of the old cavern complex now remainsâ€”the Hall of Rainbows.</p>
<p>When the characters arrive, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The landscape around you bears the scars of a purple worm&rsquo;s habitation, a complex of caves that collapsed as the worm created its rubble-filled tunnels. You see a crack in the face of a cliff that looks like an entrance to an undamaged cave. Around it, a few fifteen-foot-diameter, rubble-filled holes provide clear evidence of a purple worm&rsquo;s passage. Vultures circle overhead, as if anticipating scraps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the adventurers explore this place, every so often they feel rumblingâ€”caused by the passage of a purple worm moving below the surface. Play up the tension if the characters make any disturbance during their exploration of the caves, since it&rsquo;s well known that purple worms are alerted by vibrations in the ground.</p>
<p>The following locations are keyed to the map of Haruun. Unless otherwise noted, all tunnels are sandstone, unlit, and 12 feet high.</p>

<p>As they enter the cave, the characters see that the walls are sculpted and chiseled, empty sconces dot the walls, and chunks of stuccoâ€”once brightly painted with scenes and writingâ€”lie crumbled on the floor. Long, viscid, rubbery tubes of glistening purple worm dung lie strewn about, giving off their acrid odor.</p>

Worm Rubble</h3><p>Rubble from the passage of a purple worm blocks the tunnel, with chunks of stone reaching almost to the ceiling. A character who clambers to the top of the rubble sees that the tunnel continues on the other side, but one must make the climb with care or risk causing the rubble to shift and alert the worm (see below).</p>
<p>Removing enough debris to allow a Small or Medium humanoid to fit through the opening takes one person about an hour, but the noise caused by the work could summon a hungry purple worm. To avoid doing so, whoever is clearing the rubble must succeed on two DC 15 Dexterity or Strength checks. Failure on either check means a boulder falls from a height or the character slips and causes a cascade of rubble, alerting the worm&rsquo;s <wc-fetch type=sense>tremorsense</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>Once a gap is created, the rubble counts as difficult terrain.</p>

<p>The tunnel opens into a cave fifty feet long, thirty feet wide, and twenty feet tall. Bats chitter near the ceiling, and the floor reeks with mounds of their guano. Colorfully painted frescoes line the walls deeper in the cave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wizards who escaped Zikzokrishka&rsquo;s wrath used this cave as a scriptorium and hall of records. They recorded what they knew and continued their work. What remains are benches, wooden desks, and scaffolding gnawed by beetle larva and ravaged by time. Evidence of a cooking fire and tools lie at the far end of the cave, partially covered by the rubble from a purple worm&rsquo;s passage.</p>
<p>The brightly colored murals are intact, and <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> or similar magic causes the magic ink that preserves the work to glow.</p>
<p>Any Bedine with the party display amazement on seeing the murals, since the works prove that their legends about a city that was destroyed by a dragon are true. Shamir says that he knows of a cursed place in the desert that looks like the ruined city depicted in <strong>area mural F</strong>. He is willing to guide the party there.</p>
<p>If the golem sees the murals, it looks confused or reacts with vague recognition as it tries to recall images from its fractured memory.</p>
<p>Each mural measures 10 feet by 10 feet and has a caption below it written in Draconic. The images are described below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You crest a dune and see a rocky escarpment in the distance with small cave entrances all over its surface. Dozens of tiny humanoid creatures dash back into the caves, sensing your presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tiny creatures are desert-dwelling Chwinga (see their stat block at <strong>area the end of the adventure</strong>) that live in tiny caves built up on the shell of a giant dragon tortoise. If the characters approach the escarpment, the earth rumbles as the dragon tortoise raises its massive head out of the sand, addresses them, and asks their intentions.</p>
<p>For the dragon tortoise, use the dragon turtle stat block with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It speaks Draconic and Terran.</li>
<li>It lacks a swimming speed and the Amphibious trait.</li>
<li>Its breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of abrasive sand instead of steam that deals slashing damage instead of fire damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dragon Tortoise has been trapped here for millennia, <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> by magic chains. Ogruhl was the prisoner of a cruel Netherese wizard. When the city around the tortoise was abandoned, Ogruhl was left to die. A band of chwingas found the tortoise and brought it food and water little by little to keep it alive. Over time, the chwingas and Ogruhl developed a symbiotic relationshipâ€”it defended them and provided a home for them, and they helped it to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Helping Ogruhl</strong>. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check determines that the chains that bind Ogruhl can be broken with a successful <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> spell (DC 19).</p>
<p>If commanded to do so, the Sapphire Sentinel uses its sapphire heart to cast <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> with a flash of blue light. If the players don&rsquo;t realize that the golem can dispel magic, you can have the golem do this automatically and the players learn about it that way.</p>
<p>If freed, Ogruhl expresses its immense gratitude and eagerly wants to reclaim its ancestral territory. The bravest chwingas come out to bestow a charm on each of the characters.</p>

The city fell into ruin thousands of years ago and is now surrounded by sand dunes that partially bury its outer walls and buildings. No structures on the surface aside from the mastaba remain completely intact.</p>
<p>This place feels like a graveyard, where battle and the sands of time destroyed a city and its population. It&rsquo;s eerily silent except for the hissing of the sandstorm in the distance. Despite the silence, the characters can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that they&rsquo;re being watched (even though the city is clearly abandoned).</p>
<p>As the characters enter the necropolis, read the following boxed text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see before you a city that has long fallen to ruin. Scoured husks of once-magnificent stone buildings jut out of the desert like rotted teeth. Emerging from under the smothering sands, the remnants of ancient streets wind their way around crumbled walls and through the rubble of collapsed buildings. Ahead, you see and hear a sandstorm in the middle of the ruined city that swirls in place like the dome of an immense, seething cathedral.</p>
</blockquote>

With the exception of the mastaba (see <strong>area area V1</strong>), the necropolis consists of a series of ruined stone walls jutting out of the sand and patches of paved streets revealed by the howling winds. The swirling sandstorm at its center can be seen and heard from anywhere in the necropolis.</p>
<p>The necropolis also contains buried treasures. A character who searches for an hour and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check finds some hidden treasure determined by rolling on the Treasure Hoard: Challenge 5â€“10 table in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. Up to four such hoards can be found before the city is picked clean.</p>
<p>To keep the characters on their toes, you can use one of the following encounters.</p>

<p>Each character must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be caught in the iron grip of <wc-roll>1d4 + 1</wc-roll> skeletal arms that are anchored to the sands. Each arm has AC 13 and 10 hit points. They try to drag a captured character underground (use the quicksand rules in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide). Not until all the arms holding a character are destroyed can that character pull itself out of the sand or be pulled out by others.</p>

With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check, a character recalls the hats worn by the wizards on the murals in the Hall of Rainbows. (One or more players might remember this even if their characters don&rsquo;t.) The flameskulls are startled upon seeing the adventurers and begin chattering to one another, wondering what to do about these strange visitors.</p>
<p>These are the remains of the Consortium of Three, the Netherese wizards who were loyal to Prince Hamukai. After establishing the refuge at Haruun, they honed their magic and vowed to return to Azumar to defeat Zikzokrishka. When they did, they discovered to their horror that Zikzokrishka had transformed into a dracolich, becoming even more powerful. They were defeated, transformed into flameskulls by the dracolich, and commanded to guard her necropolis for eternity. Though their minds are warped by their current state, if the characters try to befriend the flameskullsâ€”invoking their names and appealing to their loyalty to the princeâ€”the flameskulls offer to help. A character must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check to sway the flameskulls. Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) checks do not work on them.</p>
<p>If the characters antagonize the flameskulls or fail to communicate with them, the flameskulls either attack or flee to alert Helmdar, the storm giant skeleton in <strong>area area V1</strong>.</p>

Zikzokrishka created this disturbance to keep everyone else out until she gains the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>When the adventurers arrive at the outer edge of the sandstorm, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see a dome-shaped sandstorm, four hundred feet wide, before you. Flashes of purple lightning course through the roiling storm, and the sound of the sand is nearly deafening. Scoured bones litter the ground beneath it, and the stone of the nearby ruins has been gouged by its ceaseless winds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dome of swirling sand is 80 feet thick. The properties of the sandstorm are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any creature that enters the sandstorm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the storm takes 55 (<wc-roll>10d10</wc-roll>) slashing damage.</li>
<li>Creatures in the sandstorm are <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sapphire Sentinel <wc-fetch type=spell>dispel magic</wc-fetch> creates a 20-foot-wide, 20-foot-high tunnel through the sandstorm that lasts for 1 minute.</p>
<p>Those who make it through the sandstorm emerge to see the ruined wall and the mastaba that houses the vault. The following locations are keyed to the map of the mastaba.</p>

Mastaba</h3><p>This mastaba is a 20-foot-high mesa built from 50- to 80-ton megaliths in the form of a step pyramid with a mausoleum on top of it. A ruined stone wall surrounds the mastaba, which is the only structure still standing in the area.</p>
<p>Inside the wall, sand lies in deep drifts over the stone floor. Three Giant Scorpion and four Wight hide under the sand at each end of the mastaba, in the locations indicated on the map, ready to attack anyone who climbs the nearest steps. The wights chant a word in Netherese (&ldquo;Meat!") in a rasping chorus as they advance. If fighting breaks out at either end of the mastaba, a storm giant skeleton (see the accompanying stat block) lying dormant on top of the mausoleum awakens and attacks.</p>
<p>The storm giant, Helmdar, was sent to destroy two frost giant criminals who stole a <wc-fetch type=item>horn of blasting</wc-fetch> from a storm giant king. Helmdar completed his mission but was killed by Zikzokrishka and turned into an undead thrall to guard her lair.</p>

Mausoleum</h3><p>Locked stone double doors stand at opposite ends of this structure. Each double door requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open using thieves' tools. A <wc-fetch type=spell>knock</wc-fetch> spell or similar magic also opens a double door. Characters can also try to smash open the doors, which have AC 17, 100 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>
<p>If the storm giant skeleton (see<strong>area area V1</strong>) was not alerted earlier, it awakens and attacks as soon as either double door opens. It can enter the mausoleum. When the characters open a door, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you is a sixty-foot-long, twenty-foot-wide, pillared hall brightly lit by torches in wall sconces. The carved floral motifs on the pillars have faded, and the walls are covered with cracked and crumbling paintings of farm life in a verdant landscape. A stone staircase leads down.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stairs, you see a thirty-foot-wide by sixty-foot-long hall lit with blue crystals that are set into the walls and pillars in the room. At the far end, a dais stands before a limestone door inscribed with symbols and glyphs that glow dimly. Framing the door, the crystallized bones of a dragon are embedded in the wall, its wings outstretched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zikzokrishka, an adult blue dracolich, guards the doorway to the vault. She lies flush against the wall and ceiling over the far door so that she looks like a decoration. A character who looks closely, underneath the crystalline deposits on the skeleton, can see that one of the dragon&rsquo;s eyes has been destroyed (hearkening back to the murals in the Hall of Rainbows).</p>

<p>If the golem is instructed to open the door, read the following boxed text aloud to describe this event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The golem&rsquo;s chest opens to reveal its sapphire heart. Blue light bursts from the gem and hits the double door. The symbols on the doors glow with blue fire, accompanied by a perceptible shudder and a crackle of magical energy. With a groan and the grinding of stone on stone, the doors open for the first time in ages.</p>
</blockquote>

Hall of Records</h3><p>The walls along this hallway of descending staircases contain a record of the deeds the prince accomplished in his life. The plaster and the paintings are perfectly intact. Scenes include images of him tending to the welfare of his people and the matters of the city, reading books, falling in love, and cultivating his garden.</p>
<p>About halfway down the staircase, the paintings turn to depicting the entombment of the prince, the spell cast by the wizards of Netheril, the sealing of the prince in the sarcophagus with the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>, the return of Zikzokrishka, and the destruction of Azumar. As the golem views these murals, sand begins to trickle from its eyes.</p>
<p>Closer to area V5, the paintings depict more recent events: the characters' journey from Candlekeep, their first contact with the golem, their adventures across Anauroch, their exploration of Haruun, and their encounter with Zikzokrishka. The final painting is of the characters standing before the prince&rsquo;s tomb. It shows them in exactly the positions they&rsquo;re all holding, rendered in perfect detail.</p>

Vault</h3><p>When the party reaches the vault, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spacious tomb holds a sarcophagus made of stone covered with glyphs. Magically glowing stars painted on the stone adorn the ceiling. The west wall bears a carving of a beautiful scene of a river and rolling hills inside a stone frame etched with symbols.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The carving of the river scene is a portal to Elysium that activates when the golem enters the room. If the golem does so, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A glyph appears on the golem and illuminates, and at the same time the scene on the west wall of the room slowly comes to life. The carved river begins to flow, and the flowering plants by the river take on color and start to wave in a gentle breeze. The stone frame looks like a portal to this beautiful place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stone golem looks at the party member who is bonded with it as if awaiting its next command.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus is 5 feet tall and covered in Netherese incantations that have kept the prince in suspended animation inside it for millennia. If the sarcophagus is opened, the spell keeping the prince alive fails. Within a matter of seconds, his body turns to dust.</p>
<p>The portal is a one-way door to the plane of Elysium. The symbols etched around the frame form the following inscription in Draconic: &ldquo;May Hamukai find his way to Elysium and eternal rest for his sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Open the Sarcophagus</strong>. Opening the sarcophagus ages the prince thousands of years in a few seconds, turning him to dust but leaving his treasures (including the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>) intact. If the Sapphire Sentinel is active, it shudders and falls to its knees, its sapphire heart cracks with an audible pop (rendering it worthless), and the golem turns to dust.</p>
<p><strong>Let the Golem Do Its Thing</strong>. If the Sapphire Sentinel is allowed to do as it wishes, it pushes the prince&rsquo;s sealed sarcophagus through the portal into Elysium. Three Solar meet the golem on the other side, open the sarcophagus, welcome the prince into the afterlife, and take the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch> into safekeeping.</p>
<p><strong>Revive the Prince</strong>. The prince is a human archmage, but only a <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell can keep him alive after the sarcophagus is opened. If a wish is used to prevent the prince from turning to dust or to resurrect him after he turns to dust, he thanks the characters profusely. He embraces his Sapphire Sentinel as it bows before him, sands of joy pouring from its eyes. The prince speaks Common and offers the characters all the treasure in his sarcophagus, except for his memoirs, the sapphire shard, and the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>. Then, without hesitation, he walks into Elysium alongside the golem, taking his memoirs and the <em>Nether Scroll</em> with him.</p>

She then rushes to the sarcophagus and cracks the seal, turning the prince to dust. Then she grabs the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>, howling with maniacal laughter. The dracolich&rsquo;s mastery of magic and her evil spirit enable her to access the darker aspects of the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>, turning the sky over Anauroch black and ushering in a reign of terror and darkness over the desert. She rules the southern part of Anauroch from her lair with cruelty and malice. Her presence prevents caravans from crossing the desert, and she enslaves Bedine tribes or turns them into undead thralls to serve her whims.</p>
<p>Paladins, members of holy orders, and Harpers across FaerÃ»n respond to the disaster in a joint campaign to defeat the dracolich and destroy the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>.</p>

If the characters defeat her, Zikzokrishka uses her phylactery to rematerialize, having long ago prepared a dragon&rsquo;s corpse to house her spirit upon its return to the phylactery. She relentlessly seeks them out, using all her evil ingenuity to recover the <wc-fetch type=item>Nether Scroll of Azumar</wc-fetch>. Zikzokrishka harbors a personal vendetta against the characters, who remain targets of her wrath even if they don&rsquo;t have the <em>Nether Scroll</em>.</p>

They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more humanoids, its curiosity compels it to shadow those creatures for a short time and observe them. If it takes a liking to a particular humanoid, a chwinga uses its cantrips to aid it, or bestows a magical gift before departing. The features that attract a chwinga to a particular humanoid vary. A chwinga might like the way a humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair, or be smitten by a humanoid&rsquo;s ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.</p>
<p>Chwingas that live in the desert can bestow the following additional supernatural charms:</p>
