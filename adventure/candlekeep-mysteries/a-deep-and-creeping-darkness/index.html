<p><em>A Deep and Creeping Darkness</em> came to Candlekeep with another group of adventurers, given to them by a villager who found it among her grandfather&rsquo;s old possessions. Her grandfatherâ€”a traveling bard in his youthâ€”claimed to have written it. Though appearing to be nothing more than a combination of diary and penny dreadful, the book satisfied the requirement of a unique work to grant that party entrance to Candlekeep. It chronicles the death of a mountain village called Vermeillon by slow, unknown means. Following a terrible accident in the platinum mine, survivors and other villagers began disappearing. Eventually Vermeillon&rsquo;s population all vanished or fled, leaving the village abandoned. (They never discovered the cause: a nest of meenlocks.)</p>

Through divination magic, the speculators learned that a book in Candlekeep holds clues to the mystery. They give the characters another book to use as a means of entrance, which gets them in&mldr; barely.</p>
<p>The Avowed at the front gates are initially doubtful about the quality or desirability of the work. After enough debate to make the players nervous, they accept the book. Characters gain entrance to the Court of Air, where they are assigned rooms at the House of Rest, a study room at the Pillars of Pedagogy, and an adjutant guide. Their guide is surprised and thankful that the characters already know the name of the work they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Characters who aren&rsquo;t specifically investigating the village can discover <em>A Deep and Creeping Darkness</em> while researching one of the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local history, legends, and lore</li>
<li>The mining industry</li>
<li>Unexplained disappearances of individuals and entire settlements</li>

The book presents a series of vignettes allegedly collected from &ldquo;those who were there&rdquo;: survivors, traveling merchants, and (in secondhand accounts) residents of nearby settlements. It is unclear whether it is a fictional tale, folklore, or history. The content seems factual, but the language is extravagantly dramatic.</p>
<p>Vermeillon, established after settlers discovered a platinum vein in the mountainside, did a booming business in both the raw ore and the refined metal for around a decade. Due to the rough terrain and the harshness of the climate, the village never grew large. It intermittently hosted a succession of traveling merchants who came to the village for a week or two, sold and traded their wares, then left again. The nearest civilized settlement was three days' ride on horseback down the mountainside. The inhabitants named in the book include Mayor Lei Duvezin, a kind and talented dwarf smith named Tormun, and his wife, Blenyss.</p>
<p>Seventy years ago, an explosion rocked the platinum mine, collapsing the tunnels and burying workers under tons of rubble. Sixty miners were underground that day. Over thirty of them died in the initial collapse, and the instability of the tunnels made rescue of the others slow and dangerous. The miners who survived the collapse were trapped for days or weeks before they were rescuedâ€”or perished in the deep, alone and terrified. Sixteen came out alive. Eleven were never found.</p>
<p>In the wake of the catastrophe, another horror plagued the village as people began to disappear, starting with the survivorsâ€”not all at once, however. One or two would vanish in a single night, then a tenday might pass before the next disappearance. These unexplained disappearances terrified the remaining miners. After all the survivors either disappeared or fled, other villagers began to vanish. The villagers tried to protect themselves by sleeping with weapons and taking shifts on watch, but nothing changed. Traveling in groups didn&rsquo;t help, since a companion might vanish while even briefly out of sight.</p>
<p>With no one willing to keep the mine open and the disappearances leading to fears that Vermeillon might be cursed, merchants and other travelers stopped visiting the village. The end of the patchwork story claims that the village is still there, though whether anyone inhabits it is a mystery. The volume&rsquo;s writer muses over the decline of the village, speculating about the fate of its inhabitants. They wonder whether it would be worth hiring adventurers to see if anything remains of the villageâ€”particularly the platinum ore. Sketched on the back of the last page is a rough map of the village&rsquo;s location, with directions from the closest mountain town, called Maerin.</p>

Their strange, twisting lair affixed itself to the tunnels of the mine like a leech. The creatures spent days psychically tormenting the trapped miners before taking them to their lair for further torture and, eventually, transformation. After all the trapped miners were captured or diedâ€”or were rescuedâ€”the meenlocks turned their attention to the village.</p>
<p>The lingering fear and trauma of the surviving miners called like a beacon to the meenlocks, who exploited the impaired mental states of the villagers and influenced their dreams to sow more terror. Slowly but surely, with ruthless patience and efficiency, the meenlocks tormented and kidnapped the remaining miners, and then started in on their friends and family. Most of the populace eventually fled. Those who remained behind were taken, one by one, and transformed into meenlocks.</p>
<p>A bard who heard about the catastrophe decided to chronicle the stories of the survivors. He traveled the area extensively, avoiding Vermeillon but seeking out its former residents in nearby towns.</p>
<p>His account failed to draw interest, and the book remained among the remnants of his bardic career until his granddaughter found it and sent it on its way to Candlekeep.</p>

The town of Maerin is the most likely stopover before attempting the trip into the mountains. If you&rsquo;re running a homebrew campaign, insert Maerin wherever it makes sense for you or substitute an already-existing town in your own world.</p>
<p>Nestled at the foot of a mountain range, the town is the last bastion of civilization before the inhospitable climate of the peaks. Not large enough to be called a city, Maerin is nonetheless bustling. Shops, taverns, and other establishments abound, as well as an open-air market at the center of town where vendors of all sorts hawk their wares.</p>
<p>Most of the citizens of Maerin have scant knowledge of the village hidden in the mountains above them. Two former residents of Vermeillon can share their experiences: Lukas Grosvenor, the owner of the Bored Weasel tavern and inn, and Astra Vorn, a flower vendor in the market.</p>

Plenty of platinum lies in the ground near Vermeillon, and adventurers who make it accessible could be rewarded with a share of the mine&rsquo;s profits once production starts up again. Vermeillon as a potential home base or means of additional income could be an irresistible temptation for forward-thinking groups. Either Lukas or Astra in Maerin mentions this possibility in passing, if needed, though neither claims any knowledge of where to find the rightful owners.</p>

The menu of tavern fare is simple but satisfying; the establishment is best known for a flavorful, piping-hot stew called Salty Fish Surprise. (Where the fish comes from is a mystery best left unsolved.) A large bowl of the stew costs 3 cp, while a small cup of it costs 1 cp.</p>

<p><em>Neutral good human tavernkeeper (age 95)</em></p>
<p>Lukas is patient, though he suffers no fools. He has a charming smile for anyone who gives him a kind word or a good tip. His hunched shoulders have only a hint of the strength they once had, and his hands are callused from years of work.</p>
<p>Lukas lived in Vermeillon and worked there as a miner. His young wife, Lorna, died in the disaster. He left after her death but before the disappearances started. If the characters announce that they&rsquo;re heading to Vermeillon, he asks them to place flowers on his wife&rsquo;s grave for him, and to find her old necklace in a hollow of the tree in the center of the village and return it to him. Lukas can give them a rough map of the village, though he notes a lot can change in seventy years.</p>

<p><em>Lawful good half-elf florist (age 78)</em></p>
<p>Astra has pale skin, shoulder-length red hair streaked through with white, and cloudy blue eyes. They run a flower stall in the market. Friendly and a bit wistful, Astra chats with anyone who stops at their stall, as happy to hear the recent news as to make a sale.</p>
<p>Astra was a child when their family left Vermeillon, so their knowledge of the forgotten village is clouded by time and the hazy memories of the very young. They remember the disaster at the mine, bits of conversation overheard from adults talking in hushed whispers, and the gossip of the other children. Astra&rsquo;s family fled the village when Astra&rsquo;s mother began to experience nightmares.</p>

Though most of the creatures returned to the Feywild once the village was empty, six Meenlock (see <strong>area the end of the adventure</strong> for their stat block) remained to prey on lost travelers. When the characters arrive in the village, these meenlocks become aware of their presence and stalk them from a distance, staying hidden in the shadows.</p>
<p>The meenlocks of Vermeillon include three that spawned after the disaster in the mine, two that were once villagers, and one that was a traveling merchant who thought he&rsquo;d found a shortcut through the peaks. The three original meenlocks stay within the nest, while the other three venture into the village to torment the characters, either individually or as a group. You can change the number of meenlocks in in the village, depending on the number of characters and their abilities.</p>
<p>As the party makes its way through the village, the meenlocks try to remain unseen as they begin to psychically haunt the characters, causing hallucinations. Pick one character to target, or spread the hallucinations between multiple party members. A few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters see movement out of the corner of their eyes, but when they turn to look, nothing is there.</li>
<li>A voice whispers indistinct words in their ears.</li>
<li>A terrified shriek splits the air.</li>
<li>Shadows follow the characters, stretching out abnormally across the floor to reach for them.</li>
<li>Characters who view themselves in a reflection momentarily see the face of a lost loved one or a hated enemy instead of their own.</li>
<li>The hair on their arms and neck stands up, and the space between their shoulder blades itches. They can&rsquo;t shake the feeling of being watched.</li>
</ul>

They prefer to stay in their nest until nightfall, though they sometimes hunt on overcast days.</p>
<p>The meenlocks avoid combat with a well-armed group of foes. If the characters don&rsquo;t split up on their own, the meenlocks try to divide the party using their ability to create hallucinations. Their aim is to isolate and paralyze one character, then drag that character back to their nest to be tortured and transformed into a meenlock. If given the opportunity, meenlocks psychically torment their prey for hours or days, breaking down their mental and emotional state to make the eventual transformation easier.</p>
<p>Be devious and tricksy with these foesâ€”they&rsquo;re intelligent creatures, not mindless monsters driven by bloodlust. Hide them from the characters for as long as possible to heighten the mystery and suspense.</p>

Mayor&rsquo;s House</h4><blockquote>
<p>This grand, two-story brick house has fallen prey to time and the elements like the rest of the village, but it remains in better shape than the smaller houses. Heavy wooden double doors are flanked by dark windows, and chimneys anchor the building at each corner, their masonry crumbling. In front of the house looms a wide, leafless tree. Its gnarled branches reach toward the clouds like twisted fingers, and its rough bark is pockmarked with large knots and beetle holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This house belonged to Mayor Lei Duvezin and her family. When the villagers continued to disappear, and the others fled, Mayor Duvezin sent her wife, Tifra, and their two small children to Maerin to wait until it was safe. Tifra fell ill not long after their arrival in Maerin and passed away three weeks later. The children remained there for a time before being sent off to the care of distant relatives. Mayor Duvezin was determined to find the source of the disappearances, stop them, and rescue anyone she could. As it happened, she was the last villager taken by the meenlocks.</p>
<p>If the characters decide to explore the house, see &ldquo;<strong>area Mayor Duvezin&rsquo;s House</strong>&rdquo; later in the adventure for more information about this location.</p>

Graveyard</h4><blockquote>
<p>A crooked, wrought iron archway stands at the entrance to the graveyard, which is overgrown like the rest of the village. Headstones sit at odd angles, some toppled completely. Small cairns, rather than inscribed headstones, mark the graves toward the back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters who take time to read the inscriptions notice that the headstones near the cairns bear the same death date, which is also the date of the mine collapse. The cairns were intended to be temporary, but with so many stones needing to be carved at the same time, the stonemason was unable to complete all the work before she was taken by the meenlocks.</p>
<p>Characters who look for Lorna Grosvenor&rsquo;s grave can find it in the section at the back, a few headstones away from the cairns. Her stone stands a bit tilted but stable, and reads:</p>

Merchant&rsquo;s Cart</h4><blockquote>
<p>The road heading northwest out of the village is soon overcome by overgrowth and disuse. Not too far past the graveyard, a cart stands abandoned in the middle of the road, covered with a heavy tarp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cart belonged to a traveling merchant who was taken by the meenlocks a little less than a year ago.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, the party finds the remains of a horse in the tall grass, still tethered to the front of the cart. Under the tarp are boxes, barrels, and trunks. Many of these containers are broken and empty; the few that remain carry salted dried meats (still edible but not tasty), three bolts of common fabric (10 gp each), and two small casks of wine (25 gp each). A successful Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>) or Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check reveals the following information:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>)</strong>: The growth around the wheels and the decay of the horse&rsquo;s carcass suggests that the cart has lain here for roughly a year.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Survival</wc-fetch>)</strong>: The scratches and tooth marks on the broken and empty containers lead one to conclude they were damaged by animals.</p>
<p><strong>DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>)</strong>: The driver&rsquo;s seat lifts up to reveal a compartment. Inside this compartment is a pouch containing 15 gp and a ledger listing sales in settlements around the area.</p>

The meenlock that was once Mayor Duvezin now lurks around the mayor&rsquo;s mansion, drawn there by lingering memories, and it takes any opportunity to attack characters in the house.</p>
<p>The meenlock shed its clothing and other trappings of its former life once the transformation was complete, but it still wears the mayor&rsquo;s ring of office: an ornate platinum signet ring embossed with a snowdrop blossom (75 gp). The characters can recover the ring upon the meenlock&rsquo;s death or notice it during combat with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. The ring offers a hint to the fate of the mayor, and also serves as a potential plot hook if the characters decide to track down the mayor&rsquo;s children to return the item and give them closure on their mother&rsquo;s fate.</p>

The house served as both the home of the mayor and the center of government. Meals were prepared in the village and brought to the manor, and the servants slept in nearby cottages.</p>
<p>The house hides clues to the death of the village, for characters who take the time to look. If any characters are left behind in a room on their own, or if the party splits up to search the house, that&rsquo;s an ideal time for a meenlock encounter.</p>

Master Bedroom</h4><blockquote>
<p>A double bed sits beneath the windows along the far wall. A fireplace occupies one corner, and a window looks out onto the front yard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room belonged to Mayor Duvezin and her wife, Tifra. A search of the room yields a pile of crumpled, half-written letters on the fireplace mantelpiece, beseeching other nearby settlements for aid; among them is a completed letter addressed to the mayor of Maerin. This letter is stuffed in an envelope and sealed shut with a bright red wax seal embossed with an ornate snowdrop blossom; sticks of sealing wax in various colors as well as quills, ink, and paper; and the journal of Mayor Lei Duvezin.</p>
<p>The journal chronicles the disaster at the mine and the village&rsquo;s anguish at so many victims. The mayor recounts the rescue efforts in the following days, and how they had to stop the search due to fears of more cave-ins if they attempted to remove any more of the rubble, even with miners still missing. She writes of villagers going missing in the night, of her helplessness, and of stubbornly staying on, determined to find the missing villagers while Tifra and their two children, Tavin and Nia, evacuated to Maerin. The last few pages speak of the mayor&rsquo;s nightmares, of her creeping fear and waking in the night, soaked in sweat, with lingering screams echoing in her ears.</p>

Library</h4><blockquote>
<p>Shelves filled with books line the walls of this library, and four wingback chairs sit around a low table in the center of the room. The wide bank of windows in the south wall affords a panoramic view of the dilapidated houses beyond the twisting branches of the tree in the front yard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the village&rsquo;s business was conducted on the first floor of the mansion, the mayor and her wife spent their personal time in this room. The shelves hold books of all sorts, from tomes on history and treatises on business to thin volumes of folktales and grand, sweeping novels. An entire section on arcane theory includes books about the other planes of existence. If you so desire, the library can include books relevant to other plots in your campaign.</p>
<p>Several open books lie on the table, with notes scribbled on bits of paper stuck between their pages. The topics include the effects of physical and emotional trauma, nightmares, and mysterious disappearances. Seemingly out of place in comparison to the other topics, a book about the Feywild and its sundry creatures holds a single note, written in a shaky hand. It reads: <em>Could this be the answer?</em></p>
<p>{@i }The note marks a page with an entry on meenlocks, which includes the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meenlocks are corrupted fey creatures that spontaneously manifest in response to fear in places where the border with the Feywild is thin.</li>
<li>Meenlocks create more of their kind by transforming humanoids through a process of psychic torment that takes hours or days.</li>
<li>Meenlocks live in subterranean nests.</li>
<li>Meenlocks are sensitive to bright light and can sense shadows and darkness.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time Mayor Duvezin discovered this book, she was already being harried by the meenlocks. They took her shortly afterward.</p>

<p>If the characters explore during the day, the first 30 feet inside the mine are dimly lit, and anything beyond 30 feet is in darkness.

<p>The opening of this tunnel is nearly circular. Black moss covers the walls, floor, and ceiling of the tunnel as far as you can see. Within this tunnel are several branches, all of them covered in the same black moss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The notable aspect of this tunnel is the uniform layer of black moss over everything. Characters who scrape the moss away from the rock see that the walls are smooth, not rough-carved by pick and shovel like the rest of the mine. Because the meenlock tunnels spontaneously manifested rather than being dug out, there are no scratch marks or signs of excavation on the walls, floor, or ceiling here. The moss muffles all sound, causing a lack of echoes and creating a sense of claustrophobia.</p>
<p>A successful DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>) check reveals that the tunnels were not created by hand, claw, or tool, but rather by magic or another strange effect; if the check succeeds by 4 or more, the character pieces together the clues, if they haven&rsquo;t done so already, and realizes that meenlocks created the moss-covered tunnels.</p>

<p>This dead-end cavern opens wide, and the lingering dampness of the tunnels is pronounced in here. Moisture leaches through the moss ceiling above, forming fat droplets that fall into pools of dark water around the chamber.

</blockquote>
<p>The pools here vary in depth: the smaller ones are a few inches deep, and the larger pools measure 2 feet at their deepest. In the subterranean darkness, the pools look black. Light sources reflect off the water as if it were a dark mirror, and the characters are unable to see below the surface.</p>
<p>This is another ideal ambush location for the meenlocks or, if you want to shake things up a bit, for a black pudding or other ooze to lurk on the surface of one of the pools like an oil slick.</p>

Attached to each pillar is a stick of dynamite with a long fuse leading to a plunger trigger. Any character who has a passive Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) score of 18 or higher spots a candle-like object attached to each pillar, partially hidden beneath the moss. A character who closely examines a pillar spots the dynamite stick and the fuse leading from it with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. A character can cut a fuse as an action (no ability check required). If a dynamite stick takes damage from any source, it explodes (as described below).</p>
<p>The meenlocks trigger the explosives as a last resort. If a meenlock starts its turn with 10 hit points or fewer, it moves to the nearest trigger, uses its action to set off the explosion, and then uses its Shadow Teleport bonus action to escape. The pillar is destroyed in the explosion. The last meenlock detonates any remaining pillars before it flees. Any creature within 5 feet of an exploding dynamite stick must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If all four pillars are destroyed, the cavern&rsquo;s ceiling partially collapses. Each creature in the cavern when the collapse occurs must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (<wc-roll>4d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage, falls <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>, and is <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> by the rubble and unable to stand up; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&rsquo;t trapped in the rubble or knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>. A creature can use its action to attempt to free itself or another creature trapped under the rubble within its reach, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. Meenlocks that flee return the next night to see what they&rsquo;ve caught in their trap.</p>

A shallow lake on the mountainside above the meenlock lair (directly above <strong>area area M8</strong>) is fed by a stream that becomes a river when summer melts the snow. When the full moon hangs in the night sky, the lake becomes a fey crossing. Anyone who completely submerges in the icy waters during this time surfaces in the Feywild.</p>

The new villagers treat the characters as local heroes. As news travels, Tormun and Blenyss eventually hear of the village&rsquo;s resurrection and return to restart their shop, unable to pass up the opportunity of being so close to a platinum mine.</p>
<p>If the meenlocks survive, travelers continue to go missing if they attempt to take the road through Vermeillon. The number of meenlocks in the nest grows to eventually threaten the town of Maerin.</p>

Whenever fear overwhelms a creature in the Feywild, or in any other location where the Feywild&rsquo;s influence is strong, one or more meenlocks might spontaneously arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels open up within it. One of these newly formed passageways serves as the lair&rsquo;s only entrance and exit. Inside the warren, black moss covers every surface, muffling sound. A large central chamber serves as the meenlocks' den, where they torment captives.</p>

These hallucinations take the form of terrible whispers or fleeting movements just at the edges of one&rsquo;s peripheral vision.</p>
<p>During the day, meenlocks confine themselves to their dark warrens. At night, they crawl out of their tunnels to torment sleeping prey (see the &ldquo;Telepathic Torment&rdquo; sidebar).</p>

This torment has no effect on a creature that is immune to the <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch> condition. If the creature is susceptible and remains <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> for 1 hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 (<wc-roll>3d6</wc-roll>) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The save DC is equal to 10 + the number of meenlocks participating in the torment, considering only those that remain within sight of the victim for the entire hour and aren&rsquo;t <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> during it. The process can be repeated. A humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meenlock at full health and under the DM&rsquo;s control.
