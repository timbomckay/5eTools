<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>It goes without saying, but this is a great dungeon. How did the characters get here? Who cares?! They&rsquo;re here now, and that&rsquo;s enough to deal with without dwelling on the past. Maybe this is all a bad dream, or some hallucination brought on by eating gnarly shrimp. Are there safe places to take rests? That&rsquo;s up to you, although I say no rest for the Ricked.</p>
<p>What about the treasure the characters find here, can they sell it anywhere? Are there things they spend their gold on? To that I say: Isn&rsquo;t the acquisition of treasure the best part? (Translation: There aren&rsquo;t any weird underground-dwelling vendors in here, no. But if the characters are persistent, perhaps some of these dank-ass dungeon denizens will deign to deal.)</p>

(I&rsquo;m getting into that wizards-did-it bulls**t right off.)</p>
<p>Rooms and hallways in the dungeon are made of rough-hewn stone. Ceilings are 20 feet high. Doors are made of wood and have AC 15, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Unless the description of an area says so, all the doors in the dungeon are unlocked. They&rsquo;re also not into humanoids, so don&rsquo;t try to seduce them.</p>
<p>Some of these rooms might seem a little cramped if you compare the activities inside to the map. But it&rsquo;s magic, so, like, the rooms are just sometimes bigger on the inside. I&rsquo;m all about that D! (That stands for &ldquo;dimensional transcendence,&rdquo; obviously.)</p>
<p>Oh, and once a room&rsquo;s been solved and passed, none of its features trigger again if the characters go back the way they came. Any monsters and NPCs hanging out in there might yell rude things, though.</p>

Because they can wander around the dungeon in any kind of bananas-ass circuitous route, as a general guideline, you can let them hit 2nd level at about 30 percent of the way through the adventure, then hit 3rd level at 75 percent of the way through.</p>

Working as intended. Second, if the characters die, the players also die in real life. Third, that was a jokeâ€”dead players are no fun for anybody. How are you supposed to lord your powers over corpses? Anyway, you can get creative about bringing back dead characters. One pro move is to take the dead character&rsquo;s sheet, cross out the old name, and write a new name with, like, one letter different from before. That&rsquo;s the player&rsquo;s new character, who suddenly steps in from the previous room! Carry on.</p>

Right now. Just do it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re an adventurer. Or maybe you&rsquo;re even a group of adventurers. Whatever.</p>
<p>Why are you here? No one cares. Don&rsquo;t tell me your backstory. We&rsquo;re here to kick ass and find treasure. That&rsquo;s your motivation. Now get ready to roll!</p>
<p>In front of you is a dark staircase. Its mysterious shadows beckon you to enter. And by &ldquo;beckon,&rdquo; I mean you need to go down the stairs, or there&rsquo;s not a hell of a lot of purpose for us all sitting around this table, is there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good start, right? No taverns or want ads or wizards begging you to retrieve the Bauble of Blarglebop. Which, by the way, is actually completely worthless to the Blarglebopians. Total waste of your time.</p>

Stirge Room</h3><p>When the characters descend the stairs into this room, read the following to set the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room is dark and smells like a pet store. It&rsquo;s all wood chips and warm poop down here. A bunch of bats flap around the room. They look harmless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bats aren&rsquo;t harmless. They&rsquo;re not even bats; they&rsquo;re Stirge. If the characters aren&rsquo;t, like, super well hidden, these non-bats notice them and attack immediately. Sounds like it&rsquo;s time to roll initiative!</p>
<p>I wrote &ldquo;bunch&rdquo; in the description, but you should use at least three stirges. If you have more than three characters in your game, then add more stirges to match the character count, so all the characters can fight their own flying rodents and feel good about themselves if they kill one.</p>

Searchingâ€”whether the characters find anything or notâ€”also makes their hands smell like stirge poo, which imposes disadvantage on their Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws until it&rsquo;s washed off.</p>

Goblin Room</h3><p>As the adventurers approach this room, have everyone make a DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Anyone who succeeds can hear two Goblin talking in Goblin about how their friend Jerry is a useless jerk.</p>
<p>When the characters enter or peek inside the room, read this description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room features a small wooden table and a couple of stools. Two goblins hang out here, looking pretty bored. Maybe they&rsquo;d be less bored if they got into a life-or-death struggle with a few adventurers? Just a thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the goblins is wearing an eye patch. Her name is &ldquo;Leg.&rdquo; The other goblin has a bad leg, and his name is &ldquo;Eye.&rdquo; If the characters are sneaky, they might be able to surprise these losers. Otherwise, if the party attacks, these gobbo-slobbos fight back. But before they both die, at least one flees to their pals in <strong>area area 5</strong>.</p>

Statue Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>This room is sort of trapezoidal, with doors to the east, north, and south. It&rsquo;s also got statues kind of scattered aroundâ€”mostly statues of Rick with inscriptions like &ldquo;WOW!&rdquo; and &ldquo;DAMN!&rdquo; One of the statues depicts a woman in armorâ€”really fine crafting, real interesting. Seems like a great artist worked hard on this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>At the base of the statue, a plaque reads: &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T WORRY. I&rsquo;M NOT A REAL PERSON TURNED TO STONE. I&rsquo;M JUST A COOL-LOOKING STATUE PUT HERE TO INTRIGUE YOU.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s probably nothing. You should pick a door, let&rsquo;s get a move on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A careful search accompanied by a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check reveals a hidden compartment in this statue that holds a scrap of paper. Inspecting the paper reveals a note written in Common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>QUIT WASTING TIME! PICK A DOOR AND GO! FLIP A COIN IF YOU HAVE TOâ€”JUST PICK A DIRECTION! IT&rsquo;S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE! WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT STANDING IN HERE WITH A STATUE? YOU NEED TO PICK A DOOR AND GOOOO! THIS IS, LIKE, THE THIRD F***ING ROOM, WE DON&rsquo;T HAVE ALL DAY!</p>

Magic Mouth Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>This rectangular room conveniently conforms to a grid for easy map-making. On the north wall is a big orange mouth, about eight feet high. Yeah, it&rsquo;s gross and weird. There&rsquo;s nothing else you can see in this room, and you&rsquo;re not really looking anywhere else, because I mean, what the effâ€”it&rsquo;s a giant wall mouth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as any character says anything out loud, the wall-mouth interrupts by shrieking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;SURPRISE! ANSWER THIS RIDDLE! YOU HAVE TO DO IT!</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-M-H-D-W-M.</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHAT&rsquo;S NEXT IN LINE?</p>
<p>&ldquo;SOLVE THIS RIDDLE AND SOMETHING COOL HAPPENS. IF YOU FAIL, IT&rsquo;S BAD. WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR ANSWER?&rdquo;</p>

<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/RMBRE/010-intro-3.png alt=undefined class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>The party has one chance collectively to answer the riddle. One!</p>
<p>If they try to leave, the characters discover that the way out is blocked by an invisible wall that can&rsquo;t be attacked or dispelled or anything. Describe how their faces smoosh up against it, then laugh at them.</p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re trying to figure out the answer, pretend you&rsquo;re the big orange mouth and smack your lips a bunch. Get all gross with your tongue so the players have trouble concentrating on anything else.</p>
<p>The mouth spits out anything placed in it. If the characters are stupid enough to try destroying the mouth instead of answering, have any moron who attacks it get licked for 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) shame damage. That&rsquo;s right: shame. There&rsquo;s no resistance to shame.</p>

<p>If any character answers correctly, the mouth smiles and magically hawks up 50 gp. If the party gets it wrong, the mouth laughs and gives them the answer in a really smarmy voice. Then every item each character hasâ€”except for their primary weaponâ€”vanishes. Armor, clothes, adventuring gear, treasure, snacks, everything. All this equipment is teleported to the treasure room (<strong>area area 6</strong>), but the characters don&rsquo;t know that right now.</p>
<p>Either way, the mouth then disappears and the invisible wall vanishes.</p>

If Leg or Eye from <strong>area area 2</strong> fled here, all the goblins have grabbed their scimitars and set up an ambushâ€”but around the entrance opposite the one the party comes through. If Leg or Eye didn&rsquo;t make it here, the characters catch the goblins even more off guard.</p>
<p>If the adventurers are naked (most likely because of the mouth in <strong>area area 4</strong>, but for any reason, really), the goblins have disadvantage on attack rolls in the first round of combat, as they giggle at the group&rsquo;s jiggly unmentionables.</p>

But a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check made to poke through the dice and parchments reveals that they were actually playing <em>Goblins & Gizzards</em> (G&G), their favorite tabletop roleplaying game, written in Goblin.</p>
<p><em>Goblins & Gizzards</em> is way better than D&D.</p>

Their gaming setup also features a really nice set of eleven greenish-yellow dice. Each die is worth 1 gp and comes with a lifetime of warm, murderous memories (adding no additional value). Any character who takes these dice has the strong urge to collect more. Many, many more.</p>

Treasure Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>This dusty old room features a sweet-ass treasure chest. You sense that bling is imminent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters lost their clothes, armor, and other equipment when they failed to guess the wall-mouth&rsquo;s riddle in <strong>area area 4</strong> or flipped an unfortunate series of levers in <strong>area area 31</strong>, this is where all their possessions ended up. If that happened, read this additional revelation:</p>

If the chest is opened, the character opening it needs to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw as a screeching buzz-saw blade pops up out of the chest. On a failed save, the blade slices that character right in the gut for 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) slashing damage.</p>
<p>When someone opens the chest, get all quiet for a second, then make a loud buzz saw screeching noise. Just do it. Scare the s*** out of them.</p>

Third Goblin Room</h3><p>As the party approaches this room, pick a character at random and demand a Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. If they get a 10 or higher, they hear voices arguing beyond the door in what sounds like Goblin. Because it is Goblin, and there are goblins in there.</p>
<p>If the characters open the door, drop this on them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two pissed-off goblins chatter in their native language. Between them is the dead body of a third goblin. All of them look alike, so maybe they&rsquo;re related? Something for your noodle to bake on for a while.</p>
<p>Behind them is a pile of glittering treasure. Wealth beyond reckoning! It could be yours! Just deal with these goblins first, and remember: these are someone&rsquo;s mommy and daddy, maybe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All three of these little monsters (living and dead) have armor and weapons. Once they notice the characters, they drag them into the argument too. The two Goblin speak only a little Common, so their speech is mostly Goblin chittering with Common words sprinkled in: &ldquo;murder,&rdquo; &ldquo;treasure,&rdquo; &ldquo;a-hole,&rdquo; that kind of thing. Anyone who speaks Goblin understands that the two goblins are accusing each other of murdering the third. Classic.</p>

Fine. Let them try to interrogate the goblins and inspect the body. The goblins just chatter away angrily and blame each other for the murder. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check, a character searching the body discovers coins scattered near its mouth. If they&rsquo;re gutsy enough to pry the dead gob&rsquo;s mouth open, they&rsquo;ll find it full of coins as well.</p>
<p>If these observations are pointed out to the living goblins, they both act shocked. A hearty and successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check reveals they&rsquo;re full of s***. A successful DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check then pries a confession out of them.</p>
<p>The goblins switch immediately from being argumentative to being ashamed. In halting Common, they admit that they dared their friend to swallow more coins than they did (around 100 gp for each of them). If the characters demand they cough up the gold, the goblins try to make themselves vomit. This creates all kinds of terrible noises, but those coins are happy right where they are: in the tum-tum.</p>
<p>If the characters still don&rsquo;t attack after all that, the goblins flee the room, left alive to pass on their successful genetics and create more coin-eating idiots.</p>

Who cares who killed the goblin? They&rsquo;re all little monsters, get rid of them! Jeez, I hate goblins. Every time you kill a goblin, somewhere out there, a Rick gets his wings. Nice work. If the gobs from <strong>area area 5</strong> are still breathing, they join in this mayhem after <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> rounds of combat.</p>

If killed, each of the other goblins holds 100 gp in their stomach.</p>
<p>All the rest of the glittering pile of treasure in the room turns out to be gold-wrapped chocolate coins, which are worth exactly squat but likely would have been less fatal in a coin-swallowing contest. They are poisonous to dogs, though, so don&rsquo;t mess around.</p>

Writer&rsquo;s Room</h3><p>This room&rsquo;s not done. The deadline really crept up on me, but don&rsquo;t sweat it. I&rsquo;ve got a writer on it, and she&rsquo;s writing like her life depends on itâ€”because it does! Lay it all down by reading the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything in this odd-shaped room is whiteâ€”the walls, the floor, the ceiling. Everything, that is, except the four doors and a stressed-looking lady seated at a cheap desk, writing furiously on paper. Or how about parchment? And she&rsquo;s got an inkwell and a quill pen. How&rsquo;s that for immersion?</p>
<p>A second after the door is opened, the room elongates until it&rsquo;s a hundred feet long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If questioned, the writer (a commoner) explains that she&rsquo;s under a ton of pressure to finish writing this part of the dungeon. She has the power to shape the room based on what she writes on the parchment. (Only what she writes. No one else can write on the parchment. Union rules.) As long as she&rsquo;s able to write, she changes the room&rsquo;s shape and throws obstacles in the party&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p>Those obstacles might be accidental to start with (including making the door disappear that the characters came in through, just to get things rolling). But if the characters keep on bothering her, crazy s*** starts to happen in earnest as the writer frantically writes intentional obstacles into the room to stymie the party. Once that happens, roll initiative. It&rsquo;s nothing personal, but she&rsquo;s not done with this assignment yet, and she reeeally needs this job.</p>
<p>To stop the writer, the characters can kill or incapacitate her, or they can destroy the inkwell on the desk. The inkwell has an AC of 20 (it&rsquo;s quite hard to hit) and 10 hit points (it&rsquo;s a nice inkwell).</p>
<p>The writer can also be persuaded to stop writing with three successful DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) checks. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many checks the characters fail while they try to get the writer on their side. On the first success, the writer appears to hesitate before continuing to write, and the room shrinks a bit. The second success indicates more progress, and she looks almost won over. On the third success, the writer throws down her quill, declares that work-life balance is essential, and triumphantly exits the room, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>As long as she&rsquo;s able to write, though, the effects created by the writer make moving through this area a challenge for the characters.</p>
<h4 id=malleable-space>
<a href=#malleable-space class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Malleable Space</h4><p>The room&rsquo;s normal form is reflected on the map. It reverts to that form if the writer is <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch> or leaves the room. But until that happens, the room looks nothing like what the map shows. The writer can use her inkwell and parchment to make the room any size she wants, up to 100 feet by 100 feet, but she defaults to transforming it into a 40-foot-wide-by-100-foot-long tunnel to keep distractions away from her while she&rsquo;s working. She can also make the room&rsquo;s doors disappear or reappear at her whim.</p>
<p>This could all probably be way simpler, but we&rsquo;re waiting until the writer&rsquo;s done with the adventure before telling her she has to redraw the whole damn map. How&rsquo;s she going to draw an area that changes sizes? Maybe it&rsquo;s all an illusion. Whatever. That&rsquo;s her problem.</p>

<p>Check this room out. It&rsquo;s a little pantry. Why a pantry? Because monsters have to eat. Believe it or not, the creatures that dwell in this dungeon exist even when you chumps aren&rsquo;t parading through their s***.</p>
<p>The room reeks of vinegar. Shelves line the walls on either side of you. They contain oversized pickle jars, which probably accounts for the stink. Most of the jars are filled with just brine, but a dozen still contain enormous pickles nearly two feet long.</p>
<p>The jars are wider than the shelves, so they stick out over the edge. Also, there&rsquo;s a ten-foot ladder blocking the middle of the pantry, leaning against one of the upper shelves.</p>

<p>This room is hard to move through without touching at least one of the jars. Any Medium or larger creature that attempts to cross the pantry must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check or jostle a jar as it moves through the room. A creature that fails the check by 5 or more knocks a jar down, causing it to smash on the ground, shatter into a thousand vinegar-soaked pieces, and release its contents.

<p>Once free of its jar, a lycanthropickle grows pickle arms and pickle legs, and proceeds to chase and attack any nonpickles in the room. Characters who choose to battle the lycanthropickles must make additional Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) checks each round to avoid interacting with the jars, risking the release of more frenzied fruits. (Yeah, cucumbers are fruitsâ€”fight me.)</p>
<p>No more than six Lycanthropickle can attack the characters at one time. If additional pickle jars are shattered while six lycanthropickles are at large, they release only slightly spicy but otherwise normal pickles.</p>

<p>The two-foot-long pickle in the jar you just jostled turns to face you. Which is to say, the pickle has a face. Let me say that again: it&rsquo;s a pickle with a face. It starts to head-butt the jar from the inside, edging it towardâ€”you guessed itâ€”the edge of the shelf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Left to its own devices, the lycanthropickle in the jar sends the jar plummeting to the ground at the end of the next round. Upon doing so, the jar shatters, releasing the lycanthropickle. If a jar is knocked off the shelf with a really bad check, it automatically smashes to free the lycanthropickle within. Either way, the tiny terror immediately springs up and attacks the closest nonpickle.</p>
<p>This alerts <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> other lycanthropickles, which start head-butting their own jars, and which escape at the end of the following round unless thwarted. A character can use an action to pick up a jar with an agitated pickle and place it safely on the ground, preventing it from smashing.</p>

The curse lasts for 3 days. Each long rest the creature spends in a vat or jar of pickling brine prolongs the curse by 1 day.</p>
<p>A lycanthropickle can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthropickle retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its boring life as it always has, burying deep its raging, murderous urges just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. They can assume pickle form or hybrid form at will. Most Lycanthropickle that embrace their briny natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak. In hybrid form, a lycanthropickle has the same statistics as a twig blight with the altered ability noted in area 9. In pickle form, a lycanthropickle has no statistics and is indistinguishable from a pickle&mldr; because it&rsquo;s a pickle.</p>

<p>A pair of perfectly rounded stone mounds, cleft artfully straight down the middle, fills this room. It looks a lot like a butt from where you&rsquo;re standing.

<p>Each butt cheek is made of polished stone that gleams in any light. It takes a successful DC 12 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check to scramble up either cheek&rsquo;s baby-smooth surface to see what the shiny thing is.</p>

<p>On the bright side, this doesn&rsquo;t inflict damage or pain. The creature just doesn&rsquo;t have a butt anymore.

Orc Gift Room</h3><p>Are orcs evil? Normally, evil is hard to pin down, but according to the parameters of this game, evil is a thing, and orcs are of that thing.</p>
<p>A follow-up question: Is wrecking a family&rsquo;s holiday dinner and gift-giving evil? What if that family is evil? You tell me, because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s about to go down here and in <strong>area area 12</strong>. Read the following to set the tragic scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Six orcs kneeling near the south wall of this room are busy stuffing various goods inside sacks and crates. They grunt to each other every so often, and occasionally show off an object such as a vegetable or a sock to the approval of the other orcs around them. They pay no attention to anything but their weird task.</p>

<p>The orcs then stand up and make their way to <strong>area area 12</strong>â€”that is, unless the characters grab their attention. The orcs know this dungeon is crazy dangerous, so they defend themselves if attacked. However, they aren&rsquo;t otherwise inclined to fight as they hurry to <strong>area area 12</strong>. Three of the orcs are armed with greataxes, but the other three carry only the large burlap sacks they have slung over their shoulders. Replace those orcs' greataxe attack with the following attack:</p>

Festive Dinner Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>A warm fire crackles in a fireplace along the far wall of this chamber. Several orcs sit around a long table that&rsquo;s set for a feast, complete with a large, covered silver platter at the center. The smell of baking bread and spiced potatoes fills the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least five adult Orc occupy this room, and as many as eleven if all the orcs from area 11 managed to make it home for supper.</p>
<p>If the characters killed any orcs in area 11, they&rsquo;ll note empty place settings at the table for any missing orcs. Once they make their presence known to this group of orcs, the characters see two juvenile orcs (noncombatants) emerge from under the table. They point at the character in the lead and say (in Orc) with tears in their eyes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mommy. Did she send you with my present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regardless of how depressing things get (and even if all the orcs from area 11 are safe and sound), the adult orcs move to put themselves between the characters and the two kids. Some of the orcs are pretty old, and they start yelling at the &ldquo;heroes,&rdquo; demanding to know what in the Nine Hells is going on (again, in Orc). If the characters don&rsquo;t leave or can&rsquo;t convince the orcs that they mean no harm, the orcs assume harm is coming, and they attack. One of the elderly orcs tries to escape with the terrified, bawling children, fleeing the dungeon if successful.</p>

<p>Remember, orcs are evil (whatever that means in a morally relativistic society), regardless of their healthy family relationships. Before the characters crashed the feast, the orcs were gathered around the table for a delicious meal of goblin meat. Lifting the cover of the silver platter at the center of the table reveals a bound and gagged (but still living) male goblin.</p>
<p>If freed, the goblin expresses his gratitude by swearing a blood oath to the party. He follows them, whether they want him to or not, until he has repaid their generosity. His name is Frumfle, and he spits when he talks.</p>

He truly believes that everything will work out. Sure, he has his doubts sometimes, like when he was about to be eaten alive only moments ago. But he doggedly clings to the notion that the multiverse has a plan. He&rsquo;s fond of saying, &ldquo;Pay it forward,&rdquo; though he thinks that saying means, &ldquo;One good turn deserves another.&rdquo; This explains why if anyone gives him a hand, he refuses to leave their side until he&rsquo;s repaid them in kind.</p>
<p>When faced with danger, Frumfle does his best to put himself between it and the character he&rsquo;s sworn to protect. If he fails at that mission, he bolts away from danger as fast as he can.</p>

Da Mage Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>A narrow walkway two feet across hugs the wall of this circular chamber. Beyond the edge of the walkway yawns a nasty, twenty-foot-deep pitâ€”evidently a trap that succeeded at its intended purpose. An attractive young woman in wizard&rsquo;s robes is impaled on a nasty-looking spike at the pit&rsquo;s bottom and gasping for breath. If she&rsquo;s some kind of illusion, she&rsquo;s a convincing one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure at the bottom of the pit is an evil mage named Glizzlegus. She was a member of the last group I ran through this dungeon. She rolled a 1 on her Dexterity saving throw and has 1 hit point remaining. When Glizzlegus spots the characters, she lifts her head. &ldquo;Please, help me,&rdquo; she rasps. Sounds like she&rsquo;s got some lung damage. Oops!</p>

Even once that&rsquo;s done, though, she still needs medical assistance so that gigantic spike hole doesn&rsquo;t kill her. If magical healing isn&rsquo;t available, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Medicine</wc-fetch>) check is required to suture her wounds. (If Beth is playing, encourage her not to use healing magic and give her advantage on the skill check.)</p>
<p>If she is healed, Gliz pretends to be nice until her sudden but inevitable betrayal. She doesn&rsquo;t know jack about the dungeon and wants all its treasure for herself. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check figures out she&rsquo;s Trouble with a capital T.</p>

Synecdoche Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>Well, what have we here? Let&rsquo;s take a lookâ€”some kind of designs carved in relief on the floor? From above, you realize that these designs are actually dozens of tiny hallways connected to tiny rooms. Some have teensy treasure chests, while others feature tiny traps that would have trouble catching a mouse.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not mice these traps are after&mldr; then trail off dramatically&mldr;</p>
<p>Sorry, that was a note to myself. I shouldn&rsquo;t have read that out loud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick inspection of the relief-carved floor makes the following facts clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>This room is filled with a top-down view of a minuscule-scale dungeon.</li>
<li>An adventuring party comprised of a tiny cleric, a tiny fighter, a tiny rogue, and a tiny wizard cheerfully slog their way through the tiny dungeon. So cute!</li>
<li>Lying on the stone floor outside the minuscule dungeon are several carved wooden figurines: a green dragon, an ogre, a spider, and a zombie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attempts to communicate with the tiny adventurers are unsuccessful, and the characters can&rsquo;t scoop them out and keep them as pets, either. Same with trying to pilfer any of the treasure chests. Anybody who tries that s*** takes 5 lightning damage. If the characters watch for a few minutes, they see the miniature adventurers get to the last area of the miniature dungeon, look around the empty room quizzically, walk through a door on the far sideâ€”then teleport back to the first room, where they start the whole crawl again from the beginning.</p>
<p>The best thing to do in this scenario, as with most dealings with inferior life-forms, is to put these itty-bitty assholes out of their misery once and for all.</p>
<h4 id=figurines>

The little adventuring party is capable of defeating the giant spider or the zombie, but the ogre or the young green dragon destroy them completely. Facing more than one enemy at a time also melts them to the ground.</p>

Buttless Zombie Room</h3><p>The doors to this room are open just a crack. Regardless of which direction the characters approach from, a gravelly croak for help issues from inside the room. If the characters look inside, read my words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It stiiiinks like old hamburger meat in here. Before you can come to appreciate the delicate bouquet, you see five zombies hunched over another rotten-looking figure in a plush-ass chair. It looks like the zombies are gesturing accusingly at the figure, which appears to be tied up. You miss a lot of the nuance of the zombie debate, though, since they&rsquo;re just grunting and moaning.</p>
<p>If you wanted this room to be weirder, you&rsquo;re in luckâ€”because these zombies got noooo buuuutts!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure tied to the chair is a ghoul, and the five Zombie are accusing it of eating their butts, which it didn&rsquo;t. The butts in question were stolen by the butt trap in <strong>area area 10</strong>, but the zombies have terrible memories.</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">
<img src=https://thegiddylimit.github.io/img/adventure/RMBRE/013-intro-6.png alt=undefined class="mx-auto relative z-10" loading=lazy>
</span></p>
<p>Once any character makes their presence known, the zombies turn toward the party, and the ghoul in the chair calls out: &ldquo;Help! I know I&rsquo;m a ghoul, and this could easily be my thing, but it isn&rsquo;t! The zombies think I ate their butts, but I swear, I didn&rsquo;t! Help me, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghoul implores the characters to go find the zombie butts and prove its innocence. The heroes can choose to find some butts, or hang around and fight some zombies.</p>

If they return to this room after the butt trap in <strong>area area 10</strong> is destroyed, the zombies' butts are restored.

Many Doors Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>At the center of this room floats a tiny orb of energy that lights the area up. The room has two other doors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other doors can&rsquo;t be opened. You might suggest that having all the characters enter the room could help with that. Thing is, when they do all enter the room, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the last of you enters the room, the door you all came through suddenly slams shut!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of doors slamming behind people. After the characters have processed this, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The door you came through and the other doors are no longer alone. All the walls are suddenly covered with identical doorsâ€”twelve in all. Weirdly, you&rsquo;re no longer sure which door you came through to get in here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting out of the room isn&rsquo;t as easy as just going back the way the characters came. But be sure to let them try.</p>

Thankfully, that doesn&rsquo;t matter to start with, because opening any door causes another door to open at random, and characters looking through either door can see into what appears to be this same room. A character who passes through either door emerges through the other. Weird!</p>
<p>After the characters open three doors and the players start to get real huffy, the magic of the room changes things up. Read the following to clue everyone in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the doors suddenly fly open! But where you saw into the same room before, all you see now is darkness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A long, wide room looms before you. Mysterious runes and patterns cover the room&rsquo;s walls and floor. Visible at the end of this long room is some sort of evil mage.

He looks real tough, and he blocks the way to the next room. Figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evil mage (see &ldquo;Attacking the Mage&rdquo; below for his unusual defenses) cackles with glee and taunts the party. He looks like a cartoon fantasy wizard: long white beard, pointy blue hat, stars on his robe, that kind of s***. He declares himself invulnerable to any attack and tells the characters they can&rsquo;t pass unless they defeat him. He&rsquo;s real braggy about it, too. It&rsquo;s super obnoxious.</p>

Sorry about that. With each different type of attack made against him, the mage only increases the number of things he brags about being immune to. &ldquo;Ha! No sword can pierce my flesh!&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;Ha! No sword or arrow can pierce my flesh!&rdquo; Then add halberds, pikes, you name it. He goes on and on like this.</p>
<p>The same is true of magical attacks if the characters go that route. No spells affect the mage, and he just adds them to his laundry list of bragging.</p>

<p>Taken together from left to right, the runes spell &ldquo;RAY GUN.&rdquo; If anyone speaks any other word made up of those combinations of letters out loud, ask them if it hurts to be so stupid. Then assure them that it does, and have them take 1 point of idiot damage.</p>
<p>The first character to say the words &ldquo;ray gun&rdquo; out loud causes a fancy-ass futuristic ray gun to appear hovering in the air in front of them. Firing the ray gun is an action, and it&rsquo;s only useful once. It&rsquo;s the only weapon that can hurt the evil mage. It can&rsquo;t miss, and contains one blast of mage-seeking energy. Which is to say, no matter what you fire it at, it hits the evil mage.</p>
<p>When the ray gun is fired and the evil mage is hit, the blast sends him sprawling out of the characters' path. The ray gun then vanishes forever and the mage reacts with the following dramatics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evil mage drops, holding his shoulder in agony. He screams, cursing &ldquo;this demon weapon&rdquo; he has never seen before. He calls you a &ldquo;piece of s***&rdquo; and other things. Real filthy stuff. We all know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Good call bringing a ray gun to a magic fight.</p>

<p>The box is a Meeseeks box. Pressing the button on the top of the box summonsâ€”predictablyâ€”a Meeseeks. Every Meeseeks appears in the same six-foot-tall, skinny blue humanoid form. Some have little tufts of orange hair on their heads. They use the commoner stat block but ignore hit points, since Meeseeks are immune to damage.</p>
<p>Once materialized, these friendly entities exist solely to fulfill a purpose of your choosing. Pretty nifty, right? For example, you could tell a Meeseeks to read the phrase etched on the pedestal. Once it does that, the Meeseeks vanishes, its purpose fulfilled.</p>
<p>Just a warning, though: if someone gives a Meeseeks a purpose it can&rsquo;t fulfill, or if a Meeseeks is prevented from fulfilling its purpose, it does go sort of insane, becoming hostile toward its summoner after <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> hours.</p>
<p>While the box is in the room, it can summon as many Meeseeks as you like. It&rsquo;s also possible to take the box. If it&rsquo;s used outside the room, though, roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> and add the number of Meeseeks that have already been summoned. If the total is higher than 20, the Meeseeks box implodes and makes a sad whining sound, destroying it.</p>

Think of yourself as the genie who takes your players' wishes extremely literally. Find ways to make a Meeseeks fulfill its purpose and vanish as quickly as you can. The goal isn&rsquo;t to <em>actually</em> make them turn against the party. If the players manage to stump you by giving a Meeseeks a purpose so carefully worded that even you can&rsquo;t figure out a way to subvert it, have that Meeseeks summon another Meeseeks to help out. This soon reveals itself to be a terrible cascading problem.</p>
<p>Generally, Meeseeks are cheerful and eager to help, unless their existences last longer than a few hours. They&rsquo;re unwilling to fight and they&rsquo;re too stupid to solve puzzles. They&rsquo;ll cheer you on, though, even as they provide unhelpful pointers.</p>
<p>Meeseeks have a few distinct qualities you might employ for maximum immersion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constantly speak in a screechy voice. This imposes disadvantage on any Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) checks the characters attempt while a Meeseeks is around.</li>
<li>Begin or end utterances with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mister Meeseeks, look at me!&rdquo; or some variation thereof.</li>
<li>Talk about how a Meeseeks grows facial stubble as it gets closer to its homicidal break.</li>

Evil Clock Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>A small, well-lit chamber opens up before you. In the middle of the floor are two five-foot-square stone tiles that look like the doors of a pit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once all the characters are inside, the door slams shut behind them! Remember when I said I&rsquo;m a big fan of doors slamming behind people? Heh. After this happens, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two tiles in the middle of the floor fall away, and an ominous digital countdown timer rises up from the hole. At the same time, back near the door, a panel bearing a single button descends from the ceiling. Beneath the button, terrifying red block letters spell out the word &ldquo;RAPTURE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lights in the room suddenly cut out, and an eerie glow emanates brightly from the countdown timer, casting the room in an ominous red light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On inspection, it&rsquo;s clear that the timer is counting down from sixty, the total decreasing by one every second. Seems as though the party has a minute before something pretty bad happens. The doors are locked and, in this room, they&rsquo;re made of some kind of indestructible metal. Very inconvenient.</p>
<h4 id=rapture-button>

If the &ldquo;RAPTURE&rdquo; button is pressed at any point during the countdown, the clock resetsâ€”but instead of 60 seconds, it starts at 50 seconds and starts counting down to zero again. This happens every time the button is pressed, with the countdown losing 10 seconds each time (so that it starts again at 40 seconds, then 30, and so on).</p>
<p>You can keep track of the countdown in real time, to whatever degree of accuracy you care about. Be sure to use super threatening language as you describe what&rsquo;s happening. The characters need to feel as though they&rsquo;re delaying an inevitable destruction. Scare them into pressing the button as much as possible and encourage lots of infighting.</p>
<p>When the clock reaches zero, all the doors in the room open and the characters are free to leave. Read the following in your most judgmental voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at all of you! Stop being sheep to your pathetic instincts and think critically for once in your lives. Think about it: I&rsquo;m not going to kill everyone. I can&rsquo;t do that. It would introduce a host of liabilities for me, since if you die in this dungeon, you die in real life.</p>

<p>A horde of goblins wearing yellow shirts and blue pants crowd this room. They&rsquo;re these little munchkin things. I don&rsquo;t know, I never gave them names. But they are reeeeal annoying little pieces of s***, repeating the same patter and spouting undermining nonsense while you try to get work doneâ€”all underpinned with teenage self-image fragility and minuscule attention spans borne from what I can only assume is a life completely unexplored while simultaneously devoid of any real stakes.</p>
<p>Also, they say, &ldquo;Ah jeez!&rdquo; a lot. Too much.</p>
<p>A glass case sits on the far side of the room, next to another door, but there are too many stupid little goblins in the way for you to see it clearly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pushing your way through the crowd of whiny little goblins takes some doing. But once a character finally reaches the glass case, read this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five gems sit in the caseâ€”blue, green, red, yellow, and purple. Next to the case, three conveniently gem-sized sockets are cut into the stone wall. I bet these things are related, huh?</p>

<p>The doors out of this area are shut tight and conveniently immune to damage. They can&rsquo;t be opened or broken through until the gem puzzle is solved (see below).</p>

The remaining yellow and blue gems must be destroyed in some way. It&rsquo;s probably a coincidence that these annoying f***ing goblins are wearing yellow and blue.</p>
<p>If the characters try an incorrect solution to the gem puzzle, the gems return to their initial positions in the caseâ€”and the goblins lose their minds, all crying out anxiously and saying, &ldquo;Ah jeez!&rdquo; a few thousand times.</p>
<p>Are your dumbass players having trouble with this puzzle? Feel free to give them hints. This room is a sea of yellow and blue with all the Mortâ€”uh, goblins, so hammer on that. And honestly, if the players have a clever reason for coming up with other combinations, just tell them they did great and move along.</p>

<p>To help Tommy, a character must read his notes (taking 1 hour of study), then succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check to determine the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flabulator (one of those incomprehensibly named parts) must be connected to the chronomiton (ditto). This requires the flabulator to be the target of a spell that causes a creature to regain hit points, such as <wc-fetch type=spell>cure wounds</wc-fetch>. Drenching the flabulator in a <wc-fetch type=item>potion of healing</wc-fetch> also works.</li>
<li>The gleep-freeble mechanism must be calibrated by targeting it with a fire-based spell, such as the <wc-fetch type=spell>fire bolt</wc-fetch> cantrip.</li>
<li>The drockle-spreem tube needs to be carefully primed by being targeted by any ranged spell attack or the <wc-fetch type=spell>magic missile</wc-fetch> spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these tasks are completed, the churd cannon is fully operational and has one charge.</p>

Not only has the trap stolen countless butts, it&rsquo;s also brainwashed Tommy&rsquo;s friends, who joined the Order of the Buttless.</p>
<p>If the characters agree to accompany Tommy, Greeble, and Flerp to complete their mission, Tommy entrusts the churd cannon to one party member with a solemn reminder: &ldquo;Remember. It&rsquo;s one shot for all the butts.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s unclear exactly what this means.</p>
<p>When the characters arrive at the butt room (<strong>area area 10</strong>), there&rsquo;s a 75 percent chance that they encounter the Order of the Buttless there unless that group has been <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> in some way (see <strong>area area 32</strong>). The buttless have caught wind of Tommy Two-Butts&rsquo;s plan and intend to stop his blasphemy. The characters might well have to choose sides between Tommy Two-Butts or the Buttless.</p>

On any roll other than a 1, the cannon destroys the Butt Trap in a blinding flash. See area 10 for details on what happens afterward.</p>
<p>If the player rolls a 1, each creature in the room must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or lose their butt to the butt trap. The churd cannon then falls apart with a pathetic farting sound.</p>

They consider it a sign from their god and they rejoice, sure to mark this as a high holiday that they observe in perpetuity. Tommy Two-Butts hails the party as heroes and reconnects with his former friends.</p>
<p>If the butt trap is not destroyed, the Order of the Buttless continue spreading their old-time religion, and Tommy Two-Butts goes back to the drawing board.</p>

Commercial Room</h3><p>This is one of those rooms that&rsquo;s probably a lot bigger on the inside than it looks on the map. Cartographers, am I right? Anyway, read this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A long, empty table appears to be the star of some bizarre spectacle in this room. Bright lights shine down on it, and just visible past the table are rows and rows of creatures staring at it with eager anticipation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a visible character enters this area, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve barely set foot in the room before you&rsquo;re blinded by a bright light and deafened by the sound of a raging river. Or wait&mldr; is that&mldr; applause?</p>
<p>It takes your eyes a moment to adjust, but you soon find yourself squinting into a magic spotlight hanging over rows of enthusiastic monsters. Their faces are masks of delight and relief. A hobgoblin beckons you to join her in the middle of the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hobgoblin continues to urge the characters to join her in the center of the spotlight. In Common, she bellows, &ldquo;Welcome to the finest dungeon entertainment this side of the staircase that led you down into the dungeon: the Spawn Sword Ship Hour! Monsters love commercials, and this show is entirely that: commercials!&rdquo; The crowd erupts into cheers. This sounds like a horrible premise for a show, to be honest, but monster life is probably pretty bleak.</p>

<ul>
<li>These monsters (twelve Goblin, eight Bugbear, six Orc, and five Zombie) are on break from guarding the dungeon, and they&rsquo;re unwinding by watching the show.</li>
<li>Spawn Sword Ship Hour is full of people performing commercials for products nobody needsâ€”least of all monsters guarding a dungeon.</li>
<li>The show&rsquo;s intended special guests bailed on Cla&rsquo;a&rsquo;a&rsquo;arg, so the characters need to fill in.</li>
<li>If the characters refuse to participate, all the monsters noted above attack them. (They actually won&rsquo;t, but Cla&rsquo;a&rsquo;a&rsquo;arg tells them otherwise.)</li>
<li>These monsters really love commercials, man.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cla&rsquo;a&rsquo;a&rsquo;arg yells out, &ldquo;Are you ready?!&rdquo; before anyone is truly ready. She then whips out an object and slams it on the table before the characters. The audience gasps. Roll on the Irresistible Objects table to discover what wondrous wares the characters are now expected to sell to a bunch of intensely bored monsters.</p>

Ooze Cult Room</h3><p>Even before they reach the door leading into this room, the characters notice that the floor, ceiling, and walls of the corridor adjacent to the door are moist and glistening. When you describe it, really draw out the word &ldquo;moist.&rdquo; It makes people pretty uncomfortable.</p>
<p>As the characters get close to the door, they see a pitiful dude embroiled in some serious inner turmoil stuff regarding his life decisions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t hold your hand forever, but for now, read this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beside a closed wooden door, you see a middle-aged man sitting with his back to the wall and his knees drawn up under his chin. He&rsquo;s a real sad sack, sitting there in a rumpled yellow suit. To be clear, the suit is of fine quality, but there&rsquo;s only so much you can do with a guy like this.</p>
<p>Light catches a lone tear rolling down his cheek. He lifts a flask to his lips, drains the contents, then stares at himself in the flask&rsquo;s reflective surface. After a moment, he slurs, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve made a terrible mistake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guy is Borkibok, and he&rsquo;s a cultist. If the characters give him a chance, he talks their ears off about midlife-crisis anxieties regarding choice, regret, broken dreamsâ€”you definitely know the script. Borkibok fell in with his cult twenty years ago, and he thinks now that he might have wasted his life.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of moaning, Borkibok takes a deep breath and vomits. Like <em>reeeeally</em> vomits. It&rsquo;s all mucusy and mustard colored, and it just keeps coming. Kind of impressive, honestly. When he&rsquo;s finally done, he stares as the whole messy pile starts to move on its own under the door and into the as-yet-unseen room beyond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Borkibok says after a moment of watching his own vomit amble away. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you about the treasure, right? I&rsquo;m not supposed to tell anyone there&rsquo;s treasure in there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characters can choose to enter the room or to turn around and go back the way they came. There&rsquo;s no right answer here.</p>

If the characters decide to follow the vomit into the room, read this description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five cultists bend over the railing of a balcony that rings the room, seriously vomiting. They vomit with true conviction, and it&rsquo;s pooling in the middle of the floor.</p>
<p>As the foul pool begins to move, you are stricken with the thought that maybe the cultist in the corridor was right. Maybe all existenceâ€”everything that is, was, and will beâ€”has just been a tremendous waste of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The goo is an ochre jelly, backed by five Cultist. Once they notice the characters, they all attack. However, the cultists are still recovering from vomiting, so they&rsquo;re <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>. At the start of each of its turns, a cultist must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or remain <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>If Borkibok is still alive, he attacks the party from behind. He&rsquo;s a cultist after all, and duping rubes is kind of his jam.</p>

<p>If Borkibok is still alive, he&rsquo;s so overcome with reverence for his goo god that he attacks the characters. The other five cultists in the room follow the ochre jelly and join the fight after 2 rounds of combat.</p>

Pirate Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun so far, folks, but this next room is truly horrifying. Near darkness fills the room, and the sound of gently sloshing water echoes off the walls. A rowboat bobs in a slow-moving stream, tied by a rope to a small concrete pier. The horrid, oily water flowing in the stream looks suspiciously like pancreatic juice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room is illuminated only by dim light. The oily water fills the stream to a depth of 3 feet where it runs a winding course through this area. The stream is just wide enough to accommodate the rowboat.</p>

If the rope is unfastened, the boat floats down the dark, spooky stream at a rate of 10 feet per round. As the boat moves, the walls flash with bright images: a parrot, a doubloon, a treasure map! The dread is palpable.</p>
<p>If any players decide to crack wise about how &ldquo;pirates aren&rsquo;t scary,&rdquo; tell them each of their characters needs to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a permanent fear of pirates, forcibly making them the most sensible person in the party.</p>

If they&rsquo;re too frightened to continueâ€”trust me, I understandâ€”they can bail out of the boat and leave through this door. The oily water is uncomfortably warm but safe to traverse.</p>

Read the following in your spookiest ghost-story voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You find yourself gazing into a cavern of nightmares. Magically animated pirate mannequins act out their twisted follies. Some clank mugs together, others sit atop barrels and belt out demonic shanties, and still others play keep-away with a stolen peg leg. It&rsquo;s mayhem of the worst kind: piratical!</p>
<p>At the prow of a horrible wooden ship stands a mannequin wearing a large, terrifying pirate hat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the characters are noticed, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mannequin turns with unnatural speed to stare at you, and your boat grinds to a halt. &ldquo;Ahoy, me hearties!&rdquo; its voice booms. &ldquo;Answer me riddle or I&rsquo;ll scuttle ye!&rdquo;</p>

It&rsquo;s a Large object with AC 17, 50 hit points, a speed of 0 feet, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It has the following ability scores: Strength 14, Dexterity 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1 (obviously). It has <wc-fetch type=sense>blindsight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 30 feet and is blind beyond this distance. As an action, the captain can make a ranged weapon attack (+5 to hit, range 30 feet, one target) with the ship&rsquo;s fake (not really fake) cannon. On a hit, the cannon deals 3 (<wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p>If the characters ask the animatronic pirate captain its name, it tells them, &ldquo;Captain A-Hole&rdquo; (emphasis on the A). After any other initial pleasantries or tea-and-crumpets crap, A-Hole rattles off its crappy riddle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Arrrr! A landlubber has a barrel full of gold coins that weighs five hundred pounds. Then he puts something in the barrel, and ho! Now it weighs less than five hundred pounds! What did he put in the barrel, ye dogs?&rdquo;</p>

</span></p>
<p>The answer is &ldquo;a hole.&rdquo; Maybe now you understand why this guy is horrible.</p>
<p>If the characters successfully answer the riddle, the captain&rsquo;s mouth slowly opens into a supernatural screaming shape. A black cloth object flies out of it, landing neatly between the characters. See &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; later in this section for details.</p>
<p>If the characters tank the riddle and you get sick of waiting for the right answer, the construct captain shoots a cannon from the deck of its dumb ship and sinks the rowboat. Now the characters have to slog to the exit, and their pants and shoes are all wet.</p>
<p>After the riddle bulls**t is resolved, the boat floats onward to an exit beyond the pirate cavern, ending at a landing with a unlocked door.</p>

It&rsquo;s not, though. It&rsquo;s just a crunchy fabric patch slathered with some newfangled ultra black paintâ€”and it smells like pirate. Balled in it is 1 pp, though. The coin also smells like pirate, yet, somehow, that doesn&rsquo;t decrease the value.</p>

Clone Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>This room is totally, completely, and suspiciously empty. The only visible feature is the exit door on the other side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The door on the opposite side of the empty room can&rsquo;t be opened by any means unless all the characters have entered this area. Once this happens, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The far door opens, and an identical party of adventurers enters, eyeing you suspiciously. It&rsquo;s not a cursed mirror or whateverâ€”I&rsquo;m not a damn hackâ€”these are identical versions of <em>you</em>. In the interest of efficiency, I sent another dimension&rsquo;s version of you into the dungeon right when you started. Admittedly, this meeting is pretty awkward, but I&rsquo;m sure we can sort it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry too much about the fact that you&rsquo;ve got four other characters to roleplay here. It&rsquo;s real simple: the new characters are the same as the players' characters, right? So they behave the same way. Anytime one of the original characters says or does something in this room, their clone-self does something almost identical. An important note is that these clones are not evil. They&rsquo;re just alternative versions of the originals.</p>

It should be obvious what&rsquo;s happening, but have the players roll initiative to hammer it home.</p>
<p>The clones can all go on the same initiative count, but they otherwise use the same statistics as their character doubles. Maybe make a big show of asking to review each player&rsquo;s character sheet, then pretend to chuckle over strategies the player never noticed or gear maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t have. If your players whine about not wanting to murder themselves, just repeat solemnly, &ldquo;There can only be one.&rdquo; Have their clone declare that <em>they</em> intend to make it out alive as they strike the first blow.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter who wins these fights. In fact, feel free to kill off a few of the characters.</p>
<p>Once the fog clears, one of each character is left standing. Is this the same merry band as before? It&rsquo;s impossible to know. If anyone is troubled by not knowing, have them roll a <wc-roll>d20</wc-roll> to see if they can figure it out. They can&rsquo;t. On a 20, the character perceives the vastness of the multiverse and the inconsequence of our tiny lives within.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another door for you. This one&rsquo;s made of indestructible magic metal-wood, because I have that kind of power. Anyway, it has one of those sliding peephole thingies in it, which is closed at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A flameskull is trapped in this room. The door here isn&rsquo;t lockedâ€”it&rsquo;s just very heavy, and the flameskull&rsquo;s a weak-ass floating skull. It has no hands, and the magic one it can conjure is pathetic. So the little guy&rsquo;s stuck.</p>
<h4 id=flame-on>

The little guy was floating there on the other side of the door with its empty eye sockets pressed up against the peephole. After the blast, the flameskull is all apologetic, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All you can see through the peephole is a skeletal mouth chattering away. In a froggy voice, it says, &ldquo;Oh lordy, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I&rsquo;m just so nervous. Oh lordy. I hope y&rsquo;all aren&rsquo;t hurt or scared or discomforted or, oh lordy, dead, oh no. I was so startled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skeletal thing backs off, and you can see it&rsquo;s just a skull yapping away. It&rsquo;s wreathed in flames, and its eye sockets contain small orbs of fire. The room beyond the peephole is covered with hundreds of metal spikes poking out from the walls toward the center. Some of the spikes on the floor have skulls mounted on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trapped in here for forever, it seems. Isn&rsquo;t that right, Andy? Could y&rsquo;all help us?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andy, it would appear, is one of the skulls mounted on a spike. This flameskull is lonely and more than a little crazy, and Andy is clearly its best friend.</p>

<p>The flameskull wants out of this room. It can&rsquo;t open the door, but a character can open it with a successful DC 17 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. However, as soon as anyone enters the room, the heavy door slams shut behind them. Yeah! More slamming doors! It&rsquo;s still unlocked, but it&rsquo;s also still really heavy.</p>
<p>Once the door is open, the flameskull immediately casts <wc-fetch type=spell>mage hand</wc-fetch>, scoops up Andy the skull, and peaces out. As the skulls pass by the party, a glass vial drops out of Andy&rsquo;s empty eye socket. Anyone can try to catch it with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Acrobatics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>If nobody catches it, it smashes on the ground, and there goes your free potion (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). If the characters leave the flameskull alone, it proceeds to the nearest room with goblins (probably <strong>area area 20</strong>) and starts murdering everyone it can see. It&rsquo;s a flameskull. Evil is real in this world, and this fella&rsquo;s super evil.</p>

<p>The monster, a spectator, doesn&rsquo;t attack. As soon as any of the characters tries to speak, rudely interrupt them with a telepathic communication from this budget beholder.

<p>Anyway, half or more of the characters must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Performance</wc-fetch>) check, but they better be coordinated. None of that &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dance, you juggle, and Fantasy Carol can do card tricks&rdquo; garbage. This ain&rsquo;t a middle school talent show.</p>
<p>If the group succeeds, the spectator grunts in approval and vanishes through a hole in the ceiling that promptly opens before it, promptly closes after it, and can&rsquo;t be found again. At the same time, a previously unseen trapdoor appears in the floor of the room. The trapdoor is unlocked and opens up to a small cubbyhole.</p>

<p>A treasure chest sits innocently atop a pedestal in the center of an otherwise empty room. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the whole room description for this one. Looks like this is just a nice reward for all your hard work.</p>

<p>Psych! It&rsquo;s a mimic. It&rsquo;s <em>always</em> a mimic. As soon as a character moves within 5 feet of the pedestal, a big sticky purple tongue bursts out of the chest and it&rsquo;s go time.</p>
<p>This mimic has only 15 hit points when the fight starts, so it&rsquo;s not so bad. But wait! There&rsquo;s more!</p>

<ul>
<li>The mimic is Large and has 20 hit points remaining (of its usual 75).</li>
<li>As an action, it can make three attacks: two with its pseudopods and one with its bite.</li>
<li>The mimic is lodged in the floor, so its speed is 0 feet.</li>

Virus Room</h3><p>Read the following to set the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A massive disembodied humanoid head hovers above the floor. The bottom of its neck is capped with some kind of metal device. It appears to be muttering to itself, but what it&rsquo;s saying sounds like gibberish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who draws close can see that the device at the base of the head&rsquo;s neck is a series of pipes and tubes connecting to a glowing furnace. A clumsy series of gears and wheels grinds loudly from inside the device, which coughs up weak plumes of smoke.</p>
<p>As the characters stare in awe, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the furnace glows brighter, the head begins to speak more clearly. Which is to say, its gibberish only gets louder. &ldquo;Mumford. Potato. Spelling. Casper. Igneous.&rdquo; It sounds as though it&rsquo;s listing words, and now it starts to yell. A piercing hiss comes from beneath the pipes and tubes under the head, and a bunch of thin strips of parchment suddenly shoot forth.</p>
<p>From the dark corners of the room, four giant spiders suddenly rush up in a kind of worshipful reverence. One skitters up to you and shoves the parchment strips in your collective faces. &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; it chitters. &ldquo;To self, not loud.&rdquo;</p>

Or maybe they were invisible. Whatever. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t need the characters killing everything as soon as they see it.</p>
<p>The number of parchment strips conveniently equals the number of characters. At this point, you can convey individual messages to any characters who read the parchments given to them by the spiders (see &ldquo;Getting Ahead&rdquo; below). You can write the notes on scraps of paper and hand them out, drag individual people out of the room and tell them, whisper it to them like a gossipy middle schooler, or do whatever else that can drive this info into the players' oblong heads.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the catch, though. Each character who reads a parchment must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or contract a visual virus that forces them to obey the note. Each infected character must adhere to their parchment&rsquo;s command as strictly as possible.</p>

<li>You are under attack. No one here can be trusted except for the head.</li>
<li>You <em>really</em> love the head. No one is allowed to approach the head. Keep others away at all costs.</li>
<li>This head is unnatural. It makes you sick. Just what does it think it&rsquo;s doing? Kill the head.</li>
<li>Everyone&rsquo;s being weird except you. You know that not everyone received the same message. The head has something to do with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters under the effect of commands that compel them to remain in the room can willingly leave this area only after the head is destroyed. The head is a Large object with AC 17, 50 hit points, a speed of 0 feet, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It has the following ability scores: Strength 14, Dexterity 3, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 10.

<p>If a character is determined to be the messiah, they are welcomed with a clanging of tins and pots, a jubilant song, dried slug chips, and fried rat delicacies. From that moment on, the Order of the Buttless sees the character as a god and does whatever the character commands.</p>
<p>If a character is deemed &ldquo;not the messiah&rdquo; and all other buttless characters are ruled out, then the buttless begin evangelizing the virtues of their god. The buttless are not hostile to the party unless the characters prove aggressive or show disrespect within the chapel.</p>

Nothic Room</h3><p>Remember when you mentioned in area 32 that the door into this area is unusually short? It&rsquo;s a safe bet the players don&rsquo;t. No memory for important details, these people. Unless someone announces that they&rsquo;re stooping down as they go through the door, when the first Medium or larger character enters this room, they must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check or take 1 point of bludgeoning damage as they bonk their dome.</p>
<p>Read the following to any survivors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mist obscures the floor, curling around your ankles. This was probably once a torture room, but everything here is busted up. Pieces of classic equipment like iron maidens and stretching racks litter the floor, alongside up-and-comers like the inside-outer and the bone dissolver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A nothic with a <wc-fetch type=item>concertina</wc-fetch> (a less charming kind of accordion) waits here, concealed behind an overturned torture chair. The creature has been drinking heavily and is already pretty wrecked. When the party interrupts its stupor by showing up, the unseen nothic plays a tuneâ€”something like, &ldquo;Naaaa na na na na na na naaaa nana.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not Mozart, but you get the gist.</p>
<p>The concertina is a rare magic item. In addition to knocking out a killer polka, a creature playing the concertina can use an action to cause an area of mist or water up to 30 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep to freeze solid. Once used, this feature of the concertina can&rsquo;t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<p>At the end of the tune and before any characters move too close, the nothic uses the magic concertina to cause the mist on the floor to turn to solid ice. Any creatures touching the floor must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> by the ice. (The nothic hops up at just the right time.) As an action, a character can attempt to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ice, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. A character freed from the ice is no longer <wc-fetch type=condition>restrained</wc-fetch> by it. The ice melts in an hour if everyone in the party turns out to be helpless baby birds.</p>

Lay down the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hunched, one-eyed creature shambles out from hiding behind some torture stuff. It levels a concertina menacingly. &ldquo;Me gonna stir up some s***,&rdquo; it hisses with unmistakable glee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nothic uses its Weird Insight ability to yank a juicy tidbit from one of the player&rsquo;s minds. That&rsquo;s right, not the character, the player, which is sure to shake up the group&rsquo;s harmonious dynamic. Roll a <wc-roll>d4</wc-roll> and consult the following insight tables for each player to determine what information the nothic gains based on which character it looks at. The nothic then shares that private thought with the whole group.</p>
<p>If the nothic isn&rsquo;t stopped, it continues to hunt for insights and share them with the group. Fun! Aside from killing it, the only way to shut it up is to give it a magic item. Any magic item suffices. It&rsquo;s a greedy bastard.</p>

Frankie Freem&rsquo;s Room</h3><p>This room is way bigger on the inside than it should be, because it&rsquo;s got some weird interdimensional s*** going on. Get ready to blow some minds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This room&rsquo;s one of those chain restaurants that looks like a wacky tavern with all kinds of bright lights and kitschy crap on the walls. Numerous patrons cower at their tables. Could the appetizers really be that bad?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When any character enters the area in plain view, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An animatronic iguana wearing overalls and a straw hat comes over and says, &ldquo;Hi! Welcome to Frankie Freem&rsquo;s! Y&rsquo;all need a drink?&rdquo; She&rsquo;s trying to be, like, some kind of southern belle and is carrying a guitar. Except she&rsquo;s a lizard and her name tag reads &ldquo;Layla.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iguana is Layla the Lizard (see &ldquo;Automatons&rdquo; below). Frankie Freem&rsquo;s is a tavern demiplane that, once entered, doesn&rsquo;t allow anyone to exit until the happy hour known as the Slaughterfest. That&rsquo;s the time when the tavern&rsquo;s staff ruthlessly murder the patrons, who are then brought back to life to repeat the same hijinks the next day.</p>
<p>The characters need to figure out that the only way out of the tavern is to destroy all the constructs during the Slaughterfest. Characters attempting to exit Frankie Freem&rsquo;s before this time find that the doors are magically sealed and can&rsquo;t be opened or damaged.</p>
<h4 id=patrons>

Some stare off into space, others hide under tables, and some occupy makeshift forts. There are fifteen patrons here, ten of whom won&rsquo;t participate in any scuffles that break out, as they&rsquo;re too old, too young, or too catatonic.</p>
<p>These traumatized patrons collectively know quite a bit about the nature of their prison. Any patron the characters question knows and shares one of the following tidbits of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>People come into the restaurant from all over the multiverse. Once they enter, they can&rsquo;t leave.</li>
<li>No one can die here.</li>
<li>Every twelve hours, the automatons announce the Slaughterfest and begin killing everyone in the restaurant. After the last patron is killed, everyone comes back to life without a scratchâ€”but with full memory of their violent deaths.</li>
<li>One woman and her young son say that they were the first ones here, having arrived three weeks ago. The son now just rocks back and forth, gazing into the middle distance.</li>
<li>The automatons can be destroyed, but they somehow always manage to kill all the patrons first.</li>
<li>The food and service here are great.</li>
</ul>

</span></p>
<p>The five automatons that serve as the tavern&rsquo;s wait staff all speak and understand Common. They are immune to poison and psychic damage as well as the following conditions: <wc-fetch type=condition>blinded</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>charmed</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>deafened</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>frightened</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>paralyzed</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch>, and <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>Each automaton has a name tag, is super friendly to the patrons, and attends to everyone&rsquo;s needs until it comes time for the Slaughterfest. If an automaton is attacked before the Slaughterfest, it giggles and repeats folksy homilies until it is destroyed. The next round, it magically pops back to life fully healed, then asks, &ldquo;What can I do for ya?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the characters spend time in the tavern, they&rsquo;ll eventually encounter each of the following automatons, which use the indicated stat blocks:</p>
<p>Billy Beaver (owlbear) is a goofy, owlbear-sized beaver with a raccoon-skin cap, playing a washboard and spoons. He has 34 hit points and has neither the Multiattack nor Claws action option.</p>
<p>Buster the Bear (bugbear) is a lovable, roly-poly teddy bear with a plaid shirt, torn jeans, and a banjo. Replace Buster&rsquo;s action options with the Bashin' Banjo action option described below.</p>

The lights go out, sirens wail, and strobe lights flash. All the automatons then begin singing a catchy Slaughterfest song as they attack everyone in the restaurant.</p>
<p>For the characters, the rules of the Slaughterfest are simple: destroy the automatons. If they do, the lights come back on, any recently killed patrons come back to life, and everyone is free to leave. Passing through either door returns all the other patrons to their home dimensions and gets the characters back to the dungeon.</p>
<p>If the automatons kill the characters (after which they kill all the patrons), the clock is reset, everyone comes back to life, and the automatons go back to providing fantastic service in a family-friendly atmosphere.</p>

So any restaurant is pretty much a death trap where you&rsquo;re expected to tip. If the characters want to find cooking oil or bottles of alcohol and set them aflame, go for it! Doing so nets them <wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll> improvised ranged weapons. Likewise, if the characters want to create walls and choke points from dining tables, great!

These guests have all been traumatized by dying again and again, but the sturdiest among them might be convinced to die for a reason next time. Up to five patrons can be convinced to aid the party, though each must be personally wooed with a successful DC 12 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check.

Treasure Treats Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>This room looks a whole lot like the movie about that weirdo with the candy factory. That scene with all the kids, where the one gets sucked up the pipeâ€”remember that? It&rsquo;s like that, but with gold pieces and treasure everywhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a massive treasure chest perched on a toadstool in one corner of the room. The chest is made of wood. The toadstool is made of sapphires. A geyser of gold and platinum coins cascades from a fountain in the wall, forming a makeshift river of fortune that bisects the room.</p>
<p>A bridge across the river is made of diamonds, and trees along its banks are glittering rubies. Gorgeous emerald meadows cover the rest of the room, littered with flowers crafted from a pearlescent white material. Probably pearl, all things considered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Encourage the characters to go nuts in here. Swim around! Load their pockets! It&rsquo;s all there for the taking. This room rules, and the characters are free to spend as much time here as they like.</p>
<p>The chest in the corner is the only thing in the room not made from gems or precious metals. Unless you consider birch a precious metalâ€”in which case, you&rsquo;d be wrong. If any character interacts with the treasure chest, it eagerly opens. &ldquo;Take this with my blessing!&rdquo; the chest proclaims. Whoa, it&rsquo;s a talking treasure chest! Roll on the Free Treasure table to determine what&rsquo;s inside.</p>

As each character steps through, they hear a sinister laugh. Any character that took treasure from this roomâ€”including the gold dropped by the orange weirdosâ€”feels that treasure disappear.</p>
<p>By the time the laughter fades, all the characters' treasure is gone. By which I mean, if they gained any treasure in the dungeon, it&rsquo;s gone. Each character who tried to steal from this room discovers that they now have a poorly done tribal tattoo around their left bicep. You can read the following to drive home the shame:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you, stupid? You can&rsquo;t just take that stuff. You&rsquo;re like that shitty grandpa who made his family do all the work. Is this metaphor effective at all? I just wanted to give you stuff and take it away to make you sad. Gygax Riiiick!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If any of the characters wisely avoided taking the treasure in the room, read the following to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see you&rsquo;ve resisted the temptation of material wealth. Well done, but you should understand that money is the only thing that talks in this world, so enjoy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When the characters open the door, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, what the f***? I didn&rsquo;t put this room here, so which one of you clowns did? Now listen, you think it&rsquo;s funny to mess with rickety old grandpa Rick, but I have WAY more good years left than any of you do, soâ€”Hey, who the hell are <em>you</em>? What is this? You can&rsquo;t justâ€”get your hands off me! Where are you takingâ€”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pause for dramatic effect, then read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry about how mean this dungeon has been so far. This is a nice room. Shafts of golden light filter in from some unknown source. Hundreds of butterflies flit gently across the room, sometimes landing on beautiful flowers growing out of the walls and floor. Somewhere in the ceiling, speakers play soothing new-agey music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room stands apart from the rest of the dungeonâ€”as though it was designed by an entirely different person.</p>

Fun Skeleton Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>As you draw nearer to this room, you hear the sounds of rattling bones. Not in a spooky wayâ€”in a fun way!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the characters can see into the room, read this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of skeletons appears to be examining something set up on a stand between them, but you can&rsquo;t quite see what it is. Bone-crafted sculptures adorn the room. Or wait&mldr; is that one sculpture actually a drum set?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the skeletons spot the characters, read some more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the skeletons spots you and gestures wildly, beckoning you to come over. The other skeletons look over and also start gesturing. It&rsquo;s just fun skeletons!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The five Skeleton in this room don&rsquo;t attackâ€”because they&rsquo;re fun skeletons. Once the characters move closer, it&rsquo;s clear the skeletons are crowded around a xylophone made of bonesâ€”a xylobone! The skeletons can&rsquo;t play it, though, because each of them already has an instrument.</p>

The skeletons beckon to the other characters, encouraging them to play other instruments. Once everyone is in place, the bone jam session begins! Have each character playing an instrument make a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Performance</wc-fetch>) check. If all the characters succeed, the jam session sounds amazing! If any of the characters fail, one of the skeletons comes over to wordlessly give advice on how to play better. Have that character make the check again. If they succeed, the skeleton rejoices. If they fail again, the skeleton gently takes the instrument, exchanging it for something the character can&rsquo;t f*** upâ€”like bone maracas or a skull toot-jug.</p>

Mama Owlbear Room</h3><p>As the party approaches this room, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A distinctively earthy smell wafts toward you as you approach the door ahead. You hear snuffling and snorting, and an occasional vexed grumbling sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters enter this room, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This odiferous room is overflowing with piles of hay, long branches, and dozens of bones picked clean of meat. Feathers have formed downy beds where they&rsquo;ve drifted into the dim corners of the room. A particularly large pile of hay emits the snuffling sound heard before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the characters move close enough to investigate the noises coming from the pile of hay, an enormous face emerges. It looks as though it belongs to a barn owl the size of a draft horse, so of course it&rsquo;s actually an owlbear. The head tilts to view the characters, then swivels over an impossibly wide arc from side to side. It slowly extracts itself from its pile of hay, revealing the rest of its snowy-white ursine body. A ruff of iridescent feathers marks it as a particularly majestic female. She snuffles the air in the characters' direction and gives a warm grunt.</p>
<p>The owlbear won&rsquo;t initiate an attack against the party, and even ignores a round of harassment if characters attack her. Only if the characters continue their assault does the owlbear grudgingly defend herself.</p>
<p>The one major issue, though, is that her nest is blocking the exit into the next room.</p>
<h4 id=empty-nest-syndrome>

</span></p>
<p>This owlbear had her babies stolen by nasty, mean old Rick for use as monsters in another of his dungeons. She just happened to have as many cublets as there are members of the party, and she misses her wayward offspring terribly. She attempts to make this clear by presenting her hatched eggs to the party and moaning.</p>
<p>To placate her, the entire party must assuage her grieving maternal instinct. How they do so is up to them, but the easiest way is to disguise themselves as owlbear cublets (using feathers and clumps of fur, easily found in the nest) and get cozy with their new mom. This delights the owlbear, who immediately ushers them into the nest and grooms them thoroughly with her razor-sharp beak. The experience is actually quite pleasant.</p>
<p>Once this is complete, the owlbear falls asleep contentedly in her nest. A successful DC 10 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check allows each character to escape through the exit without waking her up. If a character fails the check, the sleeping owlbear rolls over and traps the character under her considerable weight. A successful DC 15 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check is required to escape.</p>
<p>The owlbear wakes back up only if the party makes a truly apocalyptic amount of noise, giving characters plenty of opportunity to free trapped companions. If the owlbear does wake up, she grumbles, repeats the grooming process, then goes back to sleep.</p>

Boss Room</h3><p>This is the end game. If anyone has anything they wanted to get off their chest, they should probably deal with it now. Then read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even from a distance, it&rsquo;s easy to see that this room wasn&rsquo;t intended to be easily accessed. Chunks of stone and wood lie strewn outside the door, which is riddled with broken locks. Magic wards sizzle ineffectively, their power reduced to nothing.</p>
<p>At the same time, warm rays of light beckon you inside. You feel pushed toward the roomâ€”which might be due to the floor beginning to gently tilt toward the battered doorway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lifting floor is only there to get the characters moving. There are no traps still active on this door, and no tricks await the characters when they enter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A simple wooden table bearing a small, squarish cloth-covered object sits in the middle of the room. Patterns of scintillating green stones cover the floor and walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check made to study the walls or floor realizes that the green stones take the shape of a green dragon, its wings climbing the walls and its torso tiled on the ground.</p>
<p>If a character approaches the table, read this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, yes, it is a delicious mystery, isn&rsquo;t it? You feel that only good things hide beneath the cloth. It&rsquo;s going to feel so nice to pull off that cloth. You take a moment to feel grateful for your opposable thumbs, which allow you to pull cloths off things on tables! How lucky you are!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id=what-lies-beneath>

The remains of a disabled pressure plate reveal a mechanism that would have released a boulder from the ceiling, obliterating anyone inside the room. Real original, Rick.</p>
<p>Removing the cloth reveals a framed portrait of Rick, Beth, Summer, and Morty, smiling widely. A Jerry-shaped hole has been cut out of the portrait. As soon as the characters realize what it is, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s it?! This is what he had locked up so tight in here? Rick&rsquo;s weakness is his family? Absolutely impossible. He doesn&rsquo;t even <em>like</em> them!</p>
<p>Wait&mldr; they look an awful lot like&mldr; all of <em>you</em>. Well, that makes this easy.</p>
</blockquote>

</span></p>
<p>The green stones around the characters begin to shake, ripping themselves out of the floor and walls. Each creature in the room must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked <wc-fetch type=condition>prone</wc-fetch>. The stones regroup themselves into the form of a snarling young green dragon. It&rsquo;s initiative time, b**ches. Curiously, if Jerry is playing, his character is completely immune to the dragon&rsquo;s attacks.</p>

A successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check allows a character to recognize the form as Rick Sanchez himself, dressed in wizardly garb and clearly <wc-fetch type=condition>unconscious</wc-fetch>.</p>
<p>For the first round of combat, getting Rick to wake up or pay attention is impossible. It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s not even in his body at all. At the start of the second round of combat, his eyes snap open and focus on the green dragon. &ldquo;RICK HAS REGAINED CONTROL, B**CHES!&rdquo; he yells triumphantly. Roll Rick&rsquo;s initiative. Just wing his modifier. It&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<h4 id=dungeons-is-dragons>

Rick has AC 17 and 138 hit points. He automatically takes half damage from the dragon&rsquo;s attacks even without making saving throws. On each of his turns, Rick casts <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=spell>lightning bolt</wc-fetch>. He&rsquo;ll be doing the heavy lifting for a few rounds, is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>That said, when the dragon is close to getting finished off (like, maybe it&rsquo;s got 30 hit points left?), have its next attack arbitrarily and dramatically send Rick to the ground. Oh no! Drama! It&rsquo;s all up to the characters to finish this fight!</p>
<p>After the dragon is defeated, let the characters give Rick some healing or slap him back to consciousness. Then read this final description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m in control! Hell yeah, dawgs, I&rsquo;m back! Gygax Riiiick!</p>
<p>All of you look around at the carnage and think, &ldquo;Wow, Rick was the true hero all along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long story short, I let myself get captured by a real piece-of-s*** multidimensional entity (and not that you asked, but its name is Chad). It&rsquo;s been horny to capture me and put my brain in a jar for, like, twenty years now. Thanks to your distraction, I sabotaged its WHOLE s*** and sent it spiraling back through the last few dozen dimensions it&rsquo;s wormed its way through. So needless to say, it won&rsquo;t be bothering me again anytime soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rick looks extremely satisfied with himself. At least until rocks start falling from the ceiling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, right. We do have about thirty seconds to get out of here before everything comes crumbling down and we end up trapped here for eternity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rick removes an ingenious-looking piece of technology from his robes and points it toward a wall. A sickly green portal appears. As he runs toward it, he calls to the party:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last one out is a rotten ee-<em>BURP</em>-eeegg!</p>
</blockquote>

Those who don&rsquo;t exit the dungeon find themselves crushed to death almost immediately, and they die in real life. But thankfully only in a particular dimension that isn&rsquo;t this one. Lucky!</p>
<p>If you want to keep playing as these terrific and timeless characters, strap in: it&rsquo;s time for the upsell. Go pick up the Player&rsquo;s Handbook, the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide, and the Monster Manual from your favorite book retailer or friendly local game store. If the characters had unfinished business in this dungeon or didn&rsquo;t have a chance to explore it all before Rick heroically saved their asses, let them go back for another shot at it. And if you&rsquo;re looking for more premade adventure content, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Tomb of Horrors (found in the adventure anthology Tales from the Yawning Portal), but there&rsquo;s a ton of other great stuff out there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ready for this. I believe in you.</p>
<p>Here are some suggested topics for discussion as everyone reels from the great time they&rsquo;ve just had:</p>
<ul>
<li>How great the dungeon was</li>
<li>How well written it was</li>
<li>How much fun everyone had</li>
<li>Memories from the experience that each player will carry with them forever</li>
<li>How everyone wishes they could play D&D for a hundred years without stopping</li>
<li>How glad everyone is that <em>Rick and Morty</em> did this great crossover product</li>
<li>How everyone would love to play this great dungeon again sometime</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for enjoying this one-of-a-kind Dungeons & Dragons Rickth Edition experience. Rick out, broh!!!</p>
