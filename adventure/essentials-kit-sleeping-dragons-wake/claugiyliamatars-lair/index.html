Characters of any level that attempt to fight Claugiyliamatar head-on will likely meet their demise.</p>
<p>This quest does not appear on the Leilon quest board, but the party likely comes here after learning that Claugiyliamatar poses a threat at the Bronze Shrine (see &ldquo;Bronze Shrine&rdquo;).</p>

The dragon&rsquo;s long-term presence makes the cave a place of primal magic that causes nature to flourish. Dangerous fauna and flora guard Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s treasure hoard, which includes several <wc-fetch type=item>Crystal Ball</wc-fetch> and statues of powerful female humanoids.</p>
<p>A cabal of evil human druids revere Claugiyliamatar, calling themselves the Gnawbones. They live in the lair, caring for the cave&rsquo;s guardians and doing anything else the dragon demands. The druids have been on edge recently due to increasing undead attacks and the mounting frustration of Claugiyliamatar.</p>
<p>Each day more of Ularan Mortus&rsquo;s undead minions journey through Kryptgarden Forest and attack Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s lair. Though the dragon and her guardians dispatch the undead with ease, Claugiyliamatar has been unable to discover the source of the attacks. Ularan Mortus&rsquo;s goal is to weaken the dragon&rsquo;s mental state with anxiety and frustration so Chardansearavitriol the Ebondeath can possess Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s body. The necromancer put one of his lieutenants, an undead warlock named Viantha Cruelhex, in charge of organizing these assaults.</p>

<p>Through dense vines and foliage ahead, you can see a dancing flame surrounding a floating skull. Shadows move in the greenery nearby, indicating that the fiery being is not traveling alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Karanor, a flameskull created by Ularan Mortus, leads Ghoul to Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s lair. The number of ghouls present equals the number of characters in the party, not including sidekicks. When the undead notice the characters, they attack. Karanor does not reveal details of its mission unless magically compelled to do so. That said, the flameskull does not know the greater purpose of its mission, only that it has orders from Viantha Cruelhex to attack the lair.</p>

The cave has an earthy smell and is warm and humid. The following features are common throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Ceilings:</strong> The ceilings throughout the cave are 40 feet high.</p>
<p><strong>Light:</strong> Phosphorescent moss growing on the walls fills the caves with dim green light, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks that rely on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Stalagmites:</strong> Medium-sized stalagmites are found throughout the cave. When using these stalagmites for protection, a Medium or small creature gains half cover.</p>
<p><strong>Statues:</strong> Claugiyliamatar has collected statues of powerful female humanoids from places all over FaerÃ»n and placed them in her lair. Each statue is 10 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds. A character knows the figure a statue depicts with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p><strong>Trees:</strong> The trees outside of the lair are <wc-roll>1d6 + 10</wc-roll> feet tall and require no ability checks to climb.</p>
<p><strong>Walls:</strong> Wild vines grow on the cave&rsquo;s walls. Climbing the walls without equipment requires a successful DC 11 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few scattered pine trees stand before a vine-covered cliff. Two large cave openings, partly obscured by hanging greenery, are readily apparent in the cliff&rsquo;s face, one twenty feet high and the other forty feet high. Slightly north of these gaping openings, a much smaller cave entrance is level with the ground. A dim green glow radiates from all of the entrances.</p>
<p>Ten pikes set with skulls and rotting heads stand in a line before the cliff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wood Woad (see appendix A), plant guardians created from humanoid remains by Claugiyliamatar, hide behind vines and watch the nearby forest from <strong>area area C1</strong>. If the wood woads notice the characters attempting to enter the cave, they climb down and attack. There is one wood woad plus one additional wood woad per two members of the party (rounded down), not including sidekicks.</p>
<p>The cave entrance that leads to area C1 is 40 feet high. The cave entrance that leads to <strong>area area C4</strong> is 20 feet high. Climbing the walls of the cliff to reach either entrance requires a successful DC 11 Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check.</p>
<p>Each pike bears the head of a ghoul, skeleton, wight, or zombie. Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s servants placed these trophies as a warning, but the grisly display has done nothing to deter the undead attacks.</p>

The druids worship Claugiyliamatar as a god, and the dragon teaches them to cast spells.</p>
<p>The druids attack intruders on sight. A character can stop the druids' attacks by claiming to be allies of Claugiyliamatar and succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check made as an action. The druids lead characters they believe to be allies of Claugiyliamatar to the dragon (<strong>area area C13</strong>). If the characters capture a druid and makes a successful DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Intimidation</wc-fetch>) check the druid leads them to the dragon.</p>
<p>Characters could encounter the following four Gnawbones druids in the lair:</p>
<p><strong>Argina Therrow:</strong> The leader of the Gnawbones is a tall, thin human in her late sixties who covers herself in green body paint to honor Claugiyliamatar. The dragon devoured bandits attacking Argina when she was a young girl. Argina sees Claugiyliamatar as a savior of those who devote themselves to the dragon and is fanatical in her loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>Delis Venomcauldron:</strong> Delis is a middle-aged human with a shaved head and a face scarred with alchemical burns. She joined the Gnawbones after murdering her cruel husband with poison and fleeing civilization. The alchemist has a wicked sense of humor and an obsession with poisons.</p>
<p><strong>Saija Hurwi:</strong> Sajia joined the Gnawbones after hearing tales of Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s prowess with nature magic. The eighteen-year old human prefers the company of animals to people and often speaks of her desire to help beasts conquer FaerÃ»n.</p>
<p><strong>Zuri Kimyak:</strong> Zuri is a short woman in her twenties with wild black hair dyed with a streak of green. She joined the Gnawbones after learning she had a green dragon ancestor and feels a kinship with Claugiyliamatar. Except for dragons and her fellow Gnawbones, Zuri sees all other creatures as inferior and worthy of only distain.</p>

Owlbear Pens</h4><p>Two 10-foot-cubic iron cages stand in the north end of this cavern. Unless the druids from area C3 opened the cages to aid with a disturbance in area C1, each cage contains a sleeping owlbear. The cage doors are locked with latches on the outside, which can be undone or relocked as an action.</p>
<p>If the owlbears are freed, they attack the characters. If the owlbears are not in the presence of Claugiyliamatar or a Gnawbones druid, a character who uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Animal Handling</wc-fetch>) convinces the owlbear to stop attacking.

<p>Whenever a creature enters this cavern, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature is immune to the effect of the spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> for 1 minute. While <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch>, the creature is delirious and feels the need to frolic. At the start of its turn, the <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> creature rolls on the Frolic Direction table and moves its full speed in a direction indicated by the roll. The creature moves in a straight line that direction without regard for its own safety, stumbling into hazards and obstacles or over ledges. If a creature runs into a statue, stalagmite, or wall and still has movement left, the creature takes <wc-roll>1d6</wc-roll> bludgeoning damage per 10 feet of remaining movement (rounded down). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>

As long as the creature isn&rsquo;t completely submerged in the slime, it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. The DC is 12 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the slime. A creature fully submerged in slime can&rsquo;t breathe (see &ldquo;Suffocating&rdquo; in chapter 8 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook).</p>
<p>A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a slime pool by using its action and succeeding on a Strength (<wc-fetch type=skill>Athletics</wc-fetch>) check. The DC is 7 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk into the slime.</p>
<p>A creature that comes into contact with the slime takes 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) acid damage. The creature takes this damage again at the start of each of its turns until the slime is scraped off or destroyed.</p>

Map Room</h4><p>Read the following boxed text aloud to describe this area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vines on the north and south walls of this cavern form almost perfect circles around twenty-foot-diameter patches of moss. The oddly glowing green growth on the north wall depicts a city map, and the south wall displays a map of the Sword Coast. Both maps are dotted with Draconic runes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s magical connection to her lair allows her to control the moss in this room to keep track of her various humanoid spies along the Sword Coast. She has a separate map for Waterdeep, where most of her machinations take place. A character who has been to Waterdeep or who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check knows that the north map depicts the city.</p>
<p>A character who understands Draconic knows that each rune is a single letter of the Draconic alphabet. Each depicted rune is different from the others and represents a different agent working for the dragon. There are no runes near Leilon. In addition to Waterdeep, Claugiyliamatar has agents in the cities of Luskan, Baldur&rsquo;s Gate, Neverwinter, and Elturel.</p>

Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s Cavern</h4><p>Claugiyliamatar spends most of her time in this cavern, looking into her <wc-fetch type=item>Crystal Ball</wc-fetch> to find the source of the undead that attack her lair. When the characters enter this area and can see the green dragon, read the following boxed text aloud to describe this area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small puffs of foul-smelling green gas emit from the nostrils of a titanic dragon with dull olive scales. The tips of her massive wings and the edges of the frills along her head and spine are black with age beyond mortal reason. She stares into four glowing crystal balls, her serpentine face curled into a wicked scowl around a humanoid femur bone poking out between her teeth. Attacking such a powerful being would almost surely result in your demise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claugiyliamatar is an ancient green dragon of immense power. You can find her stats in Appendix A: Creatures.</p>

The shrewd dragon immediately suspects that the characters are not allied with the undead attacking her lair and believes she might be able to put them to work finding answers for her, especially since they bested her lair&rsquo;s defenses to reach her.</p>
<p>Claigiyliamatar is jealous of powerful female humanoids who get to participate in the backstabbing, intrigue, and machinations of political nobility. Before she asks the characters why they have come to her lair, she demands that they state where they come from, then demands to hear any gossip or rumors the characters might know from the Sword Coast. If the characters can offer a salacious tidbit (such as rumors about the ghosts of the Swords of Leilon or the people rebuilding the town) and a successful DC 15 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check, or they succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Deception</wc-fetch>) check to offer a fake rumor, the dragon asks them why they have come to her lair. If the characters mention one of the cities with a Draconic rune depicted in her map room (area C12), they gain advantage on the Charisma check made to influence Claugiyliamatar. If the characters cannot mention a rumor Claugiyliamatar believes or likes, she tells them to go away and return when they have some gossip for her.</p>
<p>Once the characters offer the dragon an appropriate rumor, she answers any questions they have honestly with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>She explains escalating undead attacks on her lair.</li>
<li>Claugiyliamatar cannot find the commander of the undead through her crystal balls. The green dragon believes the closest place to search for a necromancer is Leilon, so she had planned to threaten the people there for information (and make good on those threats if no information is offered).</li>
<li>After meeting the characters, she has decided to modify her plan&mldr;for now. The dragon knows from questioning previous undead invaders that they are loyal to an undead mage named Viantha Cruelhex. Claugiyliamatar is so far unable to use her crystal balls to spy on the undead, and all the servants she sent to capture Viantha have not returned. She asks the characters to capture or kill Viantha, returning with the prisoner or the deathlock&rsquo;s remains for questioning (see &ldquo;<strong>area Finding Viantha</strong>"). In exchange for Viantha, Claugiyliamatar agrees to leave Leilon alone.</li>

Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s Hoard</h4><p>The raised plateau that holds Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s treasure hoard is 20 feet high. The north and south edges of the plateau&rsquo;s edge each hold two statues (see &ldquo;Statues&rdquo; below). A character who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check notices three slight divots with a 5-foot diameter in the plateau floor between the two pairs of statues. A <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell reveals that these divots radiate auras of abjuration magic.</p>
<p>A permanent floor-to-ceiling <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of force</wc-fetch> created by Claugiyliamatar runs from the north wall to the south wall, between the statues and the treasure hoard. The area west of the <wc-fetch type=spell>wall of force</wc-fetch> is obscured by trapped green gas, but a character who makes a successful DC 17 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check notices a pile of treasure slightly silhouetted in the gas.</p>
<p>Characters can destroy the wall in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A character who casts the <wc-fetch type=spell>disintegrate</wc-fetch> spell destroys the wall.</li>
<li>If the statues of Dove Falconhand (in <strong>area area C8</strong>&rdquo; below) in the divots, the wall is destroyed. The wall reforms if any of the statues on the plateau are removed. If a statue other than those three is placed in a divot, the statue explodes with violent force. Each creature within 10 feet of the statue must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (<wc-roll>6d10</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the wall is destroyed, the gas behind it immediately expands, filling all of area C13 and C14. A creature that enters or starts its turn in the gas must make DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 77 (<wc-roll>22d6</wc-roll>) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures and objects in the gas are lightly obscured. The gas remains for 24 hours. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the gas after 4 hours. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 hour.</p>

Unfortunately, the ghost of Ebondeath&rsquo;s is nearby, waiting for this opportunity. Before she can say anything else, the dragon undergoes a terrible change, which is conveyed by reading the following boxed text aloud to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Claugiyliamatar falls to the floor, and her whole body begins to shake violently. Her tail thrashes, reducing stalagmites to dust and thunderously colliding with the cave&rsquo;s walls. The dragon foams at the mouth as a dark, swirling shadow flies into the cave and snakes up into her nostrils. Then, as suddenly as Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s violent fit started, it stops.</p>
<p>After a short pause, the dragon&rsquo;s eyes snap open, revealing her once-green irises to be black, lightless pits. &ldquo;I, Chardansearavitriol the Ebondeath, have returned! Praise be to Myrkul!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Chardansearavitriol possesses Claugiyliamatar&rsquo;s body, the dragon has some initial disorientation while getting used to the new form. Rather than fight in such a state, Chardansearavitriol flees the lair, returning to Ularan Mortus in the Mere of Dead Men.</p>
<p>As the dragon leaves, a sword wraith commander (see appendix A) plus one sword wraith warrior (see appendix A) per two members of the party (rounded down), not including sidekicks, invade the lair. The sword wraiths are loyal to Ularan Mortus and attack the characters, fighting to the death.</p>
