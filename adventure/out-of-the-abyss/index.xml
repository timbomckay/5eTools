The Underdark is filled with races and creatures too numerous to count or list, and foremost among these are the dark elves - the drow. Hated and feared even by their fellow dwellers in darkness, the drow raid other settlements in the Underdark as well as the surface world, taking prisoners back with them.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 2: Into Darkness</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-2/</guid><description>Once the adventurers escape from Velkynvelve, they&amp;rsquo;ll want to escape the Underdark. Already miles beneath the surface, they must make their way through an endless maze of passages and caverns, avoid pursuit by the drow, and find a route to the world above-all the while dealing with the dangers of the Underdark and struggling to find the resources they need to survive.
This chapter presents guidelines for the characters' travels between the various Underdark locales detailed in the other chapters of Out of the Abyss.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 3: The Darklake</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-3/</guid><description>Though its name might evoke images of a single subterranean body of water, the Darklake is a network of underground rivers, natural tunnels, and canals that connect innumerable water-filled caverns and chambers. This vast waterway stretches over a hundred miles across, with ceilings that are miles high in some places and depths that are unfathomable.
Long ago, duergar engineers extended and widened many of the interconnecting passages of the Darklake.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 4: Gracklstugh</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-4/</guid><description>Visitors to the duergar city of Gracklstugh are greeted by its hot and acrid air, followed by the angry red glare of the eternally burning smelters fueling the city&amp;rsquo;s metal works, its clanging heart, and the forges kept alive by the flames of Themberchaud, the red dragon that holds the title of Wyrmsmith. Gracklstugh toils endlessly, its smiths churning out the best armor and weapons among the Underdark races. Those who do business here refer to Gracklstugh as &amp;ldquo;the City of Blades.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 5: Neverlight Grove</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-5/</guid><description>Communities of myconids can be found throughout the Underdark. These intelligent, vaguely humanoid fungi lead lives of work and shared contemplation, providing shelter and safe passage to any who approach them peacefully.
The relative isolation of Neverlight Grove, its abundance of food and water, and the welcoming nature of its inhabitants might bring the characters here to rest, recuperate, and resupply. While in the grove, they can consult with the colony&amp;rsquo;s myconid sovereigns about possible ways back to the surface world, while enjoying a much-needed respite from the brutal and harrowing conditions of the Underdark.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 6: Blingdenstone</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-6/</guid><description>Blingdenstone, once called the City of Speaking Stones, is a deep gnome settlement founded more than two millennia ago. The deep gnomes, insular and secretive by nature, care little about histories and legacies, and thus most of the ruined city&amp;rsquo;s past is lost to time.
For centuries, Blingdenstone remained hidden and isolated from the rest of the Underdark, thanks to a combination of misdirection and magic. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until they provided shelter to a drow exile named Drizzt Do&amp;rsquo;Urden that the deep gnomes began to take a more active interest in the world outside their caverns.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 7: Escape From the Underdark</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-7/</guid><description>This chapter marks the midpoint of Out of the Abyss and sees the characters finally make their way out of the Underdark. Before their final push to freedom, however, the vengeful drow pursuing the adventurers catch up to them, intent on dragging them back to their domain of perpetual darkness.
If they survive this final confrontation, the characters reach the surface in a place of your choosing. After all their arduous adventures, they are finally safe to return to their homes, and must say goodbye to many of the NPCs who&amp;rsquo;ve been traveling with them.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 8: Audience in Gauntlgrym</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-8/</guid><description>After their escape from the Underdark in chapter 7, the adventurers have time to rest, recuperate, and reorient themselves back in the surface world from which they were taken. Some three months after their return, they receive a summons to the dwarf kingdom of Gauntlgrym in the North. King Bruenor Battlehammer desires an audience with them regarding their experiences in the Underdark. Representatives of several factions with an interest in what is happening in the Underdark will also be in attendance.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 9: Mantol-Derith</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-9/</guid><description>Mantol-Derith has endured for centuries as a neutral outpost where drow, duergar, svirfneblin, and surface dwellers can meet and trade without fearing for their lives. Despite its usefulness and the safety it enjoys, Mantol-Derith has never become a proper town. Those who maintain it as a trade hub have resisted any urge for expansion, apart from installing basic infrastructure to assist with commercial activities.
The Zhentarim took over the holdings where surface dwellers conducted business and quickly cornered the market for surface goods, gaining the organization a foothold in the Underdark.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 10: Descent Into the Depths</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-10/</guid><description>Having survived Mantol-Derith and obtained Ghazrim DuLoc&amp;rsquo;s ring, the adventurers and their allies continue on into the Underdark. This time, rather than escaped prisoners looking for a way out, they are at the head of an expeditionary force ready to challenge whatever the Underdark has to offer.
Much of this middle section of the adventure is freeform, dictated largely by the characters' decisions and tactics. The adventurers' immediate destination is the legendary library of Gravenhollow (see chapter 11), where they gain information that likely takes them to the tower of Araj, home of the mysterious drow archmage Vizeran DeVir.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 11: Gravenhollow</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-11/</guid><description>The library of Gravenhollow is a bastion of peace and order in an Underdark gone mad. Carved out long ago from the bones of the world and protected by ancient and potent magic, the library possesses a kind of awareness. It blocks and misdirects those unworthy of reaching its gates, even as it facilitates finding the way for those who need it.
The adventurers need to find the library in their quest to learn what has happened in the Underdark.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 12: The Tower of Vengeance</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-12/</guid><description>Offered an alliance by the drow archmage Vizeran DeVir, the adventurers travel to his tower in the depths of the Underdark. There, they learn more about what he knows of the threat posed by the demon lords-and potentially forge a pact with him to deal with that threat. They must be cautious, however, as their potential ally has his own interests at heart and his own agenda where his fellow drow are concerned.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 13: The Wormwrithings</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-13/</guid><description>Two of the components that Vizeran needs to craft the talisman for his ritual (see chapter 12) can be found relatively close to the archmage&amp;rsquo;s tower. The Wormwrithings are a honeycomb of tunnels spanning hundreds of miles in the northern reaches of the Underdark, carved from the rock by enormous purple worms. A purple worm nest in the Wormwrithings is an ideal place to find an unhatched purple worm egg.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 14: The Labyrinth</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-14/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-14/</guid><description>More of the components needed for Vizeran&amp;rsquo;s demon summoning ritual can be found in the depths of the Labyrinth-a snarl of twisting tunnels and caves extending approximately 240 miles from north to south and 120 miles east to west. Navigating the Labyrinth is a nightmare, since most tunnels follow a straight path only a short distance before doubling back on themselves or ending abruptly.
Baphomet the Horned King appeared in the Labyrinth when the demon lords were summoned to the Underdark.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 15: The City of Spiders</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-15/</guid><description>The center of the chaos and madness now spreading throughout the Underdark is the great drow city of Menzoberranzan. Few of the city&amp;rsquo;s drow residents know that the Demon Queen of Spiders is behind the summoning ritual that brought the demon lords to the Underdark-and that the reward for their faith in Lolth might well be their destruction.
Menzoberranzan was the site of Demogorgon&amp;rsquo;s appearance in the Underdark, and the lash of his tentacles and the crushing tread of his clawed feet left a trail of broken buildings, bodies, and minds.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 16: The Fetid Wedding</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-16/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-16/</guid><description>Zuggtmoy, Demon Queen of Fungi, plots to &amp;ldquo;wed&amp;rdquo; Araumycos, an enormous fungus occupying a large area of the Underdark. After uniting their powers in an unholy mockery of matrimony-in truth, a demonic rite of domination-Zuggtmoy will gain the power to transform the whole of the Underdark into her new Abyssal domain. The only things in her way are a core of resistance in the myconid community, the rage of her rival Juiblex, and the determination of the adventurers.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 17: Against the Demon Lords</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-17/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/chapter-17/</guid><description>In the culmination of Out of the Abyss, the heroes implement Vizeran DeVir&amp;rsquo;s scheme to take on the demon lords. The archmage&amp;rsquo;s ritual draws the demon lords together to fight to the death, leaving Demogorgon victorious but weakened as the adventurers face off against the Prince of Demons. Even wounded and weakened, though, Demogorgon is a legendary foe, and the fate of the Underdark and all Faerûn rests on the adventurers' final battle.</description></item><item><title>Appendix A: Modifying Backgrounds</title><link>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/appendix-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adventure/out-of-the-abyss/appendix-a/</guid><description>This appendix provides alternative background features and bonds for player characters, with options that are strongly connected to the NPCs, themes, and events of this adventure.
