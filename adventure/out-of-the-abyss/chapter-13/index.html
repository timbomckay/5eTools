<p>Two of the components that Vizeran needs to craft the talisman for his ritual (see chapter 12) can be found relatively close to the archmage&rsquo;s tower. The Wormwrithings are a honeycomb of tunnels spanning hundreds of miles in the northern reaches of the Underdark, carved from the rock by enormous purple worms. A purple worm nest in the Wormwrithings is an ideal place to find an unhatched purple worm egg. Additionally, Vizeran has heard rumors of a beholder living in the Vast Oblivium, a chasm deep within the Wormwrithings. If the characters didn&rsquo;t obtain the central eye from Lorthuun or Xazax (the beholders in chapter 9), they can search the Vast Oblivium for the beholder believed to lair there.</p>

The Vast Oblivium lies some twelve miles south of this nursery. Use the guidelines in chapters 2 and 10 as the party travels through the Underdark, but use the Wormwrithings Encounters table instead of the random encounter tables in chapter 2. Foraging is more difficult in the Wormwrithings, requiring successful DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) checks.</p>
<p>Faerzress permeates only the fringes of the Wormwrithings. While the party explores this region of the Underdark, spellcasters won&rsquo;t have to deal with the effects described under &ldquo;Faerzress&rdquo; in chapter 2.</p>
<p>The tunnels created by the purple worms are tubular and roughly 10 feet in diameter. A typical stretch of tunnel is 1d6 miles long before it intersects with another tunnel or a naturally formed cavern.</p>

Roll a d20 and consult the Wormwrithings Encounters table to determine what, if anything, the characters and their expeditionary force encounter.</p>
<p>When an encounter occurs, roll a d6 to determine how the area is illuminated. A roll of 1 indicates the area is dimly lit by phosphorescent lichen, while a 2-6 indicates the area is dark. The twisting tunnels of the Wormwrithings give creatures the opportunity to surprise the characters (see &ldquo;Noticing Threats&rdquo; in chapter 2).</p>

Otherwise, they are refugees who became lost in the Underdark after orcs attacked their stronghold and chased them underground. These dwarves are searching for a route to the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Treasure.</strong> Each dwarf carries 1d10 pounds of food, 1d4 gallons of water (stored in canteens), and 1d6 gems worth 10 gp each.</p>

A grick alpha and 2d4 gricks are using the cyst as a nest, attacking anything that passes by.</p>
<p><strong>Treasure.</strong> The walls of the cyst have precious crystals growing out of them. Characters can harvest these crystals, collecting 3d6 intact crystals worth 50 gp each.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A foul stench and a cacophony of faint, hissing voices rises from ahead. The tunnel plunges sharply downward into a vast, open cavern dimly lit by luminous fungi and bisected by an underground stream. Tall reptilian humanoids stand on either side of the stream, waving makeshift weapons and howling threats at each other in a hissing language.</p>
<p>The group of creatures closest to you has a captive lashed between two stalagmites atop a low rise in the cavern floor. That floor is some twenty feet below you, down a steep but navigable tunnel whose walls are piled high with rubble. The creatures are preoccupied with their conflict and haven&rsquo;t noticed you yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reptilian humanoids are troglodytes that worship a lesser god called Laogzed-a reptilian horror that dwells in the Abyss. Although Laogzed isn&rsquo;t a demon lord (and so has not been summoned to the Underdark), troglodytes are being drawn across the Underdark to sites where the demon lords have manifested.</p>
<p>Any character who understands the troglodytes quickly learns what drives the conflict. Otherwise, a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check can provide a general sense of what&rsquo;s going on. The troglodytes ambushed and killed a drow scouting party whose leader wielded a magic sword that S&rsquo;slaar, the troglodyte chieftain, claimed as a trophy. However, S&rsquo;slaar&rsquo;s war marshal, H&rsquo;slaat, was the one who killed the drow leader, and who now claims the right to wield the blade.</p>
<p>The disagreement blossomed into a full-fledged conflict, and the other troglodytes quickly chose sides. On one side of the stream, troglodytes loyal to H&rsquo;slaat seized S&rsquo;slaar&rsquo;s mate and are threatening her, hoping to force the chieftain to back down. On his side of the stream, S&rsquo;slaar is wildly swinging the magic sword and screaming, as the troglodytes loyal to him shout insults and taunts at the other side.</p>
<p>The characters can turn back without being spotted and find an alternate route bypassing the troglodytes, but doing so adds forty-eight miles (and an increased chance of random encounters) to the distance they must travel before they reach the purple worm nursery. If the characters simply watch the standoff unfold, see &ldquo;Resolving the Standoff&rdquo; later in this section.</p>

<p><strong>Light.</strong> Nightlights (see &ldquo;<strong>area Fungi of the Underdark</strong>&rdquo; in chapter 2) and other luminous fungi dimly illuminate the caves and tunnels throughout the troglodyte lair.</p>
<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The main cavern has a 90-foot-high ceiling. Smaller side caverns have 60-foot-high ceilings. Unless noted otherwise, all ceilings have stalactites hanging from them.</p>
<p><strong>Stench.</strong> The troglodytes' foul musk can be smelled throughout the lair, although the stench is not strong enough to have any detrimental effect on visitors.</p>

Entrance Tunnel</h3><p>The worm tunnel the adventurers are traveling through opens up atop a steep slope leading 15 feet down into the open cavern. The slope is difficult terrain. As long as the adventurers aren&rsquo;t calling attention to themselves, they can remain undetected here indefinitely. The troglodytes are too distracted by their standoff to notice them.</p>
<p>Rubble is piled up along the walls on either side of the tunnel. The rubble on the east side of the tunnel conceals a hidden passageway. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher notices the hidden passage. Anyone actively searching the rubble finds it with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Adventurers who head into the passage beyond the rubble discover the hidden entryway to <strong>area 5</strong> at the end of the tunnel.</p>

Cave Floor</h3><p>H&rsquo;slaat, a troglodyte champion of Laogzed, and twenty-two troglodyte are arrayed in a rough battle line along the south bank of a freshwater stream that nearly bisects the cavern. The stream runs west to east, tumbling down a short waterfall and forming a small pool (<strong>area 9</strong>). The stream is about 15 feet wide and 3 feet deep at its deepest point. It can be crossed on foot but is difficult terrain.</p>
<p>The troglodytes are so distracted that it&rsquo;s possible to sneak through this area undetected as long as the adventurers stay close to the cavern walls. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check or be noticed by the troglodytes.</p>

Rise</h3><p>This upthrust section of the cavern floor is edged by a steep slope to the southwest and a 6-foot-high cliff elsewhere. The cliff requires a successful DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.</p>
<p>Five troglodyte loyal to H&rsquo;slaat are stationed here. In addition to their regular attacks, they are armed with javelins that they throw from a pile of twenty-five javelins on the cavern floor near them.</p>
<p><strong>Javelin.</strong> <em>Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) piercing damage</em>.</p>
<p>H&rsquo;hoort, a troglodyte and Chieftain S&rsquo;slaar&rsquo;s mate, is lashed between two stalagmites here. Another troglodyte stands guard next to her. Releasing H&rsquo;hoort won&rsquo;t earn the adventurers a respite from the opportunistic troglodytes, but if the characters hold her captive, both sides are reluctant to attack them.</p>

<p>The troglodyte chieftain has arrayed his forces along the narrow strip of high ground between the basin and the stream. Chieftain S&rsquo;slaar is a troglodyte with 20 hit points and a +2 longsword. While he wields the sword, S&rsquo;slaar gains the following action option:</p>
<p><strong>+2 Longsword.</strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10+4) slashing damage if used with two hands</em>.</p>

Supplies and Captives</h3><p>This area is held by H&rsquo;slaat&rsquo;s forces. One troglodyte guards the cave. A character can sneak past the guard with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>
<p>The cave floor is strewn with gnawed bones-the remains of dead dwarves and drow. A circular pit, nine feet deep, holds six captives - two drow and four shield dwarf commoner. These unfortunates were separated from larger groups (see &ldquo;Random Encounters&rdquo; earlier in this chapter) and captured by the troglodytes. Every couple of days, one of them is eaten by the tribe. The captives are filthy and weak; each has four levels of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> and 1 hit point remaining. Any of the captives can explain the nature of the conflict between H&rsquo;slaat and S&rsquo;slaar. If freed, the drow immediately flee into the Underdark, but the dwarves offer to join the expeditionary force if the adventurers liberate them. The drow are male members of House Melarn and are named Rinil and Xol. The shield dwarves hail from the Silver Marches and are named Dauthorn Brightmantle (male), Traldak Xornbane (male), Zulia Stonewhisper (female), and Hargritt Hammerhome (female).</p>
<p>Rubble is piled up along the south wall of the cavern, concealing a hidden passageway to <strong>area 1</strong>. Anyone with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher notices the passage. Anyone actively searching the rubble must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to find it.</p>

Steam Vent</h3><p>A thick jet of hot steam spews forth from a crack in the floor near the east wall of this cavern. Growing around the steam vent is a patch of fire lichen (see &ldquo;<strong>area Fungi of the Underdark</strong>&rdquo; in chapter 2).</p>
<p>Anyone with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher notices a vein of precious gems embedded in the rock wall behind the steam vent. Anyone actively searching the cavern spots the gem deposit automatically. The gems can&rsquo;t be reached without entering a 10-foot-by-10-foot-by-10-foot cloud of hot steam. Any creature that enters the area or starts its turn there takes 1d8 fire damage. The litters in <strong>area 5</strong> or a similar object can be used to block the steam emerging from the vent for 1 round before weakening and falling apart.</p>

Unless the characters intervene, the conflict plays out as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>H&rsquo;slaat orders his fellow troglodytes in <strong>area 2</strong> to rush across the stream while the troglodytes in <strong>area 3</strong> rain javelins down on the chieftain&rsquo;s forces. Meanwhile, H&rsquo;Slaat grabs H&rsquo;hoort from <strong>area 3</strong>.</li>
<li>H&rsquo;slaat crosses the stream, dragging her behind him. He threatens to kill her unless the chieftain meets him in battle.</li>
<li>The troglodytes in areas 5 and 7 try to make their way through the side caverns to attack the chieftain&rsquo;s forces in <strong>area 4</strong> from the rear. However, if the ropers and piercers in <strong>area 8</strong> have not already been killed by the adventurers, the troglodytes are surprised and massacred.</li>
<li>S&rsquo;slaar&rsquo;s cavalry in <strong>area 14</strong> makes its way through the western side caves and attack H&rsquo;slaat&rsquo;s forces from behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the adventurers don&rsquo;t intervene in any way, the battle lasts approximately 20 rounds and ends when H&rsquo;slaat kills the chieftain in the basin at <strong>area 4</strong>. Half the troglodytes on both sides are killed in the conflict. Those who remain accept H&rsquo;slaat as their new chieftain.</p>
<p>While the battle is underway, a character can sneak through an area occupied by troglodytes with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>

However, within six miles of the nursery they come across an unexpected presence in the darkness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remnants of a rockfall have opened up a small vaulted cavern along the passageway. Apart from the occasional glowing insect scuttling along the walls, the cavern is dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud voice booms out all around you in Undercommon: &ldquo;Turn back or suffer a death so horrible you cannot imagine! You have been warned!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The voice is actually a minor illusion cantrip. If no one in the party understands Undercommon, the dire warning is just loud gibberish to them. The cantrip was cast by Hanne Hallen, a young drow allied with House Mizzrym. Hanne has the statistics of a drow, with the following modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hanne&rsquo;s AC is 12, or 15 with mage armor. She doesn&rsquo;t wear a chain shirt.</li>
<li>Her Intelligence is 17 (+3).</li>
<li>Add Arcana +5 and Investigation +5 to her skills.</li>
<li>Add Common to her list of known languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hanne also has the following Spellcasting feature:</p>
<p>Spellcasting. Hanne is a 1st-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following wizard spells prepared:</p>
<p><em>Cantrips (at will):</em> minor illusion, ray of frost</p>
<p><em>1st Level (2 slots):</em> shield, mage armor</p>
<p>Hanne&rsquo;s mother, Zhora Hallen, leads the Dark Hunters-drow explorers who steal purple worm eggs. These eggs are prized by wizards, who use them in various arcane rituals. Hanne was on her first egg run with her mother&rsquo;s team when a passing purple worm burst into the tunnel they were traveling through, separating her from the rest of the group. Convinced that her mother and the rest of the Dark Hunters were killed by the purple worm, the headstrong and halfstarved young mage-in-training is attempting to make her way back to Menzoberranzan.</p>
<p>Hanne spotted the adventurers as they approached and tried to scare them away. She&rsquo;s hiding in the rubble along the cavern wall but can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p>If the adventurers decide to turn back, finding another tunnel going in the right direction adds twenty miles to their journey to the worm nursery. If they press ahead, the voice shouts in Undercommon again: &ldquo;Fools! Flee now! This is your final warning!&rdquo; Once the adventurers enter the cavern, Hanne can be spotted with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. If spotted, Hanne threatens the party with her &ldquo;powerful magic,&rdquo; but drops her hostile attitude if offered food and water. She can be convinced to tell her story with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>
<p>If the characters attack Hanne, she fights to the best of her ability. If the adventurers are friendly toward her, Hanne is willing to travel with them for safety.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you make your way through a long tunnel, everything around you begins to shake and rumble. Suddenly, the tunnel floor gives way at your feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tunnel through which the characters travel is directly above <strong>area 1</strong> of the nursery. The burrowing of a nearby purple worm weakens the tunnel floor, causing a 10-foot section of it to break apart and collapse. Any character in the area must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 25 feet into <strong>area 1</strong> below.</p>

<p><strong>Light.</strong> All tunnels and chambers are dark unless the text states otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Purple Worm Tunnels.</strong> The tunnels marked T1, T2, and T3 on the map do not exist when the characters first enter the nursery. They are created by purple worms after the party arrives, as noted here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fifteen minutes after the party enters <strong>area 1</strong>, a purple worm digs into <strong>area 1</strong>, then travels through <strong>area 3</strong> and creates tunnel T1 to enter <strong>area 8</strong>.</li>
<li>Ten minutes after the first worm arrives, a second purple worm enters through the tunnel in <strong>area 7</strong>. It makes its way through the adjoining echo chamber, then into <strong>area 8</strong>. Then it digs tunnel T2 into the eastern echo chamber before exiting through the worm tunnel in <strong>area 14</strong>.</li>
<li>Fifteen minutes after the second worm arrives, another purple worm enters through the tunnel in <strong>area 7</strong>, digs tunnel T3 from the southern echo chamber into the eastern echo chamber, then exits through the worm tunnel in <strong>area 13</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visiting worms are heralded by a low rumbling sound 2 minutes before they appear. (The bats in <strong>area 9</strong> also swarm and flee their roost 1 minute before a purple worm appears.) Purple worms ignore intruders except those in areas 5 or 8, but they won&rsquo;t pursue anyone fleeing from those areas.</p>

Fungus Cave</h3><p>A variety of fungi blankets this dark, 15-foot-high cavern. Every 10 minutes spent foraging here yields 1d3 pounds of edible fungi per forager (to a maximum of 30 pounds).</p>
<p>The passage to <strong>area 3</strong> is a steep slope leading 10 feet upward, and covered in small rocks and gravel. Moving up the slope requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed check, a character slips and tumbles down to the bottom of the slope, taking no damage. If someone at the top of the slope lowers a rope to help other characters climb, no check is necessary.</p>

Ossuary</h3><p>This 30-foot-high chamber is dimly lit by luminescent lichen. Thousands of bones carpet the cavern floor, including many recognizable as humanoid (primarily dwarf, elf, and goblin) and some belonging to strange and unidentifiable creatures. Exactly where the bones came from is a mystery. A crack in the south wall leads to <strong>area 4</strong>.</p>
<p>The tunnel marked T1 on the map doesn&rsquo;t exist until a purple worm creates it fifteen minutes after the party discovers <strong>area 1</strong> (see the &ldquo;Worm Nursery: General Features&rdquo; sidebar).

Echo Chambers</h3><p>These three 60-foot-high caverns, hollowed out and expanded by purple worms, are set around <strong>area 8</strong> as a defensive measure. Using their saliva, the worms have created thick, resinous strands that stretch from wall to wall. These strands are 2 feet thick and suspended some 50 feet above the floor.</p>
<p>Any noise in one of these chambers (including a normal speaking voice or metal striking metal) causes the strands to reverberate, creating a loud humming that echoes throughout the surrounding caverns, alerting the purple worms to the presence of trespassers.</p>

Caretaker&rsquo;s Quarters</h3><p>Phosphorescent lichen clings to the walls of this 30-foothigh cavern. Stronk, a brutish fomorian, lairs here. Somehow the giant formed a bond with the purple worms, becoming a caretaker of their eggs. He regularly checks the eggs, brushes fungus off them, and defends them against predators.</p>
<p>Stronk is sleeping on a pile of skins and loudly snoring when the adventurers arrive. Characters looking around the room can see the remnants of the fomorian&rsquo;s grim meals-travelers lost in the Wormwrithings or egg-hunting adventurers.</p>
<p>Venturing into Stronk&rsquo;s lair without waking him requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If awakened, the fomorian shouts out about &ldquo;killing egg thieves&rdquo; and &ldquo;protecting my precious ones,&rdquo; then fights to defend the nesting area and protect the eggs. If Stronk is reduced to half his hit points or fewer, he charges into the adjoining echo chamber (<strong>area 5</strong>) and bellows to summon a purple worm before rejoining the battle.</p>

Egg Chamber</h3><p>The ceiling of this cavern is 80 feet high. A pair of purple worms have laid their eggs here, cementing them together and anchoring them to the cavern walls with their resinous saliva. Seven clusters hold six eggs each, as noted on the map. Each egg is a silvery sphere 3 feet in diameter. Its shell is tough (AC 20), but an egg is destroyed if it takes any amount of damage.</p>
<p>three of the four resin strands anchoring the network of egg clusters to the cavern walls feature stray threads that drop all the way down to the cave floor. It&rsquo;s possible to climb up to the strands at these points to reach the eggs. Traversing the strands is slow going; each 1 foot of distance costs 3 feet of movement. Anyone fighting or taking strenuous action atop a strand must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid falling off. An adventurer who reaches an egg cluster and has a suitable cutting tool (such as a dagger, sword, or axe) can carefully hack an egg out in 2d4 minutes.</p>
<p>The upper reaches of the egg chamber are covered in webs spun by the giant spiders in <strong>area 11</strong>. Some of these webs reach all the way down to the egg clusters.</p>
<p>For every five minutes the adventurers spend in this room, check for a random encounter by rolling a d20 and consulting the Egg Chamber Encounters table.</p>

<p>The giant spider walks on the ceiling and surprises the adventurers unless someone in the party has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher.</p>
<p>If a purple worm appears, it enters the nursery through the tunnel in <strong>area 7</strong> and circles the outside of the cavern. Any party member in the egg chamber can try to hide with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check. A failed check means the party member attracts the worm&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>The purple worm attacks anyone it detects in the chamber except the giant spiders from <strong>area 11</strong> and the fomorian from <strong>area 6</strong>. It won&rsquo;t pursue fleeing characters anywhere except into the adjoining echo chambers (<strong>area 5</strong>) or the slop cave (<strong>area 10</strong>). If it doesn&rsquo;t detect any intruders, the purple worm exits the complex through the tunnel in <strong>area 7</strong>, passing through the nearest echo chamber along the way.</p>

Bat Cave</h3><p>This cave is thick with stalactites and stalagmites, and home to thousands of bats. The cavern floor is covered in a thick layer of guano, making the floor difficult terrain. The bats spend most of their time clinging to the cavern&rsquo;s 60-foot-high ceiling, but the noise of the purple worms drives them into a shrieking, flapping frenzy.</p>
<p>Whenever a purple worm enters the <strong>area 8</strong> (whether as a random encounter or in response to an alarm from <strong>area 5</strong>, or as noted in &ldquo;Worm Nursery: General Features&rdquo;), a swarm of bats flies out of the cave 1 minute before the worm appears. Roll a d6 to determine which way the bats go. On a roll of 1-3, the bats take the shortest route to the tunnel in <strong>area 7</strong> and exit through that tunnel. On a roll of 4-6, the bats take the shortest route to the tunnel in <strong>area 14</strong> and exit through that tunnel.</p>
<p>The swarm doesn&rsquo;t attack unless threatened, but any creature that occupies an area the swarm passes through is buffeted by scores of bats, taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage.</p>

The multitude of predators that seek out the worms' eggs provide the spiders with easy prey, while the presence of the spiders provides additional protection for the hatchery.</p>
<p>The eastern half of this cavern floor is covered in webs stretching up to the ceiling. See &ldquo;Dungeon Hazards&rdquo; in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide for rules about webs. Eight giant spider lurk in the nest, minus any killed elsewhere in the nursery.</p>

Zhora and her comrades survived the purple worm attack that separated them from Hanne (see &ldquo;Voice in the Dark&rdquo;). Zhora believes that Hanne is dead.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes after the characters first enter the purple worm nursery through <strong>area 1</strong>, Zhora and her Dark Hunters enter these caverns through the tunnel in <strong>area 7</strong>, then scale down to the cavern floor. They spend a few minutes regrouping and making their way through the southern echo chamber, then arrive in <strong>area 8</strong> and scale the resin strands to grab two purple worm eggs. If they encounter the adventurers and Hanne isn&rsquo;t present, the drow are hostile, though they might be convinced to enter a temporary truce with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>
<p>If Hanne is with the party and has been well treated, she and her mother have a quiet reunion. Zhora gravely promises the adventurers that she will repay the debt she owes them however she can.</p>

<p><strong>Light.</strong> The tunnels and chambers of the Vast Oblivium are dimly lit by glowing fungi and lichen.</p>
<p><strong>Bridges.</strong> The central chasm of Karazikar&rsquo;s Maw is 100 feet across, spanned by bridges made of gut and zurkhwood that are anchored to metal rings in the rock walls of the tunnel entrances. The tunnels are staggered so that the bridges cross over each other at different points. From any bridge, a character can climb or drop 10 feet to reach a bridge leading to a tunnel on an adjacent level.</p>
<p><strong>Chasm.</strong> The chasm of Karazikar&rsquo;s Maw extends some five hundred feet below the lowest bridged tunnels, plunging into darkness. A fall into the chasm deals 20d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong>Shafts.</strong> The ten vertical shafts around the perimeter of the chasm are each 30 feet wide and 100 feet from top to bottom. They&rsquo;re located 100 feet from the edge of the chasm and connected to it by tunnels. Each shaft features side chambers and small caverns, and has rope ladders for Karazikar&rsquo;s slaves to move up and down them.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Like most of its kind, this beholder is hateful and paranoid, trusting no one. Its servants are keenly aware that failure to please their master means death or petrification.</p>
<p>Karazikar has goals beyond simply ruling over its domain. Long ago, the beholder heard rumors of an arcane device known as the Maze Engine, capable of shifting the gears of reality. During the last Great Modron March, Karazikar captured a pentadrone and afterward became convinced the Maze Engine existed in the Underdark. Unfortunately, the modron&rsquo;s axiomatic mind couldn&rsquo;t be broken, and it perished rather than reveal anything. Since then, the beholder has made it known that it&rsquo;s interested in certain &ldquo;curiosities,&rdquo; and it rewards anyone who brings it more modrons or hints about the existence or location of the Maze Engine (which is described in chapter 14).</p>

As Karazikar&rsquo;s &ldquo;high priest,&rdquo; he leads other slaves in worship of their master and carries out the beholder&rsquo;s commands.</p>
<p>Formerly an adventurer from the surface world, Shedrak and his companions delved too deeply into the Wormwrithings. His companions became Karazikar&rsquo;s playthings for a time, but Shedrak alone was able to resist and withstand all ten of the beholder&rsquo;s eye rays. Impressed by this feat of extraordinary luck, Karazikar made the human his acolyte after breaking his mind and his will. Shedrak is completely mad, considers Karazikar a god, and brooks no defiance or disrespect toward his &ldquo;divine master.&rdquo;</p>

Some were captured while wandering too far from their Underdark settlements, while others were purchased in the slave bazaars of Menzoberranzan. The youngest slaves were born in the Vast Oblivium and raised here, knowing no other life. Many of the beholder&rsquo;s slaves worship it, particularly those born here, their minds warped by the aberration&rsquo;s charm rays and their lifelong captivity.</p>
<p>All of the slaves fear Karazikar, and the notion of acting against the beholder seems impossible to them. However, witnessing the bravery of the adventurers has a chance to sway them. If the characters demonstrate their willingness to challenge the beholder (including by killing Shedrak), surviving slaves can be convinced to aid them with a successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a failed check, slaves either attack the characters or hide from them, waiting for Karazikar to deal with them.</p>

<p>The characters' tunnel ends at the top of one of the exterior shafts of the Vast Oblivium (see &ldquo;The Vast Oblivium: General Features&rdquo;). Characters can use the rope ladders to reach the bottom of the shaft, and from there make their way to the chasm known as Karazikar&rsquo;s Maw.</p>

Use the mage statistics to represent Shedrak, with the following modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shedrak is chaotic evil.</li>
<li>He has ten small eyes tattooed on his bald head that allow him to see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.</li>
<li>He carries a nonmagical staff topped with a varnished beholder eye. Karazikar can see through this eye and treats it as one of its own eyes for the purpose of using its eye rays. Breaking the staff renders the eye inert and prevents Karazikar from using this property.</li>
<li>He carries a potion of healing, a potion of poison, and a spell scroll of globe of invulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the adventurers are respectful toward Shedrak and his master - and particularly if they claim to carry messages or items of possible interest to the beholder - Shedrak agrees to lead them to Karazikar.</p>
<p>If the characters become hostile, Shedrak orders them to depart, lest they provoke the wrath of his all-powerful master. If attacked, he uses his <wc-fetch type=spell>globe of invulnerability</wc-fetch> scroll, casts <wc-fetch type=spell>fly</wc-fetch> on himself, and flies into the chasm.</p>
<p>Shedrak allows up to ten party members accompany him, demanding that the rest of the expeditionary force remain behind. Shedrak then leads the smaller group across a bridge into the middle of Karazikar&rsquo;s Maw.</p>
<h4 id=audience-with-karazikar>

The beholder descends from the shadowy ceiling, staying at least 20 feet away from the bridge.</p>
<p>If the characters have come to talk, Karazikar hears them out. The beholder is supremely arrogant, and it speaks and understands only Deep Speech and Undercommon. If any of the characters bluff about having information of interest to the beholder, Karazikar mentions the Maze Engine, either to see if the adventurers know of it, or in a scoffing tone to suggest they can&rsquo;t possibly know anything that it has not already learned.</p>
<p>Killing Karazikar is the only way to claim the beholder&rsquo;s central eye for Vizeran. At the first hint of violence, the beholder uses its disintegration ray to disintegrate a 10-foot section of the bridge, hoping to plunge one of more party members into the chasm. It then targets enemies with its other eye rays and makes full use of its lair actions (see the Monster Manual). Against characters who attempt to hide from it, the beholder uses a lair action to cause an eye to open up on a wall with line of effect to a hiding creature, then attacks with one of its eye rays.</p>
<p>Karazikar&rsquo;s slaves fearfully scatter during any confrontation, but if Shedrak is alive, he protects his &ldquo;god&rdquo; as best he can. If the beholder is reduced to 45 or fewer hit points, it attempts to flee, ordering Shedrak (if he&rsquo;s still alive) to cover its retreat.</p>
<p>When the beholder is reduced to 0 hit points, its corpse slowly sinks, falling 10 feet at the start of every turn until it reaches the bottom of the chasm. A character within reach of the beholder can use an action to gouge out its central eye. There is also a 10 percent chance at the end of each turn that the beholder&rsquo;s corpse lands on a bridge.</p>

Each slave bears the brand of Karazikar on its forehead-a scar shaped like an open eye. The slaves are unarmed and include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>21 shield dwarf commoner</li>
<li>17 human commoner</li>
<li>11 moon elf commoner</li>
<li>8 female drow and 1 male drow</li>
<li>5 deep <strong>gnomes</strong></li>
<li>23 goblin</li>
<li>15 orog</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the slaves have four levels of <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> (see appendix A of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook) and can&rsquo;t do much more than eat and follow simple instructions. They join the party&rsquo;s expeditionary force if urged or ordered to do so, but they aren&rsquo;t effective combatants until they&rsquo;ve rested and reduced their <wc-fetch type=condition>exhaustion</wc-fetch> level.</p>
<p>The slaves know several intriguing bits of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Karazikar hid its treasure in the uppermost reaches of the chasm. The only way to reach the treasury is by levitation or flight.</li>
<li>The beholder was preoccupied with finding an arcane contraption called the Maze Engine.</li>
<li>The beholder recently captured a strange mechanical creature that might know where the Maze Engine is located (see &ldquo;Modron Prisoner&rdquo; below). The creature is locked in a room sealed with a rolling stone door. The beholder used its telekinesis eye ray to open and close the door.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any slaves that don&rsquo;t join the party are anxious to make their way to the nearest peaceful Underdark settlement. The drow are eager to return to Menzoberranzan, the deep gnomes to Blingdenstone. If the characters urge the slaves to leave the Vast Oblivium and make their own way home, they are all killed while trying to escape from the Wormwrithings. If the characters assign members of their expeditionary force to lead the slaves out of the Wormwrithings, the slaves stand a much better chance of making it to safety.</p>

The room is sealed off with a 6-inch-thick circular stone door that can be rolled aside with a DC 20 Strength check or opened with a knock spell or similar magic. The room holds a damaged duodrone that Karazikar recently captured in the hopes of unlocking more information about the Maze Engine.</p>
<p>The duodrone has 1 hit point remaining and speaks its own language of clicks and whirs, always referring to itself as &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us.&rdquo; The demonic madness as scrambled its memory, but if a greater restoration spell is cast on it, the modron remembers two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;We were part of a great march. We were separated. Then we were lost. Then we were captured. Then we started freaking out. Then you found us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We know nothing about a &lsquo;Maze Engine.&rsquo; However, we can detect an Orderer approximately 289 miles south of our present location.&rdquo; (The &ldquo;Orderer,&rdquo; claims the modron, is a device that brings order to chaos. It is, in fact, what others refer to as the Maze Engine.)</li>
