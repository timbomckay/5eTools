<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p><em>Infernal Machine Rebuild</em> hopefully provides plenty of options for you to run the adventure the way that works best for your campaign. But if you&rsquo;d like to customize this adventure even further, consider any of the following possibilities.</p>

<h3 id=clandestine-hags>
<a href=#clandestine-hags class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Clandestine Hags</h3><p>If having three dryads working together is too immediate a tipoff that these might be hags forming a coven, you can add a fourth illusory mother to the mix to help allay suspicion. Created from a few logs and branches, Mother Hedgehog sits quietly in the corner of the cottage. If the characters attempt to speak with her, the programmed illusion is able to mumble a few incoherent words. A successful DC 16 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Investigation</wc-fetch>) check detects this illusion.</p>
<p>The hags' cottage is built from three trees entwined together. These trees might contain the three true dryads whose appearances the hags have stolen for their own use, and who have been enslaved by the hags to help with their corrupt gardening. If the characters treat with Banrion, the unicorn asks them to help free the dryads to set the woods back to order.</p>
<p>Instead of the hags being disguised as goodly dryads, you might instead choose to reverse the scenario. The Three Mothers might really be dryads in need of help, with Banrion the unicorn an evil creature that must be defeated to save the woods. The unicorn might even be using its dark magic to cause the dryads to appear as hags.</p>
<h3 id=unicorn-showdown>
<a href=#unicorn-showdown class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Unicorn Showdown</h3><p>If the characters initially make an aggressive approach toward Banrion (whether because the hags have fooled them or because the unicorn is evil), you can make the fight tougher by having the unicorn appear while the characters are attempting to cross the clock tower bridge. While fighting on the bridge, Banrion looks to knock characters off the tower into the chasm below, or even to try to collapse the tower under the characters while she teleports away.</p>
<p>If the unicorn later makes peace with the characters, she teleports down into the chasm (if still able to) and heals them.</p>
<h2 id=chapter-2-an-invitation-extended>

<h3 id=updated-guides>
<a href=#updated-guides class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Updated Guides</h3><p>As written, the mechanical guides can safely teleport the characters to and from the specific adventure locations. If it fits with your campaign, you might opt to allow teleportation to other locations in time and space with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check. A failed check causes the characters to be misdirected physically or temporally, as you determine. If the characters claim any missing components of the <em>Infernal Machine</em>, those components can be added to the mechanical guide, providing a +2 bonus to this check per component.</p>
<p>You might decide that neither agent would ever allow the components they already possess to leave their sight, or that the characters are the first ones to have come across any missing components. If so, Lynx&rsquo;s guide is powered by a dangerous combination of living <wc-fetch type=spell>teleport</wc-fetch> and <wc-fetch type=spell>time stop</wc-fetch> spells, and might malfunction as you see fit. Sir Ursas&rsquo;s guide is a captured quarut (an inevitable that seeks to uphold the laws of space and time), and which is forced to use its powers as Ursas demands. Though the quarut is programmed to prevent it from revealing its plight outright, it might provide clues during the adventure that all is not as it seems.</p>
<h3 id=healthy-competition>
<a href=#healthy-competition class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Healthy Competition</h3><p>When the characters make their choice of which agent they want to work with, whatever agent they turn down immediately arranges to send out their own competing expedition. (If the characters agree to work for both agents, both agents might still send out second redundant expeditions as insurance.)</p>
<p>These expeditions are composed of five cultist servants, led either by the enhanced medusa for Lynx, or the brains in iron for Sir Ursas (see below for more information on both). Each expedition also has its own mechanical guide. You might use the members of the rival expedition to chase after the characters, or they might have already arrived at one of the locations and be set up for the characters to stumble upon. The members of the alternative expedition might set obstacles along the way, possibly inspiring the characters to do the same. Using the power of a mechanical guide might allow for the creation of particularly devious traps that can be set across space and time. And the members of the alternative expedition certainly look to sabotage or destroy the characters' mechanical guide in order to strand them.</p>
<p>These competitors might succeed in securing some of the missing components, whether they steal them out from under the characters or take them directly in combat. Any stolen components will be delivered to their respective agents before the characters return from the past.</p>
<h3 id=enhanced-medusa>
<a href=#enhanced-medusa class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Enhanced Medusa</h3><p>Like the enhanced sphinx from Lost Laboratory of Kwalish, this creature has been augmented with various technologies from the Barrier Peaks. Specifically, its eyes have been replaced with mechanical frames into which it slots different lenses. This is the same magical technology that was used to create another artifact, <em>Daoud&rsquo;s Wondrous Lanthorn</em>. The medusa is nicknamed &ldquo;Daoud&rsquo;s Living Lanthorn&rdquo; as a result.</p>
<p>The enhanced medusa uses the medusa stat block with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has <wc-fetch type=sense>truesight</wc-fetch> out to a range of 60 feet.</li>
<li>It can cast the <wc-fetch type=spell>light</wc-fetch> cantrip at will.</li>
<li>Its Petrifying Gaze trait turns creatures into metal, wood, or porcelain (the medusa&rsquo;s choice) rather than stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this adventure is played as a sequel to Lost Laboratory of Kwalish, the enhanced medusa might seek revenge for what befell its ancestor Gloine Nathair-Nathair, or could be appeased with information regarding that medusa&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>

Light cast through the different faces of the lanthorn created different magical effects, which the lanthorn fueled with crushed gemstones.</p>

The brains share insights and knowledge with one another, and have typically been taken from creatures that desired to prolong their consciousnessâ€”or that were tasked with controlling a construct for all time as punishment.</p>
<p>A brain in iron uses the brain in a jar stat block with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is lawful neutral.</li>
<li>It has the construct type.</li>
<li>Its size is Large.</li>
<li>It has Armor Class 15 (natural armor).</li>
<li>It has a speed of 20 feet.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this adventure is played as a sequel to Lost Laboratory of Kwalish, this creature began as the brains in jars encountered in the Barrier Peaks. After constructing a new collective body from spare parts, the brains escaped (and now seek revenge against the characters if they did not aid the brains sufficiently during that adventure). The brains' collective goal in seeking the missing components is to be able to transfer themselves into the ultimate mechanical bodyâ€”the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em>.</p>

Any character who discusses traps with Moghadam can impart to him a new deadly designâ€”either using suitable roleplaying and player ingenuity, or a successful DC 16 Charisma (<wc-fetch type=skill>Persuasion</wc-fetch>) check. Doing so gains Moghadam&rsquo;s favor and advantage on further ability checks made to negotiate with the artificer, as you determine.</p>

However, you might decide that the muralists have their own reasons to flee servitude, and have secured a set of <wc-fetch type=item>claws of the umber hulk</wc-fetch> (see appendix C) to do so. They might also look for the characters' help to escape, using the claws to dig a secret tunnel beneath their chambers in <strong>area area 9</strong>â€”and potentially intersecting with the umber hulks' excavations.</p>

<p>If the black rocks from the chapel are brought to the sculptors, you might decide that they can help restore those victims to life using their superior mason&rsquo;s tools. Alternatively, the sculptors might want to incorporate these magic rocks into an even more impressive golem, helping to ensure their escape. Likewise, if taken to the Temple of Moloch, these rocks might be highly prized for the crafting of statues and homunculi.</p>

But depending on the setup of your campaign (and particularly if you are playing through Baldur&rsquo;s Gate: Descent into Avernus), you might instead have this rift lead to the Nine Hells. There, Tarnhem joins the demonic horde taking part in the Blood War.</p>

When the characters arrive, this thief presents themself as a seemingly reluctant guide willing to join the characters on the incursion into the temple. While there, they secretly try to direct the characters toward rescuing the imprisoned thieves.</p>
<p>Mack Francache the wererat prisoner (<strong>area area 9</strong>) might instead be a lycanthrope of some kind never seen before: a weremouse, a weremoose, or even a wereooze.

For example, if the eidolon inhabits a statue of Zariel or Bel, the characters might gain advantage on attack rolls against that statue if they serve the archdevil&rsquo;s agent (or disadvantage on attack rolls against the statue of the competing agent&rsquo;s patron). Out of combat, if the characters are allied with Moghadam and remove a hand and an eye from any statue, Vecna rewards them with some boon (advantage on attack rolls during the first round of their next fight, having a consumable magic item appear in the statue&rsquo;s remaining hand, and so forth).</p>

<p>The characters are then asked to drive the war machine into Avernus, to confront the minions of the archdevil opposed by their agent and thwart that archdevil&rsquo;s plans. Alternatively, the <em>Infernal War Machine</em> might be teleported to the Nine Hells, where the characters later encounter it during the course of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate: Descent into Avernus and are required to stop it.</p>

<p>So many of the iconic locations in D&D would make great additions to this adventure, from the tower of Sorcere in Menzoberranzan, to one of the elemental nodes in Princes of the Apocalypse, to the level of Dweomercore in Dungeon of the Mad Mage, to Skyreach Castle in Hoard of the Dragon Queen.

You can play him as an archmageâ€”or for higher-level parties, use his stat block from Tomb of Annihilation, but without his undead traits, his Rejuvenation and Turn Resistance traits, and his Disrupt Life legendary action. Acererak does not reside in the Tomb of Horrors at the time the characters travel there in chapter 3, but he might appear if its construction is hindered. He is keen on preventing characters from utterly destroying the tomb, but might grace them with an audience if they look as though they could prove useful to furthering his plans.</p>
<p>If enmity arises between the characters and Acererak, the would-be lich is a formidable foe. You might make this special version of Acererak even more so by having him wielding a sword with a <wc-fetch type=item>sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch> fashioned into its blade, and with the matching <wc-fetch type=item>talisman of the sphere</wc-fetch> fashioned into the hilt.</p>

Acererak hired Tuerny to install magical technology obtained from the Barrier Peaks into the tomb (including the missing components), which now hold Tarnhem imprisoned here and drain his life force. Since leaving the tomb, Tuerny has used what he learned in crafting Tarnhem&rsquo;s prison to create the first of his fabled <wc-fetch type=item>Iron Flask</wc-fetch>]. If the characters choose to stay in the time frame of the under-construction tomb, they might find a map leading to Tuerny&rsquo;s fortress.</p>
