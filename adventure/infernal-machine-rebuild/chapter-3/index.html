<div class="gap-8 lg:grid items-start" style="grid-template-columns:auto 10rem">
<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>The Tomb of Horrors is one of the most legendary dungeons in the multiverse. Shaped by the demilich Acererak as a testing ground for would-be heroesâ€”and as a place to steal the souls of those heroes whose skills where found wantingâ€”the tomb has claimed countless lives over millennia, and even some of the most hardened adventurers would think twice about entering those deadly halls. But by going back into the past, the characters have a chance to explore a version of the Tomb of Horrors that few have ever seen, and to engage one of the world&rsquo;s deadliest dungeons on their own terms.</p>
<h2 id=background>
<a href=#background class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Background</h2><p>According to legend, Acererak was a tiefling fathered by a balor named Tarnhem. In his youth, he studied spellcasting under Vecna, and has since become an archmage of surpassing evil. While researching the means to achieve lichdom, Acererak built a number of dungeons and tombs, including his famed Tomb of Horrors. Those dungeons were created partly as a means to draw out and defeat those adventurers driven to seek and destroy himâ€”and partly to claim those adventurers' souls to feed his phylactery.</p>
<p>Even after Acererak eventually became an archlich whose dark plots would threaten the world, he left behind the Tomb of Horrors as a monument to his greatness. But in its earliest stages, the tomb was a very different sort of place.</p>
<p>By traveling to the Tomb of Horrors in the past, the characters arrive with the place still under construction. The artificer Moghadam serves as the tomb&rsquo;s chief architect, overseeing its construction in initial areas dug out by enthralled umber hulks and refined by master artisans. As part of the unprecedented levels of magic used to create the deadly traps in the Tomb of Horrors, Moghadam has installed several of the missing components from the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em> at the site. These components are used to draw magical energy from the life force of creatures sacrificed on Acererak&rsquo;s ordersâ€”including the archmage&rsquo;s own father, the balor Tarnhem.</p>
<p>Over the years of the tomb&rsquo;s construction, Moghadam and his rival artificer, Thessalar, have competed fiercely against each other&rsquo;s endeavors. Moghadam takes pleasure in having lured away several sculptors from Thessalar&rsquo;s temple to help with the tomb&rsquo;s construction. He has also recently sent a party of thieves and a master gemsmith to his rival&rsquo;s temple, instructing them to steal the temple&rsquo;s two most famous gemsâ€”set into the eyes of a great statue of Molochâ€”for use in the creation of Acererak&rsquo;s jeweled demilich skull. Unfortunately, those thieves have failed to return, and are presumed captured by Thessalar.</p>

Several of such figures have been included as NPCs, but you should not treat this adventure&rsquo;s approach to those characters as canon. Rather, use them to flesh out this particular adventure in &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; fashion. Alternatively, if you prefer not to populate the adventure with such prominent names, you can substitute those characters with unnamed general NPCs who can fill the same roles.</p>
<p>Some of the NPCs in this section of the adventure (including Moghadam) are a much more potent threat than characters of the lower levels suggested for the adventure can safely deal with. The players should be forewarned that their characters should treat with such legendary figures carefullyâ€”a warning that is repeated by whichever agent the characters are dealing with.</p>

As such, he considers the design of the Tomb of Horrors to be his masterwork. If questioned about his motivations, he claims that Acererak took his family hostage, and will not release them until Moghadam completes his work. The truth is that the artificer has no family. He delights in creating despair, and works on the tomb in the hope that his name will go down alongside Acererak&rsquo;s in legend.</p>
<p>Moghadam competes with a rival artificer named Thessalar, who operates out of a temple dedicated to Moloch some distance away. Moghadam has lured away several of Thessalar&rsquo;s expert sculptors to come work on the tomb, promising them great wealth that he has no intention of paying. More recently, the architect sent his own expert gemsmith along with a group of thieves to the Temple of Moloch, so that they might steal the gemstone eyes from its most famous statue. However, the thieves were captured, and Moghadam is now without the gemstones or his gemsmith, and plots the means to seize both.</p>

In this age, Nolzur most recently studied with Thessalar, learning secrets of alchemy and infusing his own blood with strange and dangerous properties. Moghadam learned of all this and captured Nolzur. He is now held in the tomb, with his blood used as a base material for magic pigments.</p>

Acererak spread these rumors, relying on combat between Pentival and Tarnhem to weaken them both, after which he could capture and imprison them for his own purposes.</p>
<p>Pentival uses the half-red dragon veteran stat block, but has the form of a gold dragon. He can be found in the chapel of evil (<strong>area area 14</strong>), forced to take part in the evil ceremony there. Though Pentival has been forced to watch his fellow paladins succumb one by one to the ceremony, he has so far held out, his devotion somehow keeping him alive.</p>

He first occupied an abandoned temple filled with girallons, where Acererak found and recruited him with promises of power and glory.</p>
<p>Although Phenex remains fanatically loyal to Vecna (even to the point of removing one of his eyes and his left hand), Acererak finds him useful to his own cause as well. (The mortal Acererak still ostensibly pledges his own faith to Vecna at this time.) Since arriving at the tomb along with many of his girallons, Phenex has magically grafted on a second set of arms, making him resemble something of a girallon himself.</p>

<p>Construction of the Tomb of Horrors is well underway, focused on three tunnels being dug into the north end of a flat-topped hill covered in ugly weeds, thorns, and briars. An active workers' camp occupies the north end of the hill, above the tunnels.</p>

<p>The rocky hill into which the tomb is being built is approximately six hundred feet wide, nine hundred feet long, and sixty feet high. Characters who ascend the hill to search the top discover a number of large black rocks dumped there. (The rocks will later be placed into the pattern of a grinning humanoid skull). A successful DC 18 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>, <wc-fetch type=skill>Nature</wc-fetch>, or <wc-fetch type=skill>Religion</wc-fetch>) check identifies the rocks as the remains of living creatures that have been reshaped to stone by dark magic.

If talked to, they grumble about their poor food and lack of pay, with the two groups blaming each other for every worksite mishap and grievance. They flee into the tomb if threatened, but fight with picks and shovels if cornered.</p>
<p>Each Dwarven Worker uses the cultist stat block with the following changes:</p>

<p>This entrance opens up to a large stone chamber. At the far end, an intense-looking man stands behind a large stone table covered in a dense layer of plans, drawings, and other documents. Tiny wax golems, their heads all lit wicks of flame, flit about the place, keeping the objects under his gaze well illuminated.</p>
<p>The man raises his head and intones: &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;ve come to engage in this grand endeavor. Are you miners, sculptors, artists? Or, I suspect, something else entirely?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moghadam the artificer manages the design and construction of the Tomb of Horrors from this office. He knows he has nothing to fear from the characters, and has little personal loyalty to Acererak. As such, he is happy to listen to any tale the characters tell, and to entertain any deal they might offer.</p>

In truth, he has no intention of parting with them and looks to subvert any deal, ideally by luring the characters to the evil chapel (<strong>area area 14</strong>).</p>
<p><span class="block -mx-6 lg:-mx-28">

</span></p>
<p>The artificer talks of having a number of tasks that the characters can help him with, and says he will trade the components for either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters must travel to the Temple of Moloch (see chapter 4) to rescue the gemsmith Seodra and any surviving thieves sent there. They must then help those operatives complete their mission to steal the gemstone eyes from the temple&rsquo;s greatest statue.</li>
<li>The characters can instead travel to the temple to facilitate a prisoner exchange, taking Nolzur and some of the sculptors working the tomb to exchange for the gemsmith.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distance between the Tomb of Horrors and the Temple of Moloch is left to your determination, as are the details of the overland journey. If you don&rsquo;t want to play out that journey, the characters' mechanical guide can use its teleportation ability to take them to the temple.</p>
<p>If the characters have already been at large within the tomb and caused trouble, Moghadam might decide he&rsquo;s better off being rid of them. In that event, he might offer to trade the components in exchange for the characters meeting with Phenex and assisting in his ceremony (expecting that the priest will dispense with them), or recapturing the balor if the characters' actions have freed it (hoping that the resulting battle finishes the characters off).</p>
<p>If the characters enter into a deal with Moghadam, he writes them a magic pass that allows them to travel the tomb without being attacked by the girallons therein. Moghadam can communicate telepathically with anyone carrying a pass, and can teleport into an unoccupied space next to anyone carrying a pass.</p>

<p>This area is noisy with the sounds of hammering and stone cutting coming from the west (areas 8 and 10). If the umber hulks are digging, a rumbling can also be heard to the east.

<p>At the end of this hall, some sort of horrible binding process is underway. A balor is held against the wall, pressed in against the stonework design of a great green devil&rsquo;s face. A black sphere holds the demon in place, and appears to be slowly draining away its essence.</p>

<p>The balor Tarnhem is bound here by the magic of Acererak, who has fashioned a device from a <wc-fetch type=item>sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch> that slowly drains away Tarnhem&rsquo;s essence to fuel the magical workings of the tomb.</p>

To convince them to do so, the fiend promises anything within his power. As a show of good faith, he can relate how to safely open the treasure chests in <strong>area area 13</strong>, and how his weapons have been taken to the chapel (<strong>area area 14</strong>) and worked into the altar there.</p>
<p>Tarnhem uses the balor stat block with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>While held, Tarnhem is <wc-fetch type=condition>incapacitated</wc-fetch> but can still speak.</li>
<li>Until he recovers his weapons from the chapel, his Longsword and Whip actions are replaced by the following action option: <em><strong>Fist of Retribution</strong>.</em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (<wc-roll>2d4 + 8</wc-roll>) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (<wc-roll>2d6</wc-roll>) fire damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If released, Tarnhem upholds any agreement he made to not harm the characters. He instead focuses his wrath on Moghadam and Phenex, hunting both down before vanishing into the rift to the Lower Planes in <strong>area area 16</strong>.</p>
<p>If the balor is released, the sphere binding him becomes a <wc-fetch type=item>sphere of annihilation</wc-fetch> and is unmoored. It travels throughout the tomb at random, though is confined by the tomb&rsquo;s magic to stay within its rooms and corridors rather than boring through the walls. This sphere can be controlled as normal while within the tomb, but it cannot leave.</p>
<p>If Tarnhem is not freed, the balor is eventually drained away to become part of a horrible monument. His life force fuels the black sphere in the mouth of the great green devil face in this area when the Tomb of Horrors is complete.</p>

The artisan Nolzur (a neutral male human master thief, but he is reduced to 1 hit point) has been captured and held here, his alchemical blood continually drained to create the magic pigments used to paint the tomb&rsquo;s murals. The muralists drain him with tools crafted from the beaks of stirges, keeping him barely alive with healing magic.</p>
<p>Nolzur is too weak to escape on his own, but if rescued and provided healing and nourishment, he gladly aids the characters in any way. This includes telling the characters the general layout of the Temple of Moloch, and revealing Thessalar&rsquo;s vulnerability to magic potions and salves that restore hit points (see &ldquo;<strong>area Who Dwells Here?</strong>&rdquo; in chapter 4).</p>

Five are present when the characters first enter this area, watched over and assisted by a girallon. The sculptors (use the cultist stat block) traveled here from the Temple of Moloch under the false promise of fabulous payment for helping construct the tomb. They have since found themselves unable to leave.</p>
<p>The sculptors seek assistance to escape the tomb, and provide whatever information they know in exchange for aid. They can relate how the rest of the sculptors (in <strong>area area 10</strong>) are devising a means of escape using a set of superior <wc-fetch type=item>mason&rsquo;s tools</wc-fetch> hidden there, and that these tools can also weaken the eidolon in the Temple of Moloch (see <strong>area area 25</strong> in chapter 4).

Chapel of Evil</h3><blockquote>
<p>The chanting heard throughout the tomb originates in this chapel, whose pews are filled with more than two dozen worshipersâ€”and, oddly, with two large chunks of rough black stone. The chapel appears dedicated to Vecna, decorated with artwork and symbols in honor of the god of evil secrets. The worshipers, all humanoid, appear exhausted as they continue their chant. As you watch, one of them collapsesâ€”and is suddenly and horrifyingly <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> into another chunk of black stone.</p>
<p>At the far end of the chapel, a handsome priest stands behind an altar block that glows an opalescent blue. The priest is missing his left eye and hand, but has a second set of arms grafted to his body. All three of his arms gesture as if directing the worshipers like a conductor. Two girallons flank him, each of them also missing an eye and hand.</p>
<p>The priest smiles and gestures for you to enter the chapel and take a seat. And the chanting fills your mind with a desire to obey&mldr;</p>

None of the worshipers (except Pentival; see below) can take any actions beyond continuing to chant as long as the priest, Phenex, commands them.</p>

Drawn to the temple by rumors of its bound balor, Pentival and his party were quickly captured. All his friends have succumbed to the magic of the temple and been transformed into black rock, but Pentival has so far held out. Of all the worshipers, he alone can communicate with the characters, quickly explaining who he is and the nature of the ceremony.</p>
<p>If freed, Pentival joins the characters for the remainder of their time at the tomb. He uses the half-red dragon veteran stat block, but has the form of a gold dragon. However, he insists on keeping Tarnhem imprisoned, and on attempting to destroy Moghadam.</p>

As long as he commands the worshipers (using a bonus action each round), they maintain their chant.</p>
<p>In combat, Phenex first orders the girallons to attack. As needed, he then uses his Charm action to force a character or Pentival to defend him. Due to his fanatic devotion, Phenex does not use his Etherealness action to escape a fight, but remains in the chapel to the bitter end.</p>

They continue to chant while they are physically able and while Phenex commands them. The ceremony fuels Phenex as well, allowing him to maintain it without need for sustenance or sleep.</p>
<p>Anyone entering the chapel while the ceremony is underway must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall under an effect equivalent to a <wc-fetch type=spell>mass suggestion</wc-fetch> spell. While a character is under this effect, Phenex can direct them to sit and join the ceremony. Any character who does so takes up the chant, and has their Constitution score reduced by 1 each round on initiative count 0. A character reduced to 0 hit points while under this effect dies and has their body and all possessions transformed into a chunk of black rock (see below). A character under the effect of the ceremony can make another saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the effect with a success.</p>
<p>(This version of the ceremony is more potent than that suffered by the other worshipers, who would otherwise have all turned to black rock by now. Phenex is concentrating his magic in an effort to defeat the characters.)</p>
<p>If Phenex is defeated, any remaining worshipers immediately cease chanting and collapse into exhausted unconsciousness. Once a character is freed from the ceremony and out of combat, their hit point maximum is restored at a rate of 1 hit point per round. Anyone transformed into a black rock unfortunately remains in this condition.</p>

A <wc-fetch type=spell>greater restoration</wc-fetch> or <wc-fetch type=spell>wish</wc-fetch> spell can end the <wc-fetch type=condition>petrified</wc-fetch> condition for one victim, restoring them and their gear.</p>

There are three such components, each a deep sapphire blue. Removing one component safely requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, jeweler&rsquo;s tools, or tinker&rsquo;s tools.</p>
<p>In addition, Tarnhem&rsquo;s flaming whip and lightning-imbued longsword have also been worked into the altar. On a failed check to remove a missing component, these weapons cast a <wc-fetch type=spell>lightning bolt</wc-fetch> or a <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch> at the character making the check (a 50 percent chance for either spell; save DC 16 for both). If Tarnhem is freed, he comes here directly to recover these weapons, and is the only creature that can do so. Anyone else attempting to claim them automatically triggers a <wc-fetch type=spell>lightning bolt</wc-fetch> or a <wc-fetch type=spell>fireball</wc-fetch>.</p>

<p>A mithral door in the stone wall resembles the figure of a flattened tortle, its arms and legs extended to the four corners, and its shell carved with a complete map of the tomb. Its head is turned in profile, its eye set with a gleaming gem.</p>

A successful check removes the soul gem, which destroys the gem and unlocks the door.</p>
<p>A character who attempts to remove or destroy the gem in any other way must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) force damage.</p>

The fourth is a disguised trapper kept by Seodra as a pet, and which attacks anyone who passes by it except Seodra and Moghadam.</p>
<p>Once the characters move beyond the curtains, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This workshop features a number of tables covered in <wc-fetch type=item>jeweler&rsquo;s tools</wc-fetch> and materialsâ€”including three large diamonds. Set against the back wall is a couch upholstered in golden cloth, on which rests a headless body outfitted in elaborate robes.</p>

<p>The magic of the ritual that creates the skull shrinks down the great rubies of Moloch&rsquo;s eyes to fit the silver skull. The last stage of the ritual involves placing the finished skull atop the manikin in area 18a. The spirit of the archmage Acererak then possesses the manikin and transforms it into an eye of fear and flame. If the characters are present, they can treat with Acererak in this form.</p>
<p>The eye of fear and flame attacks at once if the characters are known to have undertaken any actions against Moghadam, the tomb, or its workers. If not, and if Acererak is impressed with their adventuring acumen, the archmage promises to grant a great boon in exchange for some measure of service necessary for the completion of his tomb. The details of the service are left to your determination. The boon can be the equivalent of a wish spell, though whether or not Acererak fulfills any promise is left to you to decide.</p>
