<div class="gap-8 lg:grid items-start" style="grid-template-columns:auto 10rem">
<article class="max-w-ch mx-auto px-6"><p>The Temple of Moloch is an ancient site steeped in magic, and the former home of a legendary artificer. Thessalar was a master alchemist and creator of monsters, whose own blood was said to possess dire magical properties. The artificer&rsquo;s mad plots, thirst for power, and pursuit of lichdom eventually left the temple a ruin long ago. But the characters now find themselves back in that long ago, facing off against the artificer and his host of monstrous guardians in pursuit of the missing components of the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em>. Having come back in time, the characters have a unique opportunity to explore a site now lost to memory—and to lay claim to its legendary riches.</p>
<h2 id=background>
<a href=#background class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Background</h2><p>The Temple of Moloch was said to have begun as a series of caverns where the elemental princes Olhydra and Ogrémoch once battled, and in so doing, opened a rift to their respective Elemental Planes. This rift between the Plane of Water and the Plane of Earth resulted in a stream flowing through the caverns, which carries with it gemstones of extreme size and quality—particularly rubies. When ancient peoples came upon these gems, their greed led them to gather as many as possible, and to build a temple at the site to honor Moloch. They built an ornate statue to the exiled archdevil, and set two of the largest ruby gemstones for its eyes.</p>
<p>Centuries later, one of the high priests of the temple, an artificer named Thessalar, was so seduced by power and authority that he slew most of his fellow cultists in a bloody ceremony, then took control of the temple for himself. Thessalar repurposed the chambers of the temple for his own experiments, creating numerous monsters that bore his name (including the thessalhydra), as well as unnatural beasts such as the owlbear that would one day spread across the world.</p>
<p>Several of the missing components of the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em> made their way to the temple through the years. At the time the characters visit, Thessalar has installed these components in his lab equipment, channeling their magic for the purpose of endless mutation.</p>
<p>Over the years that were the height of Thessalar&rsquo;s power in the temple, the artificer&rsquo;s chief rival was the artificer Moghadam, architect of the Tomb of Horrors. Moghadam recently lured away several sculptors from Thessalar&rsquo;s temple to help construct his tomb, with false promises of vast salaries. To add insult to injury, Moghadam then sent back a party of mercenary thieves and a master gemsmith to steal the temple&rsquo;s most famous gems—the eyes of the great statue of Moloch that is the centerpiece of the site. These thieves came under the pretense of delivering animal subjects for Thessalar&rsquo;s experiments, but were captured. The gemsmith Seodra is now forced to labor for Thessalar, while the thieves are the subjects of dark experiments. All are desperate to escape.</p>

<a href=#who-dwells-here class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Who Dwells Here?</h2><p>As with the Tomb of Horrors, this version of the temple takes place in a period of the distant past, and incorporates rare elements of D&D lore. You are, of course, free to use or not use such elements—Thessalar, the creation of the owlbear, and so forth—as you see fit. You can easily substitute Thessalar or any other NPCs in the adventure with characters specific to your campaign, or with general NPCs who can fill the same roles.</p>
<p>Several of the temple&rsquo;s residents (including Thessalar, his thessalkraken, and the eidolon) are a much more potent threat than characters of the lower levels suggested for the adventure can safely deal with. The players should be forewarned that their characters should treat with such legendary figures carefully—a warning that is repeated by whichever agent the characters are dealing with.</p>
<h3 id=andras-and-stolos>
<a href=#andras-and-stolos class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Andras and Stolos</h3><p>One of Thessalar&rsquo;s most loyal assistants, Andrastolos was the subject of many of the artificer&rsquo;s early magical trials. In a grand experiment, Andrastolos&rsquo;s body and mind were split across two separate beings: Andras and Stolos. Although they both operate in the temple, their split nature and the memory of who they once were disturbs Andras and Stolos so much that they seek each other&rsquo;s ruin. The only thing that keeps both from killing the other is a desperate belief that their original natures might somehow be restored.</p>
<h4 id=andras>
<a href=#andras class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Andras</h4><p>Andras is a neutral evil male human assassin with the head of a giant snowy owl. Though he retains his full intellect, his speech is hindered, resembling the hoots and clicks of an owl. Cruel and sadistic, Andras has been installed as the temple&rsquo;s torturer. When the characters arrive, he is overseeing the interrogation of Moghadam&rsquo;s thieves and their wererat leader, Mack Francache. See <strong>area area 9</strong> for Andras&rsquo;s full statistics.</p>
<h4 id=stolos>
<a href=#stolos class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Stolos</h4><p>A reverse of Andras, the neutral Stolos possesses the head of an aging man atop the body of a giant owl. Garrulous and inquisitive, Stolos has been installed as the temple&rsquo;s warden, overseeing the prison and the unfortunate creatures held there. Stolos is a warlock of the Great Old One, but see <strong>area area 11</strong> for his full statistics.</p>
<h3 id=ard-sagart>
<a href=#ard-sagart class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Ard-Sagart</h3><p>Under Thessalar, the high priests of the temple are chosen from sculptors who craft such perfect statues that the temple&rsquo;s resident eidolon (containing the spirit of the first high priest) selects them for its use. As the temple&rsquo;s current high priest, Ard-Sagart (a lawful evil male human warlock of the fiend) believes that the wayward sculptors who left for the Tomb of Horrors have caused the temple to lose favor with Moloch. He is eager to rectify this situation by recovering as many gemstones as possible from the temple&rsquo;s waters as tribute.</p>
<h3 id=barbatos>
<a href=#barbatos class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Barbatos</h3><p>The ranger Barbatos (a neutral evil male human; see appendix B for his stat block) uses his tracking, stealth, and combat prowess to trap creatures for selfish gain. He has long worked for Thessalar, trapping animals and monsters to be used in the temple&rsquo;s experiments. As part of his wages, Barbatos has undergone his own experimentation, with Thessalar wiring items made from living creatures directly into the ranger&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Barbatos is always accompanied by his animal companion, a hell hound named Sadie III.</p>
<h3 id=mack-francache>
<a href=#mack-francache class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Mack Francache</h3><p>This neutral wererat thief is the leader of the band sent to the temple by Moghadam, and charged with stealing the ruby eyes from the temple&rsquo;s great statue of Moloch. Having failed in his assignment, Francache now languishes in the temple&rsquo;s torture chamber.</p>
<h3 id=seodra>
<a href=#seodra class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Seodra</h3><p>A lawful neutral female genasi from the Quasi-elemental Plane of Mineral, Seodra is a gemsmith who studied under Xagy, the mysterious figure who crafted such masterpiece artifacts as <em>Queen Ehlissa&rsquo;s Marvelous Nightingale</em>. Seodra accompanied Mack Francache and his thieves to the temple, as her expertise was needed to steal the gem eyes of the great statue of Moloch without damaging them. With the gems in hand, Seodra would have been able to craft the jeweled skull of a demilich for Acererak. Unfortunately, she was captured along with the rest of the thieves, and is now forced to work for Thessalar—crafting the same jeweled skull for his own use. See <strong>area area 31</strong> for her statistics.</p>
<h3 id=thessalar>
<a href=#thessalar class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Thessalar</h3><p>As an artificer, Thessalar is vainglorious, egotistical, and utterly ruthless in furthering his research. His career began as a priest in the service of Moloch, where he rose through the ranks before eventually taking over the temple as a working laboratory. Most of his experiments have involved the pursuit of new forms of life, resulting in such creatures as the thessalhydra and the owlbear. In recent years, he has also researched the prolonging of life—namely his own. Thessalar hopes that by becoming a lich, his research and experiments can continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>Over time, Thessalar has subjected himself to so many of his own experiments that his blood has taken on alchemical and magical properties. He regularly uses it as the basis for many of the reagents used throughout his labs. As a side effect, although Thessalar is now immune to poison and the <wc-fetch type=condition>poisoned</wc-fetch> condition, any magical liquid or salve that restores hit points acts as a poison against him if applied to a piercing or slashing weapon.</p>
<p>Several of Thessalar&rsquo;s prized sculptors have been lured away from the temple by Moghadam, his rival artificer, with promises of false payment to help construct the Tomb of Horrors. Worse, the sculptors took with them their best tools and half a <wc-fetch type=item>manual of stone golems</wc-fetch>. Both items were part of Thessalar&rsquo;s plans to craft a powerful stone golem and send it against Moghadam and his tomb. More recently, Moghadam ordered a group of thieves to assault the temple and steal the gemstone eyes from its great statue of Moloch. Thessalar captured the thieves and put the gemsmith accompanying them to work, but the temple still remains on alert against intruders.</p>

The villagers—quiet, nervous folk—can provide lodging, meager supplies to trade, and directions to the temple.</p>
<p>From the village, a two-mile trek along a seldom-used road ends at the edge of a fen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A general bleakness hangs over this area, with only a few clumps of brush and tamarack sprouting here and there. Through this, a narrow causeway leads out to a low mound, upon which stand the outer walls of what must be the temple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upper levels of the temple are abandoned and falling to ruin, as Thessalar focuses his activities in the dungeons below. Once the characters cross the causeway, they easily spot a stone staircase leading down.</p>

Different areas provide information on lizardfolk guards heading out on patrol and monsters potentially breaking free and running amok. When that happens, keep a rough idea of where those guards and monsters might be heading, and let the characters hear or see them as they skulk about. Not every encounter with a wandering monster or patrol needs to end in combat, but knowing that they don&rsquo;t have free run of the dungeon will help keep the characters on their toes.</p>
<p>In addition to those potential encounters, two unusual monsters also patrol the temple complex, and can be encountered at any time, wandering through any corridors or rooms—a thessalhydra and another creation of Moghadam&rsquo;s known as the thessalheart construct.</p>
<h4 id=thessalhydra>
<a href=#thessalhydra class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Thessalhydra</h4><p>When the characters first enter the temple, roll a <wc-roll>d4</wc-roll>. On a 1–2, the temple&rsquo;s guardian thessalhydra is patrolling the laboratory section (areas 1 to 23). On a 3–4, it patrols the temple section (areas 24 to 39). There are no fixed mechanics for encounters with the thessalhydra, but feel free to have it show up in the distance whenever the characters need incentive to keep moving. The thessalhydra ignores lizardfolk guards and known servants of Thessalar, but attacks all other creatures on sight. Accustomed to inspiring fear, and having grown somewhat lazy in its guardian role, it is usually content to let foes flee from it rather than pursuing.</p>
<p>Each time the characters finish a long rest in the temple, the thessalhydra leaves its current zone and takes up a patrol in the other zone. The thessalheart construct switches to the opposite zone (see below).</p>
<h4 id=thessalheart-construct>
<a href=#thessalheart-construct class="header-link icon text-gray-300" aria-label=(anchor)><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a>Thessalheart Construct</h4><p>The thessalheart construct is a strange magical-mechanical device that struts about like a chicken, and which features a human heart beating madly behind its glass front. The construct always wanders the zone opposite to the thessalhydra&rsquo;s zone, and for good reason.</p>
<p>The human heart that sits within the construct is magically connected to the thessalhydra, tapping into the power of the <em>Infernal Machine</em> components as it roams, and feeding that power to the monster as restorative energy. Whenever the thessalhydra is taken to 0 hit points, it stays dead for 1 hour before returning to life with full hit points. Destroying the construct or claiming all the <em>Infernal Machine</em> components is the only way to end this effect.</p>
<p>The thessalheart construct has a telepathic bond to Thessalar, who becomes aware of the characters through the construct&rsquo;s senses if they encounter it as they wander. If encountered, the construct gets close enough to identify the characters, then attempts to flee to protect itself.</p>

Office of the Torturer</h3><p>Characters approaching this area from the north can see activity through the open doorway to <strong>area area 9</strong>, but can&rsquo;t make out any details until they advance beyond the corridor leading into <strong>area area 8</strong>.</p>
<p>This chamber serves as the office and apartment of Andras, the temple&rsquo;s torturer and rival of the warden. It holds a bed, a desk, and mundane gear. The desk contains notes on tortured prisoners and any information they&rsquo;ve revealed (including the fact that the recently captured thieves were sent by Moghadam). If he is not at work in <strong>area area 9</strong>, Andras will be found here.</p>

<p>In addition, a locked strongbox can be found under Andras&rsquo;s bed. It can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, but contains an easily noticed poison needle trap. A failed check triggers the trap, which deals 1 piercing damage and delivers a dose of <wc-fetch type=item>Blood of the Lycanthrope</wc-fetch> (see appendix C). The strongbox can be smashed open with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>
<p>The strongbox holds treasure collected from Andras&rsquo;s recent victims—110 sp, 55 gp, 10 pp, five rubies (worth 100 gp each), and a vial of <wc-fetch type=item>mummy rot antidote</wc-fetch> (see appendix C).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A low groaning rises from this chamber, whose open doorway provides a hint of its source. This is a torture chamber, filled with racks, implements of pain, and other foul devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the characters enter, read the following, making adjustments as necessary if Andras is not here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two prisoners and a frantic rat lie strapped to tables, and are being worked on by a humanoid figure with the head of a snowy owl. Silver wires connect the tables to a complex control panel standing between them.</p>

Like that of any owl, his head can rotate almost fully around for 360-degree vision.</p>
<p>The prisoners are two of Moghadam&rsquo;s thieves, who Andras is pressing for additional information as to their raid and Moghadam&rsquo;s plans. However, the torturer is almost impossible to understand, with his speech resembling the hoots and clicks of an owl. Conversing with Andras requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Insight</wc-fetch>) check or a <wc-fetch type=spell>speak with animals</wc-fetch> spell, but the torturer speaks to the characters only in bold threats. In combat, Andras uses weapons coated in <wc-fetch type=item>Blood of the Lycanthrope</wc-fetch> (see appendix C). He uses the assassin stat block with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is neutral evil, and can speak and understand Common and Giant Owl.</li>
<li>Andras has advantage on Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) checks that rely on hearing or sight.</li>
<li>The poison effect on his shortsword and light crossbow attacks is replaced with the following: If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wererat lycanthropy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Andras carries keys that open the concealed door leading to <strong>area area 23</strong>.</p>

His lycanthropic blood is being drained for study by Thessalar, who has already discovered ways in which it might be weaponized (see &ldquo;<strong>area Poisons</strong>&rdquo; in appendix C).</p>
<p>The silver wires connect Francache to a lawful neutral female human bandit captain named Big Gadai (sister to the dead thief in <strong>area area 6</strong>) and a normal rat. As Andras operates the controls to this strange torture device, he causes Francache&rsquo;s lycanthropy to transform the rat into a duplicate of Big Gadai, to the pain and horror of everyone involved. When the rat is in human form, it insists that it is the real Big Gadai, as does the real Big Gadai.</p>
<p>Francache bargains with the characters for his freedom, promising anything he can in return—including knowledge of the Tomb of Horrors. (His previous assignment for Moghadam was to spy on its workers while in rat form.)</p>

Removing this component deactivates the controls and releases the restraints on the tables, freeing Francache, Big Gadai, and the rat.</p>
<p>Anyone attempting to disrupt the controls or the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) force damage. The controls and the wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.</p>

It can be detected with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check. Without the key carried by Andras, its lock can be picked with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or it can be forced with a successful DC 18 Strength check.</p>

If Andras and Stolos are both at this location, spending 3 charges results in both transforming back into their original forms—the human Andrastolos and his giant snowy owl companion. If restored to normal, Andrastolos uses Andras&rsquo;s statistics but his alignment reverts to neutral. He is endlessly grateful to the characters, providing any information about the temple he can (he is familiar with areas 1 through 23), and offering to guide the party as needed.</p>

<p>If asked about his unusual appearance, Stolos angrily admits that he and Andras derived from a singular human subject and his giant snowy owl companion years before. The two hybrid creatures now have an intense hatred for one another, owing to a mutual disgust for their split nature.</p>
<p>Stolos offers to work with the characters if they harm or impede Andras (most easily by freeing the prisoners being tortured in <strong>area area 9</strong>). His only real aim is for the characters to sow chaos before the temple&rsquo;s guards invariably deliver them back into his custody.</p>
<p>Stolos uses the warlock of the Great Old One stat block with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is neutral evil.</li>
<li>He has a flying speed of 30 feet.</li>

<p>Amazing instruments of complex design fill this laboratory, all seemingly engaged in active experimentation. Facing the doorway is a wooden desk, its legs resembling four small dryads whose outstretched hands are clasped together to support a desktop littered with thick tomes, alchemical vessels, and a complex control panel.</p>
<p>An ancient male human sits behind the desk, with a homunculus perched on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More of Moghadam&rsquo;s mercenaries, I presume?&rdquo; the figure asks wearily. &ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t disposed of the last poor souls the so-called master of the tomb sent here.&rdquo; The homunculus then pulls the alchemist&rsquo;s face into an expression of wry contempt.</p>

<li>Glass piping connects tanks holding strange liquids and materials, all in an ongoing state of transmutation.</li>
<li>A miniaturized human lies in apparent stasis in a windowed glass case.</li>

In truth, he will never part with them as long as they fuel his experiments, and he looks to subvert any deal by eventually feeding the characters to the thessalkraken in the subterranean lake.</p>
<p>In exchange for the components in his possession, Thessalar proposes any of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters can travel to the Tomb of Horrors (see chapter 3) to recover Seodra&rsquo;s plans for crafting the jeweled skull of a demilich, as well as the remaining jeweled teeth (both in <strong>area area 18a</strong> of the tomb). This will allow the captured gemsmith to complete the skull for Thessalar instead.</li>
<li>The characters can instead travel to the tomb to either facilitate a prisoner exchange (offering Seodra for Thessalar&rsquo;s missing sculptors), or to disrupt its construction by stealing Moghadam&rsquo;s plans for the tomb.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distance between the Temple of Moloch and the Tomb of Horrors is left to your determination, as are the details of the overland journey. If you don&rsquo;t want to play out that journey, the characters' mechanical guide can use its teleportation ability to take them to the tomb.</p>
<p>If the characters have already caused trouble in the temple, or if Thessalar suspects they will, he might just task them with the &ldquo;easy challenge&rdquo; of collecting gemstones from the temple&rsquo;s subterranean lake as replacements for the missing components—without mentioning the thessalkraken that dwells there.</p>

If the homunculus is destroyed, the eidolon in the main temple (<strong>area area 25</strong>) must immediately use its Incorporeal Movement trait to enter the nearest available sacred statue, where it remains trapped. If no sacred statues are available, the eidolon is destroyed.</p>
<p>Thessalar&rsquo;s homunculus uses the normal stat block with the following change:</p>
<ul>
<li>The homunculus has the following additional attack option: <strong><em>Acidic Spittle</em>.</strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (<wc-roll>1d6 + 2</wc-roll>) acid damage.</li>

Body Tanks</h3><p>If the characters have met Thessalar already, they recognize the bodies in the tank as the artificer. Adjust the following read-aloud text accordingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chamber holds a half-dozen floor-to-ceiling glass tanks, four of which are filled with a light-blue fluid in which the body of an elderly male human is suspended. Three of the bodies appear lifeless and inert. The fourth looks toward you and mouths silent words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thessalar maintains several clones in tanks of preserving chemicals here, prepared by the spell of the same name and awaiting his use. Three clones are inert. The fourth has managed to gain a degree of sentience from its proximity to the magic of the missing components of the <em>Infernal Machine</em>, and mouths its demand to be set free. If freed, it claims to be the true Thessalar and that the artificer in <strong>area area 15</strong> is an impostor.</p>
<p>Any freed clone uses the same stat block as Thessalar (see appendix C) but lacks his special equipment and his homunculus.</p>

With a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>Arcana</wc-fetch>) check or a <wc-fetch type=spell>detect magic</wc-fetch> spell, a character discerns that the gem eyes are a focal point for the magic of the temple, and are magically connected to the various control panels making use of the missing components from the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em>. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (<wc-fetch type=skill>Perception</wc-fetch>) check made to examine the gems reveals that they are connected to the statue with silver wires similar to those seen in Thessalar&rsquo;s labs.</p>
<p>The gems can be removed with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. However, doing so deactivates any control panel still utilizing components from the <em>Infernal Machine</em> in the temple (in areas 9, 14, 15, 16, and 22). This disrupts the experiments and frees the bound creatures in all those areas.</p>
<p>The eidolon in this area (see below) can enter the statue to transform it into a sacred statue. The statue can be attacked to destroy it, preventing the eidolon from animating it. When not occupied by the eidolon, the statue has AC 17, 50 hit points, resistance to piercing and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The statue is also vulnerable to the set of superior mason&rsquo;s tools found in <strong>area area 11</strong> of chapter 3. A character proficient with mason&rsquo;s tools can use the superior set to destroy the statue with a successful DC 13 Dexterity check.</p>

Office of the Demogorgon</h3><p>This area houses an ettin, originally brought here for Thessalar&rsquo;s experiments. The giant is kept both for his blood supply, which Thessalar uses in the crafting of new two-headed creatures, and as a guard for the treasure vault (<strong>area area 38</strong>).</p>
<p>As the characters approach the entrance to this area, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A deep voice cries out through the open doorway ahead, quickly responded to by a second voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! You come to honor Emmanuel, right head of the Demogorgon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! You honor Hebediah, left head of Demogorgon!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the characters can see into this area, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This filthy chamber is occupied by an ettin who is the source of the bellowing. The right head of the creature sports a stylish beard, while the left head has a large, curving mustache. Silver wires extend from a large pouch hanging around the giant&rsquo;s two necks, connecting directly into his chest. A pig snoozes on the floor at the ettin&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand still!&rdquo; one head roars. &ldquo;My steward Slippy will present you for a formal audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! My steward Sticky will present you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both heads then ignore you as they begin bellowing over one another for Slippy and Sticky to attend them.</p>

See appendix B for &ldquo;The Demogorgon&rdquo; stat block. At one time, he was told that he was a statue of Demogorgon brought to life by Thessalar&rsquo;s experiments. He has since come to believe that he is now the actual Demogorgon, with his two heads addressing one another as Aameul and Hathradiah—mispronounced as Emmanuel and Hebediah, respectively. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (<wc-fetch type=skill>History</wc-fetch>) check allows a character to recall the real names of Demogorgon&rsquo;s heads.</p>

</span>
</p>
<p>Much like the true Demogorgon, the ettin&rsquo;s two heads constantly clash and refuse to speak directly with one another, instead relaying messages through their assigned stewards (housed in areas 36 and 37).</p>
<p>If the ettin is defeated, examining the pouches around his necks reveals a collection of eyeballs and still-beating dragon hearts. The silver wires connect those living tissues to the ettin&rsquo;s own hearts, providing the creature&rsquo;s unique features. This setup is made permanently inoperable if the ettin is slain.</p>
<p>Anyone attempting to disrupt the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (<wc-roll>2d10</wc-roll>) force damage. The wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.</p>

If not in this area, the boggle is in area 37.</p>
<p>This boggle was one of two caught trying to use their Dimensional Rift traits to reach into the temple&rsquo;s treasure vault (<strong>area area 38</strong>). As punishment, they were assigned to provide care and grooming to the ettin&rsquo;s left and right heads, as well as relaying messages on the giant&rsquo;s behalf. When the ettin wants to talk to himself, one head gives the message to his steward, who runs off to deliver it to the other steward, who runs back to deliver it to the other head, and back down the line.</p>
<p>The two stewards are identical except for an epaulet worn on the left or right shoulder of their livery, but they have of late never been seen together. This is because only one boggle remains, the companion boggle having been disposed of in <strong>area area 7</strong>. Both stewards are thus now the same creature, who works hard to make sure this is never discovered. The boggle intuits (correctly) that if the ettin were to uncover this secret, he would rip the boggle in half as a furious means of getting the proper number of stewards once more.</p>

<p>If 1 more charge is subsequently spent, things instead rewind and the ettin forgets all. The steward realizes they have been saved and is eternally grateful to the characters, helping them in any way possible.</p>

The main cavern, reached by the stairs at <strong>area area 30</strong> or 39, is filled by a subterranean lake fed by the stream at <strong>area area 2</strong>.</p>
<p>When the characters descend the stairs at <strong>area area 30</strong> or area 39, read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stairs end abruptly, opening up to a vast natural cavern deep beneath the temple. A pebbly beach extends toward the dark waters of a subterranean lake that fills the cavern, a cold wind blowing across it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters have light sources with them, anyone peering into the water notes a dull red gleam where a raw ruby sits at the bottom of the lake near the shore.</p>
<p>Any creature setting foot on the beach or entering the water must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (<wc-fetch type=skill>Stealth</wc-fetch>) check or rouse the dread creature lurking within the lake.</p>

When the characters arrive here, the bottom of the lake is littered with <wc-roll>1d10</wc-roll> rubies. Roll a <wc-roll>d10</wc-roll> to determine the value of each ruby found—</p>
<ul>
<li>1–5: 10 gp</li>
<li>6–7: 25 gp</li>
<li>8–9: 100 gp</li>
<li>10: 200 gp</li>
</ul>
<p>If all the rubies are claimed, it takes 24 hours for more rubies to appear in the lake.</p>
<p>The bottom of the lake is also covered with the cracked bones of the many creatures sacrificed to the thessalkraken, or who ran afoul of it while diving for gems.</p>

Spending 2 charges also causes <wc-roll>1d4</wc-roll> Lizardfolk Render to arrive, ready to brave the waters in search of gemstones.
